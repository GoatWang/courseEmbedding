Description:

TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention is for methods of use for the decomposition of peroxynitrite by metal complexes, novel pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use therefor. Particularly, the present invention now provides a method for treating selected diseases comprising the decomposition of peroxynitrite with the use of a compound which is a metal complex. This decomposition preferably produces benign agents preventing formation of deleterious decomposition products such as oxygen radicals and which also further prevents inactivation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) by the presence of peroxynitrite. Therefore, the method of use for selected metal complexes of the present invention, as well as novel pharmaceutical compositions for such use is for the treatment of diseases advantageously affected by treatment comprising decomposition of peroxynitrite at a rate accelerated over a natural background rate of decay which comprises administration of an rate-accelerating effective amount of the metal complex in unit dosage form. In other words, the methods of treatment and novel compositions of this invention provide a twofold benefit in the treatment of diseases (1) accelerated rate of catalytic decomposition of peroxynitrite and (2) protection of SOD against inactivation by peroxynitrite. Thus, the present invention provides for a method of treatment of human diseases advantageously affected by such decomposition by protection from the deleterious effects resulting from the presence of peroxynitrite in the human body not heretofore known. In addition, since protection against SOD inactivation is provided, such decomposition offers protection against diseases associated with the overproduction of superoxide. These diseases include ischemic reperfusion injuries such as stroke, head trauma and myocardial ischemia, sepsis, chronic or acute inflammation (such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease and the like), adult respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, side effects from drug treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes (not included for treatment by vanadium porphyrin complexes), multiple sclerosis, parkinson's disease, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and colitis and specific neuronal disorders, preferably ischemic reperfusion, inflammation, sepsis, multiple sclersis, parkinson's disease and stroke. BACKGROUND ART Nitric oxide (NO) is known for its dual physiological role as helpful messenger and harmful intermediate. Nitric oxide is shown to be generated in numerous cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, hepatocytes and endothelial cells. See Hibbs et al, Science, 1987,235,473-476; Rimele et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1988, 245, 102-111; Curran et al, J. Exp. Med., 1989, 170, 1769-1774; and Plamer et al, Nature, 1987, 327, 524-526; respectively. The chemical reaction responsible for the production of NO is catalyzed by a class of enzymes referred to as nitric oxide synthases (NOS) which convert L-arginine to citrulline and NO. Forstermann et al, Biochemical Pharmacology, 1991,42, 1849-1857. While the role of NO as a signaling molecule in the stimulation of guanylate cyclase is well established, (Monocada et al, Pharmacological Reviews, 1991, 43, 109-142), the origins of its cytoxicity remained unclear. Recently a body of compelling evidence surfaced which teaches that NO by itself may not be responsible for cell damage (See Absts. of 1st Annual Mtg. of Oxygen Society, Nov. 12-4, 1993, Charleston, S.C., "Nitric Oxide Requires Superoxide to Exert Bactericidal Activity" by L. Brunnelli and J. S. Beckman). Instead a more reactive species, peroxynitrite, produced by the reaction of superoxide and NO, is found to play a role in the cytotoxicity observed with the over-production of NO. Peroxynitrite is known to decompose via a process which is first order in protons. The rate of proton catalyzed decomposition of peroxynitrite (hereinafter "the natural background rate of decay") is understood from its study over a variety of pH ranges (see; Keith et al. J Chem Soc (A), p.90, 1969). When the pH is 7.4 and the temperature is maintained at 37° C., the observed rate for the decomposition of peroxynitrite is 3.6×10-1 sec-i (see Beckman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol 87, pp1620-1624, 1990). Beckman shows that peroxynitrite decomposition generates a strong oxidant with reactivity similar to hydroxyl radical, as assessed by the oxidation of deoxyribose or dimethyl sulfoxide with the further suggestion that superoxide dismutase protects vascular tissue stimulated to produce superoxide and NO under pathological conditions by preventing the formation of peroxynitrite. See Beckman et al, "Apparent Hydroxyl Radical Production by Peroxynitrite: Implications for Endothelial Injury from Nitric Oxide and Superoxide" in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 87, pp 1629-1624, February 1990. Further, it is well established that peroxynitrite decomposes to give the hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide, a potent nitrating agent. Both of these species are potent oxidants shown to react with lipid membrane and sulfhydryl moieties (See Radi et al "Peroxynitrite Oxidation of Sulfhydryls" in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 266, No. 7 March 5, pp 4244-4250, 1991). Hardy et al suggest the interaction of O2- with nitric oxide forms peroxynitrite or the protonation of O2- to form perhydroxyl radical is involved in the neutrophil-meditated killing of HAE cells (FASEB Meeting on Apr. 5-9, 1992 in Anaheim, Calif.) and further Hardy et al suggest a role for peroxynitrite in oxidative damage of human endothelial cells (Abstract in the "Experimental Biology" section of FASEB on Mar. 28-Apr. 1, 1993 in New Orleans, La.). In other words, harmful products from peroxynitrite decomposition is specifically taught by many references. In addition, it has been shown that the reaction of peroxynitrite with Mn and Fe SOD results in inactivation of the enzyme (See also Radi et al, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 1991, 288, 481-487). It is now known that peroxynitrite will also inactivate CuZn SOD. Thus, the effects of the decomposition of peroxynitrite; whether by the generation of damaging decomposition products or inactivation of SOD, in a wide variety of diseases are well documented. For example, a study assessing the deleterious effects of peroxynitrite on the rat colon is reported by Rachmilewitz et al in "Peroxynitrite-induced Rat Colitis: A New Model of Colonic Inflammation" from Gastroenterology 105 (6) 1993. Beckman et al in PCT/US91/07894 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 5,277,908) teach, specifically that peroxynitrite is formed by the reaction of superoxide (O2-) and nitric oxide in tissues subjected to ischemic, inflammatory or septic conditions. Beckman et al link SOD deficiencies and peroxynitrite to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Nature, Vol 364, 12 August 1993 and Hogg et al and Beckman et al., respectively, present a relationship between peroxynitrite and atherosclerosis in Biochemical Society Transactions, Vol. 21, received Dec. 22, 1992 and in "Extensive Nitration of Protein Tyrosines in Human Atherosclerosis Detected by Immunohistochemistry", Biol Chem. Hoppe-Sevler, Vol. 375, pp 81-88, February 1994. Further, the involvement of peroxynitrite in various disease states is found for lung diseases attributed to cigarette smoke, atherosclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cold-induced brain edema in Chem. Res. Toxicol., Vol. 5, No. 3, 1992 pp 425-431. See also "Cold-induced Brain Edema in Mice" in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol.268, No. 21 Issue of July 25, pp 15394-15398, 1993. More recently a spinal neuron toxicity assay has been developed by Scherch et al to screen for drugs which block peroxynitrite toxicity. (23rd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. D., Nov. 7-12, 1993 and abstracted in Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 19 (1-3) 1993 and Biosis 94:4951. Further, by preventing inactivation of SOD by reducing the presence of peroxynitrite the present invention also provides enhancement of known physiological benefits of superoxide dismutase in the treatment of diseases based on such benefits. In this regard SOD and its mimics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of diseases for the inhibition of an overproduction of superoxide and nitric oxide. Thus, the present invention relates to the known treatment for diseases by SOD and SOD mimics. The Beckman et al PCT application also teaches that SODs catalyze the dismutation of the oxygen radical superoxide and provides references which show SOD and variants thereof have been commonly utilized to prevent or reduce oxidation injury in the treatment of stroke and head trauma, myocardial ischemia, abdominal vascular occlusion, cystitis, and a variety of inflammatory conditions. Beckman et al PCT application also recognizes the presence of peroxynitrite in these same disease conditions associated with O2- without indicating the further improvements of the present invention. Further teachings to the diseases known to be associated with treatment by SOD or its mimics are found in EP Publication No. 0524161 (EP Appl. No. 92870097) which is incorporated by reference therefor. Porphyrin complexes are disclosed in U.S. Pat.

See, for example,   1) Diehl, H.; Hoch, C. C.; Inorganic Synthesis Vol 3. p 196. McGraw-Hill, New York (1950).   2) Srinivasan, K; Michaud, P.; Kochi, J. K; J. Am. Chem.Soc. 108, 2309-2320, (1986).   3) Samsel, E. G.; Srinivasan, K.; Kochi, J. K J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107, 7606-7617, (1985). The compounds of the present invention can possess one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers as well as in the form of racemic or nonracemic mixtures thereof. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment with an optically active acid. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active bases from these salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric molecules by reacting one or more secondary amine group(s) of the compounds of the invention with an optically pure acid in an activated form or an optically pure isocyanate. The synthesized diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to deliver the enantiomerically pure ligand. The optically active compounds of the invention can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials, such as natural amino acids. To screen metal complexes for peroxynitrite decomposition catalytic activity of the present invention, peroxynitrite is prepared and isolated as its sodium salt by the reaction of acidic hydrogen peroxide with sodium nitrite followed by rapid quenching with NaOH as set out by Halfpenny and Robinson, in J. Chem. So., 1952, 928-938. Peroxynitrite has an absorbance maximum at 302 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1670 M-1 cm-1. Therefore, it is possible to directly observe the decomposition of peroxynitrite by stop-flow spectrophotometric analysis by monitoring the decomposition of the absorbance at 302 nm. That is, such observation of the decomposition of peroxynitrite at a rate accelerated over the natural decomposition rate with the addition of the metal complex identifies a compound of the present invention. In addition, it is now found that peroxynitrite inactivates CuZnSOD enzyme in a concentration dependant manner. Since it is known peroxynitrite also inactivates MnSOD (See "Peroxynitrite-Mediated Tyrosine Nitration Catalyzed by Superoxide Dismutase" by Ischiropoulos et al in Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Vol. 298, No. 2, November 1, pp. 431-437, 1992), the present invention provides a compound which protects CuZnSOD from inactivation by peroxynitrite. In this manner the compound of the present invention is shown to be useful in treating a disease in a human advantageously affected by the presence of the SOD enzyme. That is, the treatment of the present invention is for a disease state either caused by the presence of a peroxynitrite of caused by the lack of the protective presence of the SOD enzyme such as in a myocardial infarct, stroke or an autoimmune disease. These latter diseases are also shown to be associated with the presence of peroxynitrite. These metal complexes are found to be within the present invention by determination of their decomposition effect on peroxynitrite as set out herein. Contemplated equivalents of the general formulas set forth above for the compounds and derivatives as well as the intermediates are compounds otherwise corresponding thereto and having the same general properties such as tautomers of the compounds and such as wherein one or more of the various R groups are simple variations of the substituents as defined therein, e.g., wherein substituents which are a higher alkyl group than that indicated, or where the tosyl groups are other nitrogen or oxygen protecting groups or wherein the O-tosyl is a halide. Anions having a charge other than 1, e.g., carbonate, phosphate, and hydrogen phosphate, can be used instead of anions having a charge of 1, so long as they do not adversely affect the overall activity of the complex. However, using anions having a charge other than 1 will result in a slight modification of the general formula for the complex set forth above. In addition, where a substituent is designated as, or can be, a hydrogen, the exact chemical nature of a substituent which is other than hydrogen at that position, e.g., a hydrocarbyl radical or a halogen, hydroxy, amino and the like functional group, is not critical so long as it does not adversely affect the overall activity and/or synthesis procedure.

In all preparative methods, all starting materials are known or readily preparable from known starting materials. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. EXAMPLES All reagents were used as received unless otherwise indicated. 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-Methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin tetratosylate and Acetato-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin iron(III) were purchased from Porphyrin Products Inc. (Logan, Utah). Iron(III)citrate and iron(III)EDTA complexes were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.). All nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on Varian VXR-300 or Varian VXR-400 spectrometers. Qualitative and quantitative mass spectra were run on a Finnigan MAT90, a Finnigan 4500 and a VG40-250T spectrometers. Example 1Synthesis of Acetato (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphinato) iron (III) tetra-tosylate, Fe(III)TMPyP. 5,10,15,20-Tetra-(N-methyl-pyridyl)porphine tetratosylate, (H2 TMPyP) (0.30 g, 0.231 mmole) was charged to a 100 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and was dissolved in a minimal amount of MeOH. Anhydrous Fe(OAc)2 (0.120 g, 0.692 mmole) was added followed immediately by 25 mL of glacial acetic acid and 100 uL of triethylamine. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux. The reaction was monitored by visible spectroscopy and was determined to be complete with the appearance of a strong band at 426 nm indicative of the metallated porphyrin. The MeOH was removed by evaporation and the solid was taken up again in a minimal amount of MeOH. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum to a total volume of .about.20 mL at which point the unreacted Fe(OAc)2 precipitates. The solid was separated by centrifugation and the mother liquor is chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column (2×30 cm) using MeOH as eluent. The initial colored band was collected and Fe(III)TMPyP(OAc) was isolated by precipitation after evaporation of solvent and trituration with ether to give 85 mg (26%) of the desired product as confirmed by mass spectral analysis. Example 2Synthesis of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-disulfonatedmesityl)porphyrin octasodium salt (H2 TMPS). 5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphyrin (H2 TMP) was prepared by the condensation of pyrrole and mesitaldehyde in sealed glass tubes by the method of Badger (G. M. Badger, R. A. Jones, R. L. Laslett Aust. J. Chem., 17, 1022, [1964]) or in refluxing collidine according to the literature preparation of Meunier (Meunier et. al. Nouv. J. Chim., 10, 39-49, [1986]). Chlorin impurities were removed by oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4,-benzoquinone in refluxing benzene followed by chromatography on basic alumina. Both methods produced nearly identical yields of H2 TMPS. Synthesis of H2 TMPS was achieved using a slight modification of the method of Meunier (Meunier et. al. Inorg. Chem, 31, 1999-2006, [1992]). A 25 mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and stir bar was charged with H2 TMP (1.0 g, 1.28 mmole). Oleum (H2 SO4 +18-23% SO3) 10 mL was added and the reaction was heated to 80° C. for 40 min. The reaction was cooled and its contents was added dropwise to 100 mL of water cooled in an ice bath. The resulting water solution was neutralized with 2N NaOH (.about.220 mL) to a pH=6-7. The water was removed by evaporation and the resulting solid residue was triturated with a minimal amount of MeOH. The resulting precipitate was removed by filtration and the filtrate was further concentrated to 60 mL under vacuum. The resulting precipitate (additional Na2 SO4) was separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness generating 1.59 g (78%) of the desired sulfonated porphyrin. Example 3Synthesis of Acetato 5,10,15,20tetrakis(3,5,disulfonatomesityl)porphyrin Manganese(III) octasodium salt (Mn(III)TMPS). H2 TMPS (0.2 g, 0.125 mmole) and Mn(OAc)2 (0.296 g, 1.71 mmole) was dissolved in 38 mL of water and was heated to 85° C. for 1 h. The reaction was monitored by visible spectroscopy and was determined to be complete when the Soret band (416 nm) of the free base porphyrin was replaced by a new band at 468 nm characteristic of Mn(III) porphyrin species. The reaction was reduced in volume under vacuum to 10 mL and was chromatographed on a Dowex 50WX-8 cation exchange resin (H+ form) to remove excess Mn(OAc)2. The eluent was reduced in volume to 10 mL and was adjusted to pH=8.0 with 1.0 N NaOH. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken up in 7 mL of MeOH and chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column using MeOH as eluent. The purple band was collected and evaporated to dryness giving 0.175 g(90%) of the desired metallated porphyrin as determined by mass spectral analysis. Example 4Synthesis of Acetato-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-disulfonatomesityl)porphyrin Iron (III) octasodium salt (Fe(III)TMPS). H2 TMPS (0.2 g, 0.125 mmole) and Fe(OAc)2 (0.300 g 1.72 mmole) was dissolved in 38 mL of water. The reaction mixture was brought to reflux and was monitored by visible spectroscopy to determine complete metallation. Upon completion the reaction was filtered and reduced in volume to 10 mL. The orange-brown reaction mixture was passed through a Dowex 50WX-8 cation exchange column (H+from) to remove excess Fe(OAc)2. The eluent was reduced in volume to 10 mL and was adjusted to a pH=7.5 with 1.0 N NaOH. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken up in 7 mL of MeOH and chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column using MeOH as eluent. The orange-brown band was evaporated to dryness giving 0.170 g (72%) of the desired Fe porphyin as confirmed by mass spectral analysis. Example 5Synthesis of Acetato-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-disulfonatomesityl)porphyrin Nickel (II) octasodium salt (Ni(II)TMPS). H2 TMPS (0.1 g, 0.063 mmole) and Ni(OAc)2 (0.156 g, 0.63 mmole) was dissolved in 20 mL of water and was refluxed for 3 h. The reaction mixture was orange in color indicative of the Ni porphyrin. The completion of the reaction was confirmed by Vis spectroscopy. The reaction was reduced in volume to 5 mL and chromatographed on a Dowex 50 WX-8 ion exchange column (H+ form) to remove excess Ni(OAc)2. The eluent was reduced in volume to 5 mL and was adjusted to a pH=8.0 with 1.0 N NaOH. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken up in 7 mL of MeOH and chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column using MeOH as eluent. Product was isolated by removal of solvent to give 0.090 g (85%) of the desired metallated porphyrin as confirmed by mass spectral analysis. Example 6Synthesis of N,N'-ethylenebis(3,3'dimethoxysalicylideneamine) ligand. A modification of the procedure of Coleman was used (Coleman et al. Inorg. Chem , 20, 700, [1981]). A 100 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar was charged with 25 mL of absolute EtOH and 3-methoxysalicyladehyde (3.04 g, 0.02 mol). A 20 mL solution of absolute EtOH and ethylenediamine (0.601 g, 0.01 mol) was freshly prepared and was added in one portion to the salicylaldehyde. The reaction was refluxed for 1 h during which time a yellow-orange precipitate appeared. The product was collected by filtration, washed with 100 mL of hot ethanol, and dried under vacuum to give 4.4 g (98%) of the desired product. Example 7Synthesis of Chloro[N,N'-ethylenebis(3,3'-dimethoxysalicylideneaminato)iron (III) N,N'-Ethylenebis(3,3'dimethoxysalicylideneamine) (0.05 g, 0.188 mmole) was dissolved in 20 mL of MeOH and Fe(Cl)3 (0.030 g, 0.188 mmole) was added in one portion. The solution was refluxed for 1 h after which time the solvent was removed under vacuum. The purple residue was washed with a minimal amount of water. The solid was taken up in 10 mL of MeOH, filtered and re-isolated by removal of solvent to give 0.047 g (70%) of the desired iron complex. Example 8Synthesis of 12,14-Dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-11,13-dienatonickel(II) Hexaflorophosphate, Ni(II)([14]dienoN4)PF6 Ni(II)([14]dienoN4)PF6 was prepared by the method of Martin and Cummings (Martin, J. G.; Cummings, S. C. Inorg. Chem., 12, 1477-1482, [1973]). The compound was characterized by mass spectral analysis and was shown to be consistent with the desired structure. Example 9Synthesis of 12,14-Dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-11,14-dienenickel(II) Hexaflorophosphate, Ni(II)([14]dieneN4)(PF6)2 Ni(II)([14]dieneN4)(PF6)2 Ni(II)([14]dieneN4)(PF6)2 was prepared from Ni(II)([14]dienoN4)PF6 by the method of Martin and Cummings ( Martin, J. G.; Cummings, S. C. Inorg. Chem., 12, 1477-1482, [1973]). Example 10Synthesis of 6,8,15,17-Tetramethyldibenzo[b,i][1,4,8,11 tetraazatetradeca-2,4,7,9,12,14-hexaenatonickel(II), Ni(II)[14]12eneN4 Ni(II)[14]12eneN4 was prepared by the method of Goendken et. al. (Goendken et. al. J.C.S. Chem.Comm., 337-338, [1973]). The complex was characterized by mass spectral analysis and which was consistent with the desired structure. Example 11 This example describes the preparation of peroxynitrite stock solutions used in these studies. A modified version of the procedure described by Hughs was used (Hughs, M. N.; Nicklin, H. G. J. Chem. Soc., (A), 450-452, [1968]). To 10 mL of vigorously stirred 0.6 M NaNO2 solution maintained at 0° C. was added an equal volume of a HCl/H2 O2 solution (0.6 M HCl and 0.7 M H2 O2) followed immediately by the rapid addition of 10 mL of 0.75 M NaOH. The resulting yellow solution was treated with 25 mg of MnO2 for 3 min. and was immediately filtered. The filtrate was placed in a -20° C. freezer for several days which resulted in the fractionation of the sodium peroxynitrite as evident by a fine yellow band visible at the top of the flask. The yellow band was collected to yield .about.1 mL of a 280 mM sodium peroxynitrite solution. This solution could be stirred frozen at -20° C. for several days with minimal decomposition of peroxynitrite. Example 12 This example describes the procedures used to determine if compounds are peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst by stopped-flow kinetic analysis. All analysis were run using potassium phosphate buffers (Calbiochem) which were biological grade using ultra pure water prepared by the method of Riley (Riley, D. P. et. al. Anal. Biochem. 196, 344-349, [1991]). Kinetic measurements were made on an OLIS Rapid Scanning Stopped-Flow Spectrometer (On-Line Instrument Systems Inc., Bogart, Ga.)) using the OLISRSM-1000 Operating system for data acquisition and manipulation. Peroxynitrite has a strong absorbance at 302 nm (extinction coefficient =1670 M-1 cm-1) and has been shown to decompose in a process that is first-order in sodium peroxynitrite and first order in protons (Hughs, M. N.; Nicklin, H. G. J. Chem. Soc., (A), 450-452, [1968]) with t1/2 =1.9 sec. at 37° C pH=7.4 (Beckman, J. S. et.al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, 1620-1624, [1990]). Thus, in a typical experiment the natural background decomposition rate of sodium peroxynitrite was determined as follows. A 24 mM stock solution of sodium peroxynitrite in 50 mM NaOH is load into the small volume syringe and 100 mM potassium phosphate pH=7.4 is charged into the large volume syringe of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. All stopped -flow measurements were made at 22 ° C. Injection of the solutions into the sample compartment results in .about.25 fold dilution of the stock sodium peroxynitrite. The decomposition of sodium peroxynitrite is first order in peroxynitrite with a t1/2 =5.2 see and a kobs =1.39×10-1±0.15 sec-1. To test for catalytic peroxynitrite decomposition activity, the metal complex was dissolved in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH=7.4 and loaded into the large syringe and the decomposition of peroxynitrite was monitored as described above. The catalytic rate constant (kcat M-1 sec-1) for the complexes tested was determined by varying the complex concentration and plotting kobs vs [complex] Table 1. The kobs were obtained from averages of three stopped flow analysis at each catalyst concentration. Data representative of this analysis for a variety of compounds is shown in FIG. 1. The simple di and trivalent chloride salts of Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni showed no catalytic peroxynitrite decomposition activity at concentration of 0.050 mM and below.

Stock solutions of bovine liver CuZnSOD (DDI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mountain View CA) were prepared by dissolving -1.0 mg of enzyme in 10 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at a pH=7.4. The activity of this solution to dismutate superoxide was determined by the method of Riley (Riley, D. P. et. al. Anal. Biochem. 196, 344-349, [1991]). All kobs were the average of triplicate runs using a stopped flow spectrophotometer manufactured by Kinetic Instruments Inc. (Ann Arbor, Mich.) and was interfaced to a MAC IICX personal computer.Inactivation of CuZn SOD by peroxynitrite. Inactivation of peroxynitrite was performed by aloquating 1.0 mL of stock CuZn SOD solution into 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH=7.4 such that a final assay volume of 10 mL is achieved after addition of peroxynitrite and EDTA solutions. To these assay solution was added various amounts of peroxynitrite (25 mM stock solution) such that the final concentration of peroxynitrite in the assay varied from 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 uM. After the addition of peroxynitrite, 100 uL of a 2.5 mM stock EDTA solution was added to each assay solution such that the final concentration of EDTA was 250 uM. Each solution was then assayed by stopped flow analysis for superoxide dismutase activity. A plot of kobs vs peroxynitrite concentration is shown in FIG. 2. Control reaction which contained CuZnSOD in the presence of 250 uM EDTA alone and 100 uM potassium nitrite or nitrate showed no decrease in CuZnSOD activity. Example 14Protection of CuZnSOD from inactivation by peroxynitrite using peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts Assay solutions were prepared as described above except for the addition of various of peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst. The final solution volume was maintained at 10 mL. Thus, to the assay solutions Fe(III)TMPyP (0.5 and 1.0 uM final concentration) and Fe(III)TMPS (1.0 and 5.0 uM final concentration) was added. The solution were then treated with various amounts of peroxynitrite such that the final concentrations of 0,25, 50, 75 and 100 uM were achieved. Following treatment with peroxynitrite EDTA was added to a final concentration of 250 uM. The solutions were then assayed for SOD activity. Plots of kobs vs [peroxynitrite] at various catalysts concentrations illustrates the protective effect of Fe(III)TMPyP FIG. 3 and Fe(III)TMPS FIG. 4. Under the assay conditions employed, Fe(III)TMPyP and Fe(II)TMPS were shown not to be effective catalysts for the dismutation of superoxide. Example 15In Vitro Evaluation: Serials: Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) was obtained from Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA. Human recombinant complement C5a and L-arginine (L-arg) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo. Authentic peroxynitrite in 50 mM NaOH was prepared as described above. Isolation of Endothelial Cells: Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDME cells) from neonatal foreskin were prepared as previously described (Marks, R. M., Czerniecki, M., and Penny, R. In Vit. Cell. Devel. Biol., 21, 627-635 [1985]). In brief, neonatal foreskin tissue from several donors was washed in 70% ethanol, cut into small pieces, then emersed in trypsin (0.6%; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif.) and EDTA (1%; Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.) for 7-9 minutes. The endothelial cells were removed by pressing the unkeratinized surface of the tissue with a scalpel blade. The cells were centrifuged through a 35% Percoll density gradient (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). After centrifugation at 250×g for 10 min, cells corresponding to a density of less than 1.048 g/ml were collected and plated onto gelatin coated tissue culture dishes (0.1%; Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). Contaminating cells were weeded daily using a 25 gauge needle mounted onto a tuberculin syringe. Purified endothelial cells were grown to passage 5 (.about.8 population doublings) in MCDB 131 (Endothelial basal medium; Clonetics Corporation) supplemented with 30% human serum (BioWittaker, Inc., Walkersville, Md.), 10 ng/ml EGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, Mass.), 2 mM L-glutamine (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif.), and 250 μg/ml dibutyryl CAMP, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). These cells were characterized as normal endothelial cells by testing for endothelial cell markers (Factor VIII immunoreactivity, cell-associated angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and low density lipoprotein uptake). Cells were cryopreserved at passage 5 in 10% DMSO for use in the subsequent assays after testing negative for mycoplasma (Coriel Institute, Camden, N.J.). Preparation of Neutrophils: Human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors (Look, D. C., Rapp, S. R., Keller, B. T., and Holtzman, M. J. Am. J. Physiol., 263, L79-L87 [1992]). EDTA anti-coagulated blood was separated using a single-step density centrifugation (PMN Prep, Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, Calif.) followed by several washes in Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS; Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.) and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Preparations contained >95% neutrophils and were >95% viable by trypan blue (GIBCO Laboratories, Grand Island N.Y.) exclusion. Purified neutrophils were suspended in HBSS supplemented with 0.01% BSA (Miles, Inc., Kankakee, Ill.) and 300 uM L-arg (HBSSBA) at a concentration of 5×106 cells/ml. Endothelial Cell Injury Assays: The cytotoxic effects of stimulated neutrophils or peroxynitrite on endothelial cells was determined using a 51 Cr-release assay as described by Moldow (Moldow et. al. Methods Enzymol., 105, 378-385, [1984]). Passage 5 HDME cells were grown to a density of .about.1-2×104 cells/cm2 (.about.90% confluence) in 96 well microtiter plates and labeled for 18 h with 10 uCi/ml sodium [51 Cr]chromate (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, Ill.). The HDME cells were cytokine-activated for 4 h with 100 U/ml human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a; Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, Mass.), then washed twice with HBSSBA. Suspensions of neutrophils were added at a concentration of 2.5×105 /well and allowed to settle for 15 min. Unless otherwise noted, the neutrophils were activated by priming with 25 U/ml TNF-a for 10 min followed by activation with 3 μg/ml complement component C5a (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). Incubations were continued for 2 h at 37° C. When authentic peroxynitrite was used, it was added in the absence of neutrophils. Peroxynitrite was added directly to the HDME cell layer from a 25 mM stock in 50 mM NaOH giving a final concentration from 0-800 uM. All inhibitors were made fresh immediately prior to the assay in HBSSBA and added as 1/10 of the well volume before peroxynitrite addition or neutrophil activation. 51 Cr release was determined by aspiration of the supernatant from each well (soluble fraction). The monolayers were washed gently with HBSSBA to remove non-adherent cells and the washes pooled with the soluble fraction. The adherent cells from each well were solubilized with 1 N NaOH and removed to a separate tube. Both fractions were analyzed by gamma scintillation spectrometry. Results were expressed as percent 51 Cr release as follows: % release=cpm (soluble+nonadherent/total cpm per well)×100. Specific cytotoxicity reflects the difference between 51 Cr release induced by stimulated neutrophils and unstimulated neutrophils (typically 1-2% above spontaneous release). Results were confirmed in 2-3 separate assays and the data presented are representative. As can be seen from FIG. 5, addition of peroxynitrite to endothelial cells results in a dose dependent increase in cell injury demonstrating the cytotoxic effects of peroxynitrite. Complexes which have been shown to be peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts by stopped flow analysis are capable of protecting against peroxynitrite mediated cell injury FIG. 6. These complexes are also capable of protecting against neutrophil mediated cell injury in a dose dependant fashion FIG. 7. Example 16 Protocol for Cell Protection Assays using Peroxynitrite Decomposition Catalysts: A cell viability assay was established to rapidly assess the efficacy of peroxynitrite(PN) catalysts in protecting cells from PN25 mediated injury and death. The peroxynitrite challenge consisted of a pulse of synthetic PN added exogenously to cells. In order to better assess the efficacy of PN catalysts in protecting cells from PN-mediated damage, a quantity of peroxynitrite(in 50 mM NaOH) determined to cause maximal injury(100%) was added as an exogenous pulse to each well of cells in the presence or absence of catalyst. The NaOH vehicle was not toxic by itself. Cells(RAW 264.7 cells or P815 mastocytoma cells; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.) were plated to confluence on 96-well tissue culture plates. Each well is washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline(DPBS; GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.) to remove protein and other serum components which might react with the exogenous peroxynitrite. To each well is then added 200 μl of DPBS. PN is next placed into separate wells at increasing concentrations and cell viability monitored. The dose at which maximal cell death is attained is then utilized for the catalyst protection assessment. Phosphate-buffered saline (200 uL) containing increasing concentrations of catalyst is next placed into individual wells of cells. The maximal dose of PN is subsequently administered to all wells of cells. After 15 minutes, the medium is removed from each well and the cells are either allowed to recover overnight in Earles minimum essential medium without phenol red and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or alternatively the plate of cells is assayed that day for mitochondrial integrity using the Alamar Blue viability assay(Alamar Biosciences, Inc.; Sacramento, Calif.). In either case, cells are incubated at 37° C. in 5% CO2. Cell injury is measured as follows. Briefly, 10% Alamar Blue(v/v) in Earles MEM with 10% FBS is added to each well of cells for 1-2h. Cell metabolism of the dye generates a fluorescent product which is directly related to the number of viable cells. Moreover, the production of the fluorescent metabolite is linear for over 2 h. The amount of fluorescent product in 100 μl of conditioned medium from each well of cells is then measured with an IDEXX fluorescent plate reader (gain setting of 1%) at an emission wavelength of 575 nm after exciting at 545 nm. Viability is either given as absolute fluorescent units or as a percent of the value obtained for untreated cells(100%). As can be seen in FIG. 8, both Fe- and Ni- coordinated catalysts were able to protect the murine monocyte-macrophage line RAW 264.7; in this experiment PN was added at a dose causing a 50% decrease in cell viability. Comparison of increasing PN doses on RAW and P815 cells showed no evidence for a differential susceptibility to peroxynitrite-mediated injury(data not shown). However, as shown in FIG. 9, there is a significant protection of cells by Fe-TMPyP, FeTMPS, and FeTPPS while H2 TMPyP and ZnTMPyP were relatively ineffective (data not shown), a result consistent with their lack of catalytic potency. Addition of catalyst after PN was unable to rescue the cells from injury (data not shown) indicating the ability of the catalysts to protect cells directly from oxidative damage due to PN. Example 17In vivo Evaluation: Carrageenan-induced paw edema. The effects of peroxynitrite catalysts in vivo were initially tested on the carrageenan-induced paw edema. The choice of using this in vivo model of inflammation was based on the knowledge that 1) the inflammatory response is blocked by NOS inhibitors and 2) by superoxide dismutase (SOD). This indicates the participation of both NO and of O2-. Male Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, Ind.). Male Sprague Dawley rats (175-200 g) received a subplantar injection in the right hind paw of carrageenan (0.1 ml of a 1% suspension in 0.85% saline). Paw volume was measured by a plethysmometer immediately before the injection of carrageenan and then at hourly intervals from 1 to 6 h. Edema was expressed as the increase in paw volume (in ml) measured after carrageenan injection compared to the pre-injection value for individual animals. Rats were given a bolus i.v. injection of active or inactive peroxynitrite catalysts 1 hour after the intraplantar injection of carrageenan; paw swelling was assessed thereafter every hour for up to 6 h. The relative % inhibition obtained with these agents is summarized in Table 2. Under these experimental conditions the inactive peroxynitrite catalysts H2 TMPS, ZnTMPyP or MnTPPS (all given at 30 mg/kg) or FeCl3 (5 mg/kg, n=6) failed to inhibit edema formation.

Each point is the mean ± s.e.m for n = 6 animals. Induction of intestinal damage by endotoxin in the rat: Multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) that develops following the septic attack is in most cases fatal. The "motor" of MOFS is the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the small intestine. Extensive ischaemia may be found in the intestinal mucosa due to profound vasoconstriction. Ischaemia and hypoxia result in mucous lesions, found both in animals (rat, cat, dogs) and humans. The origin of the mucous lesion is hypoxia. During reperfusion (e.g, after the initial severe vasoconstriction), O2- may be liberated and play an important role in the pathogensis of mucous lesions in the GI tract. Intestinal damage that results from shock induced by sphlanchnic artery occlusion is prevented by superoxide dismutase and LPS induced intestinal inflammation is inhibited by non-selective inhibitors of the nitric oxide pathway (Boughton-Smith, N. K et al., 1993). There is now substantial experimental and clinical evidence that suggests that excessive NO production has an important pathological role in the hypotension, hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstictors and the cardiovascular collapse associated with septic shock. Furthermore, nitric oxide synthase inhibitors prevent against the intestinal damage caused by endotoxin. We have developed a model of intestinal injury in rats by endotoxin and assessed the effects of therapeutic administration of peroxynitrite catalysts. Intestinal vascular permeability was determined as the leakage into the jejunal tissue of [125 I]-labelled bovine serum albumin ([125 ]-BSA) administered intravenously (0.5 ml; 0.5 μCi) together with either LPS (3 mg/kg, serotype O111:B4) or isotonic saline. At 4 h after LPS administration, segments of jejunal tissue were ligated and removed. The intestinal tissues were rapidly washed, blotted dry and weighed. Blood (0.5 ml) was collected into tubes containing tri-sodium citrate (0.318% final concentration) and plasma prepared by centrifugation (10,000 g×10 min). The {125 I]-BSA content in segments of whole tissue and in aliquots of plasma (100 μl) was determined in a gamma counter. The total content of plasma in the intestinal tissues was expressed as μl/g tissue. Changes in intravascular volume in the intestinal tissue was determined in an additional group of rats by administering ([125 I]-BSA) intravenously 2 min before removal of the jejunum. The tissue and plasma content of radiolabel was determined and intravascular volume expressed as μl/g tissue. This value was substracted from that obtained in the plasma leakage studies to obtain a measure of the intestinal plasma albumin leakage. After LPS administration (4 h), there was a significant (P<0.01) increase in the plasma leakage (from 77±10 to 224±18 μl/g tissue, n=8). Administration of FeTMPS or FeTMPyP (30 mg/kg, i.v, n=4), 3 h after LPS injection, caused a reduction in radiolabelled albumin leakage determined 1 h later, as shown in FIG. 10. In contrast, administration of the inactive peroxynitrite catalyst ZnTMPyP (30 mg/kg, i.v, n=4), 3 h after LPS injection, did not inhibit radiolabelled albumin leakage determined 1 h later (FIG. 10). This data was supported by histological examination of the jejunal tissues. When compared to saline treated rats, LPS evoked profound jejunal damage with severe disruption of plicae and villi. LPS-induced damage was less severe in jejunums taken from rats treated with FeTMPS or FeTMPyP (30 mg/kg, i.v.). Thus, the compounds which are compounds or complexes of the present invention are novel and can be utilized to treat numerous inflammatory disease states and disorders. For example, reperfusion injury to an ischemic organ, e.g., reperfusion injury to the ischemic myocardium, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, hypertension, psoriasis, organ transplant rejections, organ preservation, impotence, radiation-induced injury, asthma, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, platelet aggregation, side effects from drug treatment of cancer metastasis, influenza, stroke, burns, trauma, acute pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, hepatitis, autoimmune diseases, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, disseminated intravascular coagulation, fatty embolism, adult and infantile respiratory distress, and hemorrhages in neonates. Patients receiving IL-2 therapy often develop potentially life-threatening side effects that include fever, chills, hypotension, capillary leak syndrome, as well as evidence of multiple organ dysfunction, specifically including renal insufficiency and cholestatic jaundice. IL-2 induces a complex network of cytokines that include tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 and 6. Therefore, IL-2-treated patients resemble patients with endotoxemia (hypotension, elevated TNF levels, elevated cytokine levels etc). Some of these induce release of free radicals as well as inducing iNOS with subsequent release of NO. A recent paper shows that iNOS is induced in patients that receive IL-2 for treatment of renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma (Hibbs, J. B. et al., Evidence for cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthesis from L-arginine in patients receiving interleukin-2 therapy. J. Clin. Invest. Vol 89, 867-877). Activity of the compounds or complexes of the present invention for protecting superoxide dismutase can be demonstrated using the stopped-flow kinetic described above. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis is an accurate and direct method for quantitatively monitoring the decay rates of peroxynitrite in water. The stopped-flow kinetic analysis is suitable for screening complexes for catalytic peroxynitrite decomposition activity and active complexes of the present invention, as identified by stopped-flow analysis, are shown to correlate to treating the above disease states and disorders. In other words, the present invention is for the methods and compositions for the treatment of a disease or condition advantageously affected by decomposition of peroxynitrite which is accelerated over a natural background rate of decay, preferably in humans suffering from such disease or condition, which comprises administering a metal complex, in dosage unit form, of accelerated-rate-effective amounts for decomposing peroxynitrite preferably wherein the metal complex is as defined above. Such methods or compositions accomplish the treatment of these diseases without disadvantageously affecting normal biologically advantageous mechanisms. Total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, from about 1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight daily and more usually about 3 to 30 mg/kg. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The number of submultiples is preferably about one to three times per day of about 30 mg/kg per unit dosage form. The serum concentrations of the doses are about 15 μM to 1.5 mM with preferred ranges of 3 to 300 μM. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors, including the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized and whether the compound is administered as part of a drug combination. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from the preferred dosage regimen set forth above. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug. Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, granules and gels. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. While the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more compounds of the present invention or with one or more compounds which are known to be effective against the specific disease state that one is targeting for treatment.

Method of improving yield and vigor of plants



Patent number:  7687434
                                            

Abstract:  A method of improving the yield and vigor of agronomic plants, in particular leguminous plants such as soybeans, involves treating such plants and/or the propagation material of plants with a composition that includes an active agent, such as a fungicide, that has no significant activity against fungal plant pathogens of the treated plant. When the plant is not wheat, a preferred agent of this type is 4,5-dimethyl-N-(2-propenyl)-2-(trimethylsilyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide (silthiofam). Plants and plant propagation material, such as seeds, that have been treated by the novel method are also described.

Method of improving yield and vigor of plants



Publication number:  20030114308
                                            

Abstract:  A method of improving the yield and vigor of agronomic plants, in particular leguminous plants such as soybeans, involves treating such plants and/or the propagation material of plants with a composition that includes an active agent, such as a fungicide, that has no significant activity against fungal plant pathogens of the treated plant. When the plant is not wheat, a preferred agent of this type is 4,5-dimethyl-N-(2-propenyl)-2-(trimethylsilyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide (silthiofam). Plants and plant propagation material, such as seeds, that have been treated by the novel method are also described.

Patent number:  6278017
                                            

Abstract:  A process for the continuous production of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is provided. In the process, N-(acetyl)iminodiacetic acid is formed in an amidocarboxymethylation reactor system. The N-(acetyl)iminodiacetic acid product stream is either: (1) reacted with a source of phosphorous and a source of formaldehyde in the presence of an acid to form a phosphonomethylation reaction product stream containing N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid and acetic acid; or (2) deacylated and cyclized to form a 2,5-diketopiperazine, and then reacted with a source of phosphorous and a source of formaldehyde in the presence of an acid to form a phosphonomethylation reaction product stream containing N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid and acetic acid. In either case, the N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid product is recovered and converted to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine.

Patent number:  6130351
                                            

Abstract:  A process for the production of N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid. N-(acetyl)iminodiacetic acid is formed in a amidocarboxymethylation reactor system, into which a source of each of the following is continuously fed: (1) acetamide or an acetamide derivative, (2) formaldehyde or a formaldehyde generator or derivative, (3) a carbonylation catalyst, (4) carbon monoxide, and optionally (5) hydrogen. In turn, an amidocarboxymethylation reaction product stream, which contains N-(acetyl)iminodiacetic acid and the carbonylation catalyst, is withdrawn from the amidocarboxymethylation reactor system. The carbonylation catalyst is separated from the amidocarboxymethylation reaction product stream to recover the carbonylation catalyst and form a catalyst depleted product stream which contains N-(acetyl)iminodiacetic acid.
