Castle Holding Corp...





The Company



is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Nevada in 1986. The Company ticker symbol is CHOD.









The Company

 
has come under new control and intends to move forward with a new vision. That 
vision is expected to include:


Acquiring positions in growing companies, whether public or private, to 
increase the net asset value of the Company.
Developing subsidiaries of the Company to increase consolidated income of the 
Company.
To spin out as a dividend to Company shareholders registered and/or 
unregistered shares of other companies that have merit. This would aid those 
other companies to enter the public trading market to provide the ability for 
those companies to more easily raise capital and/or have an exit strategy.
As a direct benefit of vision number 3, the Company intends to retain a 
certain percent of equity in each spinout dividend that would be accomplished. 
This would not only be directed to increase the net asset value of the Company, 
but also potentially provide capital gains for the Company.
 Management consulting for companies and individuals seeking a strategy or 
strategic partner.

In this development stage period, the Company is open to obtain feedback from 
entrepreneurs, investors and companies desiring our assistance as well as any 
other relevant ideas. To do so simply complete the Contact 
Us form. Our website is continually being developed and updated, so please 
check back from time to time.

Be advised that nothing expressed on this website is intended to be a

Summary of Corporate Activities





Corporate Activities


From November 2014 the Company has been under constant development. These 
efforts have resulted in laying the groundwork for future potentially successful 
ventures under the guidance of the Company holding corporation management 
guidance.

A brief outline follows:

1. In 2015 the Company launched its SAS Health and Beauty Subsidiary activities. 
This first effort led to the development of a facial lift spray that, in our 
opinion acts like Botox(R) for a day. (Botox is a Registered Trademark of 
Allergan). In addition, the product we now call SAS Facial Lift Spray has been 
demonstrated by test users to have long term positive facial benefits when used 
daily. It continues to be test marketed at
http://www.sasmlm.com Our 
goal is to continue to gather user data, dynamically repackage the product and 
eventually offer it on a large scale through a product Infomercial. The Company 
believes this is a potential market in excess of $100,000,000. Once properly 
funded, the Company is expecting to pursue this goal.

2. A second business venture subsidiary in which the company has established for 
a goal is to enter into venture capital funding as well as help boot strap start 
up companies with projects that appear to have successful merits. In line with 
that effort the Company created

http://sharkventurecapital.com in 2016. Shark Venture Capital produced a 
half dozen pilot shows and plans to further develop the concept when proper 
funding becomes available.

3. A third project which the Company believes will add a further revenue stream 
is Castle Royalties Corp. (CRP). CRP controls eight patents related to fields 
such as weight loss, increasing adult stem cells a the bodys natural renewal 
system and products designed to assist in extending human longevity in healthful 
and natural ways. These patents are exclusively licensed to SAS Health and 
Beauty Corp (SAS). and marketed through another division of SAS as outlined in 
the information that follows. CRP also will license these products on a non 
exclusive basis to other companies who brand the products differently in a way 
as not to compete with SAS. The Company believes that over time, these royalties 
have the potential to become substantial.

4. The most recent project launched by the Company this past year through its 
SAS subsidiary is http://jdimlm.com 
We believe we have the ability to be the leader in this space under the 
following concept: As we age, the body releases fewer and fewer ADULT STEM CELLS 
which are the bodys rebuilding tools. STEM CELL NUTRITION helps overcome the 
Ageing Process by promoting the release of additional ADULT STEM CELLS in the 
body. Our products are oriented to this theme and our website has been 
attracting new distributors daily. We are licensed through CRP and believe we 
are the only marketer offering such patent protected patents that are combined 
with a daily vitamin that a major portion of populations in the USA and abroad 
need.

The above outline is simply a sketch of where we are as well as offering the 
concept of how we intend to build the Company. We intend to both make our 
projects self funding over the long haul and raise additional capital to further 
advance our Company goals in an organized and successful way.

(CHOD) (the "Company") is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary SAS Health and Beauty Corp. ("SAS") is ready to begin the launch of a new facial product that SAS and the Company believe will change how people view their facial skin care.SAS specializes in developing and marketing proprietary regenerative products based upon advanced peptides that can give a Botox(R) type effect and also provide other beneficial facial appearance affects. The US Department of Health and Human Services calls regenerative medicine the "next evolution." The regenerative market, which includes cosmeceuticals, nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals, was estimated at $7.2 Billion in the US in 2014 and is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years according to a business consultancy service report. SAS's exclusive products combine its in-house advancements, proprietary technologies, and soon to be patent pending formulations. The Company's goal is to leverage its knowledge and expertise to develop age defying cosmeceutical skincare and hair care products in addition to pharmaceutical products based on a regenerative science platform. The Company's first product to be launched is SAS Flower of Youth(TM) Facial Lift Spray. The next products in the pipeline are a Neck Sculpting Cream and a topical Erectile Dysfunction product.SAS will approach the market place with multiple channels of distribution in mind. It will begin with network marketing as presented on this beta website that is 100% functional: http://sasmlm.com.Plans are also in place for distribution through Beauty Salon outlets, big box stores, TV shopping networks, infomercials, foreign outlets and any other reachable distribution channel.Botox(R) is a Registered Trademark of AllerganAbout the CompanyCastle Holding Corp. (the "Company") has an objective to increase visibility of the Company as well as to formulate a plan of action to build the Company into a leading edge merger and acquisition model. That model could take the form of improvement that is currently employed by a publicly owned holding company investment manager like Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. Another possible improved model could be in the bettering of a business development corporation format like Main Street Capital Corporation.This press release contains certain "forward-looking" statements, defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Statements, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. The company, through its management, makes forward-looking public statements concerning its expected future operations, performance and other developments. Such forward-looking statements are estimates reflecting the Company's best judgment based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that other factors will not affect the accuracy of such forward-looking statements. It is impossible to identify all such factors, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the Company.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL  Castle Holding Corp. ("CHC") is a holding company which was incorporated in Nevada on June 13, 1986. On September 30, 1987, CHC acquired Castle Securities Corp., a New York corporation which operated as a securities broker dealer from November 1, 1985 to October 31, 2003. On April 11, 1991, CHC formed Church Street Securities Corp., a New York corporation which operated as a securities broker dealer from October 26, 1995 to January 6, 2005. Since January 2005, CHC and its subsidiaries have had minimal business operations and operating revenues.  Commencing July 2015, CHC's subsidiary SAS Health and Beauty Corp. has engaged in the production and sales of a skin care product called SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Three Months ended December 31, 2015 compared to Three Months ended December 31, 2014.  Sales increased $4,779 from $0 in 2014 to $4,779 in 2015 (all from sales of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray product, which was launched in July 2015).  Cost of sales increased $761 from $0 in 2014 to $761 in 2015 (all from sales of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray).  Gross profit increased $4,018 from $0 in 2014 to $4,018 in 2015 (all from sales of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray). The gross profit percentage of sales in 2015 was approximately 84%.  Total operating expenses increased $31,135 from $2,205 in 2014 to $33,340 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to $20,000 of consulting fees incurred in 2015 relating to a Financial Public Relations Agreement executed in November 2015 and $8,458 of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our subsidiary SAS Health and Beauty Corp. primarily in connection with the launch of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray product.  Other expense - net decreased $19,587 from $40,745 in 2014 to $21,158 in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the $58,725 improvement in net gain (loss) on marketable securities from a loss of $47,705 in 2014 to a gain of $11,020 in 2015, offset by a $40,000 expense recognized in 2015 from impairment of our investment in Emergent Health Corporation common stock. For both periods, substantially all of the marketable securities were invested in TAXI common stock which price per share increased from $7.58 at September 30, 2015 to $7.96 at December 31, 2015.  Net loss increased $7,530 from $42,950 in 2014 to $50,480 in 2015. The increase was due to the $31,135 increase in operating expenses, offset partially by the $4,018 increase in gross profit and the $19,587 decrease in other expense - net.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $45,224, total assets of $429,464, total liabilities of $19,298, and total stockholders' equity of $410,166. Of the $429,464 total assets at December 31, 2015, $230,840 represents the quoted value of 29,000 shares TAXI common stock and $120,000 represents the carrying value of 2,000,000 restricted shares of Emergent Health Corporation (EMGE) common stock.  Cash and cash equivalents decreased $20,745 from $65,969 at September 30, 2015 to $45,224 at December 31, 2015. The $20,745 decrease was due primarily to the $50,480 net loss and the $11,020 increase in marketable securities, offset partially by the $40,000 non-cash impairment of investment in Emergent Health Corporation common stock.  The Company currently has no other agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.  We currently have no commitments with any person for any capital expenditures.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  Since year ended September 30, 2002, Castle Holding Corp. has had no principal accountant. Accordingly, there has been no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.  Jan 25, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
