Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

Amazon.com Review


The most experienced professionals in any field are the first ones to say there is always more to learn. Often, the best way to learn is to be a fly on the wall while watching a peer. Chris and Trish Meyer have given After Effects users a unique and wonderful opportunity in After Effects in Production, allowing us to look over the shoulders of some of the best motion-graphics designers in the business and watch and learn as they go through the creative process. Unlike the fly on the wall, though, we have the chance to occasionally put down the book and practice what's been learned.In the tutorials section, the authors break down the process of creating broadcast-quality motion graphics into a dozen step-by-step tutorials. Each tutorial focuses on or introduces a particular feature, and often builds on features that were introduced in a previous tutorial. The enclosed CD-ROM includes all 12 project and media files (and the final rendered movies), giving the reader the chance to build the project from scratch or carefully dissect a project that's already built.Case Studies, a far smaller section of the book (but equal in value to the rest), explores, breaks down, and dissects After Effects projects that are on the air or on the Web, including work from such studios as Belief, ATTIK, and Curious Pictures. While less step-by-step oriented, one gets the chance to learn why each project was handled the way it was, rather than how.As an added bonus, the CD-ROM includes numerous free plug-ins from such vendors as Pinnacle, Media 100, Boris, Trapcode, and the Foundry for both Mac and Windows versions of After Effects. There's also plenty of bonus material to read and sift through in the form of PDF files--additional tutorials, tips and tricks, and project templates.After Effects in Production is a must-have book for any user who intends to grow into a serious designer, or for the serious designer who simply intends to keep on growing. --Mike Caputo

"If you want to have a career in motion graphics, these books are the best investment you can make."  -- S.D. Katz, millimeter magazine, February 2003Overall, these books are fantastic and as far as Im concerned they should come in the box with After Effects. -- Adrian Thompson, CGFocus.com, on the Meyers' three After Effects titles

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFun learnByStephen Slocombon January 16, 2002Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI found this book with its accompanying CD to be a killer combo. The exercises are fun,but thorough. I heartily recommend it to anyone who has gone through their previous book Creating Motion Graphics, and wants to learn more. I had trouble installing one of the free plugins included on the CD and emailed the authors-they responded the same day with the answer to what I was doing wrong!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsByFejotitaon November 26, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseLove it!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsVery good, if badly writtenByA customeron July 15, 2003Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAny regular reader of DV magazine will be familiar with the columns from Trish and Chris Meyer. There is no question that they are about as knowledgeable about After Effects as two people can be. The only reason I give this book a less-than-stellar review is that it (like the other two After Effects books in this series) is pretty badly written.This is a common failing for computer how-to books. In order to justify obscene pricing, publishers pad the books with folksy commentary. At best, it's condescending. At worst, it actually obscures the facts about the software that the reader is trying to learn.That said, and taking into account the ridiculous prices, these books are just about the best available for After Effects.One last consideration: If you're prepared to wade through the material, many of the tidbits in these books may actually be archived on DV magazine's web site.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWhat a Way To Learn!BySteven Aon May 8, 2002Format: PaperbackI have been studying computer Graphics and editing for years with books, CD's, tapes and professional classes and within minutes of working with The Myers' "After Effects In Production" I knew I had stumbled upon a true find! I have not even completed the book and felt compelled to write this. The organization of their tutorials both logically and graphically are without peer.  I have spent literally hundreds of dollars on video tapes and there is a method to their teaching style that is so much more powerful and intuitive that I found myself not only picking up important tips, but more importantly retaining them through repitition.  The included CD comes with terrific extras and great articles that will truly advance your overall understanding of Motion Graphics.  I am confidant that my expertise as an After Effects Artist will be beyond my wildest dreams by the time I finish their book.  You must buy this book if you want to let your creative juices really go wild.Read more0Comment|

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
