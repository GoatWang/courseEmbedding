Coal Lease News From The Coal Fields™
Learn more about the Bureau of Land Management, Public Land Survey System, and coal leases.





Understanding Lease Ownership

We receive lots of emails from people who find their name or a relative’s name on our site and want to know if this means they have some right to the land listed under that name.




Understanding BLM Administrative Areas

Wether it is filing a lease or researching one, the administering BLM office is going to be the definitive source.




Understanding Location Data

Lease handled by the Bureau of Land Management are not mapped by latitude and longitude, instead, these leases harken back to the Public Land Survey System.




Understanding Townships

A “township” can refer to two different things. Both are part of the PLSS measurement system but have different uses.

Coal Lease News From The Coal Fields™
Learn more about the Bureau of Land Management, Public Land Survey System, and coal leases.





Understanding Lease Ownership

We receive lots of emails from people who find their name or a relative’s name on our site and want to know if this means they have some right to the land listed under that name.




Understanding BLM Administrative Areas

Wether it is filing a lease or researching one, the administering BLM office is going to be the definitive source.




Understanding Location Data

Lease handled by the Bureau of Land Management are not mapped by latitude and longitude, instead, these leases harken back to the Public Land Survey System.




Understanding Townships

A “township” can refer to two different things. Both are part of the PLSS measurement system but have different uses.
