London, the centre of our European business


Nearly 25% of our employees are based in our London office, which has a small-office atmosphere within the infrastructure and support of a larger firm.


20 Fenchurch Street | London, EC3M 3BY | United Kingdom | +44 (0)20 3787 3200 



Location
Our office is high up in the building at 20 Fenchurch Street (the ‘Walkie Talkie’), which also hosts the Sky Garden, London’s highest public garden. We overlook the Square Mile and have amazing 360 degree views. There are many great markets, bars and restaurants within walking distance of the office.





Atmosphere
The office is casual and friendly. Our trading floor is open-plan and surrounded by spaces for discussions, meetings or quiet thinking. At the end of the day, you’ll often find people in the games area or playing board games. We also organise frequent dinners and social events.





Amenities
Breakfast and lunch are catered by our onsite chef and our kitchens are kept well-stocked with snacks (both healthy and less-so). Our games area includes pool, ping-pong and fußball tables and we have two classrooms for internal training and external speakers. The office is new and while our gym is under construction, we have access to nearby gym facilities. We also offer private spaces, including a mother’s room.

Paths with
purpose


Any of Jane Street’s main career paths can be pursued in New York, London, or Hong Kong.


Quantitative Trading
Technology
Quantitative Research
Infrastructure




Quantitative Trading
Traders work in teams to seek out and take advantage of pricing inefficiencies, develop models, manage risk, investigate new products, and push into new business areas. Experienced traders mentor newer colleagues, whose responsibilities increase with their capability.





Ideal candidates will be:

Excellent quantitatively, with a strong understanding of probability and statistics
Effective communicators in close-knit team settings
Motivated, competitive, and eager to learn and teach
Excited to engage in impromptu and exploratory debate on trading strategy and risk






Previous experience or coursework in finance, business, or economics is not required. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you know.





View Open Quantitative Trading Positions
					  














Technology


The technology group is actively hiring in multiple different areas. For all of these, no previous experience or coursework in finance, business, or economics is required. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you already know.






Software Development
The software development team works closely with the rest of the firm, building tools, exploring trading ideas, and designing and maintaining the firm’s software systems.




For dev roles, you should have:

Top-notch programming skills, with an interest in (but not necessarily experience with) functional programming languages.
Deep experience with—and love for—technology. There’s no specific checklist; we use software to attack a variety of problems, so we’re interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design.
Strong interpersonal skills. Software development at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams.
A commitment to the practical. We produce production software on a continuous basis, affecting day-to-day operations in every area of the firm.






Information Technology
and Networking
This group builds and maintains the firm’s technological nervous system. Group members keep our networks fast and robust, manage counterparty connectivity, and provide the glue to hold together the firm’s far-flung activities.




For information technology and networking roles, you should have:

A love for automation. We don’t like solving the same problem manually over and over, and we generally try to program our way out of it.
A careful approach. The systems we manage trade billions of dollars a day, so the stakes are high. We need people who can make quick decisions when necessary, but at the same time maintain a sense of humility about the limits of their own knowledge.
Strong interpersonal skills. Jane Street is a highly collaborative place, and we are looking for people who can work effectively with people across the firm.

Quantitative Research


Researchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software developer roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.






Researchers at Jane Street care about:

Deploying the right tool (mathematical, statistical, computational) for the job. We see ourselves as generalists.
Writing quality production-level code. Researchers spend most of their day writing code.
Thinking and communicating precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm.
Having a real impact on the firm by always striving to keep our work relevant.






We’re looking for:

An ability to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.
A desire to write great code, mostly in OCaml. You don’t need functional programming experience, but you should want to learn.
Good taste in quantitative research. The problems we work on rarely have clean definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose.
Smart and curious people–previous experience or coursework in finance, business, or economics is not required. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you know.

Infrastructure


Our infrastructure areas are key to the firm’s success. Roles in these areas offer endless opportunities to contribute directly and tangibly to our business. Everyone at Jane Street sits together on one trading floor, collaborating closely with each other to ensure that the firm’s critical functions operate efficiently while at the same time being constantly improved.





The specific skill set for each infrastructure position varies, but all include strong organizational, interpersonal and communication skills, detail orientation, and the desire to work in a team-based environment.





Positions include:

Business Development: documenting and solving problems related to the implementation of complex trading strategies within regulatory rules and under operational and technological constraints
Operations: P&L reconciliation, clearing & settlements (some other financial institutions describe this as back office)
Finance: accounting, regulatory capital finance, accounts payable/receivable
Tax
Human Resources
Recruiting
Legal & Compliance
Office Administration

Solution


Show me the answer

\(\def\V{\mathrm{Var}}\)
    Overview: the self-symmetry of the Sierpinski triangle leads to a linear equation that the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) must satisfy; specifically,
      \(\Sigma = \tfrac{1}{4}\Sigma + \tfrac{1}{24}I\), which gives
    \(\fbox{\(\Sigma = \tfrac{1}{18}I\)}\).  
      

    Without rigorously defining the uniform distribution over the
    Sierpinski triangle, we can at least recognize that there are
    certain properties it should have.  The first relevant property is
    that it's invariant under rotation by 120°;
    it follows that \(\Sigma = kI\) for some \(k\).  (Consider:
    The ellipse \(\mathbf{x}^*\Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{x} = 1\) will be invariant under this
    rotation, and the only ellipses invariant under this rotation
    are circles.)  We have \(k = \Sigma_{11} = \V(X_1)\), so we
    have reduced the problem to finding \(\V(X_1)\).
    

      The next relevant property of the distribution is that it's
      equal to a mixture of 3 equally weighted copies of itself, with
      each copy scaled by 1/2 and translated by
      \((1/4,\text{something}),(-1/4,\text{something})\), or
      \((0,\text{something})\).  (The somethings are respectively
      \(-\sqrt{3}/12,-\sqrt{3}/12,\sqrt{3}/6\), but we don't need
      them.)  In particular, if \(T\) is uniform over
      \(\{-1/4,0,1/4\}\) (and independent of \(X_1\)), then \(X_1\)
      has the same distribution as \(\tfrac{1}{2}X_1 + T\).  We can
      directly compute \(\V(T) = 1/24\), and we then have
      \[
      \begin{align}
      k = \V(X_1) &= \V(\tfrac{1}{2}X_1 + T)\\
      &= \tfrac{1}{4}\V(X_1) + \V(T)\\
      &= \tfrac{1}{4}k + 1/24,
      \end{align}
      \]
      and solving for \(k\) now yields \(k = 1/18\), so \(\Sigma = \tfrac{1}{18}I\).
    
A similar approach is to write \(X_1 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
      \frac{1}{2^n}T_n\) where the \(T_n\) are independent copies of \(T\).
      Then \(\V(X_1) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \V(\frac{1}{2^n}T_n) =
      \frac{1}{24} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^n} = 1/18\).

Work where
your mind matters


Jane Street’s internships offer an exceptional opportunity to learn about the firm and the world’s financial markets.






Insight
While proximity to graduation is an advantage, we hire students of all tenure, from freshmen to post-doctoral scholars.
Internships take place in all three of Jane Street’s offices. Most summer interns also get a chance to visit a foreign office during their experience.
Past interns have reported that the best part of the internship is the rich educational experience. Every week brings a mix of finance theory and technology classes, mock trading sessions, and guest speakers, on top of careful one-on-one mentoring with experienced traders and technologists.











Internships We Offer


All of our offices follow a slightly different internship schedule, but no matter where you’re based we will always do our best to work around your academic commitments.
Typically our summer internships run for 10-12 weeks between May and September. Our winter internships vary a bit more office to office. New York offers a one month winternship during January, while London and Hong Kong have longer winternship programs (usually 10-16 weeks) that run between November and May. For Australasia students, we have a summer internship program in Hong Kong which takes place from late November to late February.
These schedules are flexible, so if this timing isn’t exactly what you had in mind, don’t worry; we can work out the details later. You’ll also notice that we have an off-cycle internship application for our London and Hong Kong offices. If you’re not exactly sure what to apply for, selecting this option will allow you to specify your exact availability. We can help you sort it out from there.





Trading Interns
Work with experienced traders to find and analyze arbitrage strategies, hedge risk, and search for new opportunities. Trading interns usually split their summer between two different trading desks, and spend a week in one of our overseas offices.

Business Development Interns
Work with our business development, compliance, and operations teams to understand the regulatory and operational frameworks of various financial markets, and how they impact the implementation of the firm’s systems, processes, and trading strategies.  Business development interns rotate through projects and mentors over the summer, and spend a week in our London office.




Apply Here





Developer Interns
Work with experienced dev mentors on projects that are wide-ranging and have real impact. Learn about trading through classes and build bots that compete on a simulated exchange. Past interns have built protocol compilers, hacked on the internals of our concurrency library, and built real-time visualization tools. Many intern projects are subsequently released as open-source.
