Here are some alternative facts.Â Whether it is a medical claim for a personal injury, a property claim after a damaging storm or an auto body repair claim after a car accident, insurance company will try to get a settlement as quickly as possible for the least amount possible. All too often, circumstances or financialÂ issues cause claimants to immediately settle for the first offer presented to them.Auto AccidentsEmployment LawWorkers CompensationIn an article posted by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette www.post-gazette.com, thousands of injured workers statewide could receive more benefits after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down a key part of the workers' compensation law.Criminal LawTraffic ViolationsIn Pennsylvania, most people are probably aware of the dangers of distracted driving thanks to awareness programs and state laws.

Curriculum Vitae









 Biography




				I grew up in Concord, California, graduating from Concord High School in 1975.  I am a veteran of the U.S. Army, serving as a medic stationed at Ft. Polk, Louisiana from 1976-1979.  I served a mission for the LDS church in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  I am married to Beth Kunz and have five children:  Emily, Jacob, Sara, Rachel and Samuel.  We live in the town of Genola at the southern end of Utah County.
			






 Teaching Interests




My main teaching assignment is genetics, which I have taught for 8 years.  I also teach a senior-level course called Readings in Biotechnology that introduces students to biotechnological innovations that are shaping our world.  I teach a graduate course in Plant Cell Biology.







 Research Interests




Currently I am parted of a multi-institutional collaboration studying cheatgrass, an invasive annual weed of the western U.S.  We are also interested in a fungal pathogen that attacks cheatgrass seeds in the soil.
