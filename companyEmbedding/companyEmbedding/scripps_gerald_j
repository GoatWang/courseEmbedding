A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works.

About the Author:
                                                Gerald J. Baldasty is associate professor of communications at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Review:
                                                "Baldasty recounts behind-the-scenes family intrigues and conflicts over ownership in this detailed, well-researched book." - Vanessa Bush, Booklist "Baldasty has written the type of book we all like to cite as a good example to our students... This study of Edward Willis Scripps, an early press baron who was an advocate for the emerging working class after the Civil War, is based on manuscripts, newspapers, and other primary sources and integrates findings from the wide array of secondary sources about the turn-of-the-century years that also witnessed the early careers of Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst. Baldasty's book rewards the tendency for historians to read the footnotes." -- Donald L. Shaw, American Historical Review "Offers a specialized examination of Scripps's business practices and assumes a basic background in newspaper history. A welcome addition to academic journalism collections." - Library Journal "Tightly written with an exemplary notes section... Fills a gap in the history of newspaper business and demonstrates the value of using quantitative methods and original records in historical research." - Choice "Written with exemplary clarity... A fascinating contribution to the history of newspaper publishing." - Christine Shaw, Business History "An exciting, new offering ... Baldasty's analysis is crisp, well-thought and executed. He has made a tremendous contribution by his astute insights and thorough research... A significant contribution to the literature of journalism history."- Barbara Straus Reed, EH Net (H-Net Reviews) "Highly readable at the same time that it is carefully based on the evidence. Baldasty is nearly invisible as an analyst and interpreter; yet the presentation of the evidence and organization of the book represent his behind-the-scenes analysis. The book is especially valuable for demonstrating how systematic business practices both succeeded and failed in Scripps's development of the first modern chain. It is an important example of a well done business history of the press that sticks to business." - Carolyn Stewart Dyer, Journalism History "Fascinating... Baldasty successfully achieves his goal of 'raising' the low profile of E. W. Scripps." - Louis Cain, Journal of Economic History "This book's main strength is its rich data on newspaper content in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries... Well written and meticulously documented, and it generously offers prominent citations of the work of other, often younger, scholars. It is a most welcome addition to the literature." - William S. Solomon, The Journal of American History "Baldasty has expertly woven Scripps' newly available business correspondence into an illuminating look at this major and contradictory figure in the development of today's newspaper." -- Anne Hecker, Journal of the West ADVANCE PRAISE "Scripps, with the manners of a buccaneer, defied the conventional wisdom about news in a market economy. Baldasty's vivid study of risk-taking will help anyone drawing up plans to keep newspapers central to a democratic society."- Thomas C. Leonard, author of News for All: America's Coming-of-Age with the Press "An extraordinarily well-documented work. Baldasty has made a significant contribution to the literature by showing how Scripps's strategies had a coherent structure within the realm of business practices."- Barbara Cloud, author of The Business of Newspapers on the Western Frontier "[This] first systematic study of the nation's first newspaper chain ... will greatly inform the history of journalism and much enliven contemporary arguments about the news media and group ownership."- James L. Baughman, author of The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America since 1941 "One of the finest of the surviving Byzantine manuscripts... The digital version features full-color magnified views of all pages, searchable text in original Greek and in English translation, and scholarly essays." -- Theology Digest "The very precise information about the text's provenance and attribution ... have made this psalter a central reference point in discussion of Byzantine illuminated manuscripts. Now reproduced in electronic form, this important text, containing 440 illustrations, becomes accessible at an extremely reasonable price to a much broader audience than customarily studies Byzantine manuscripts... A very encouraging attempt to produce a Byzantine manuscript in electronic form." -- Catherine Holmes, Ecclesiastical History

Book Description University of Illinois Press, United States, 1999. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. Edward Willis Scripps revolutionized the newspaper industry by applying modern business practices to his chain of more than forty newspapers and creating a telegraphic news service and illustrated news features syndicate. Convinced that big business was corrupting the American press, Scripps actively resisted supporting his newspapers through advertising. He also aimed them at the working class, an audience virtually ignored by most newspaper publishers of his era. Maintaining that the press should support the democratic endeavor by informing its largest constituency, Scripps succeeded in creating a string of small, cheap newspapers that were advocates for the common people: crusading for lower streetcar fares, free textbooks for public school children, municipal ownership of utilities, and pure food legislation, among many other causes. Gerald Baldasty s portrait of this long-neglected entrepreneurial giant is the first major academic study to draw on Scripps business correspondence. The Theodore Psalter is one of the most valuable illuminated manuscripts to survive from the Byzantine Empire. One of only a few fixed points guiding the historian s understanding of Byzantine art and society, the Theodore Psalter s illumination is a uniquely rich source of insight into monastic organization, spirituality, book production, and a host of other aspects of Byzantine life. This facsimile CD-ROM version of the Psalter, produced from the original text held in the British Library Rare Books collection, offers unprecedented, virtual hands-on access to this precious volume. The innovative electronic format provides a complete display of all 416 pages, with magnified views of every illustration as well as a fully searchable text in the original Greek and in English translation. Complete with hyperlinked descriptions and full identifications of figures on every page, the facsimile is accompanied by three scholarly essays, by Charles Barber and by John Lowden of the Courtauld Institute of Art, London. Combining cutting-edge technology with first-rate scholarship, The Theodore Psalter (electronic facsimile) serves as an indispensable tool for art historians and affords a fascinating opportunity for other adventurous readers to interact with a rare treasure.

About the Book
+
-

   Scripps's innovations included the creation of a telegraphic news service and an illustrated news features syndicate and the application of modern business practices to his chain of more than forty newspapers. His newspapers, aimed at working-class readers, were intended to be advocates for the common people and crusaded for lower streetcar fares, free textbooks for public school children, municipal ownership of utilities, pure food legislation, and many other causes.

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
