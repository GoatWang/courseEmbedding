State senate[edit]
In 1992, after 16 years as an elected official in Lawrence County, Skillman was elected to the Indiana State Senate, where she represented Lawrence, Monroe, Jackson, Washington, and Orange Counties. Rising quickly through the leadership, she became Majority Caucus Chair, the first woman in history to serve in the Senate Republican leadership. During her 12 years in the Senate, she led the charge to include the state's small towns and rural communities in its economic development agenda. There, she authored plans for development in distressed counties and for the revitalization of downtown areas.
Lieutenant governor[edit]
Mitch Daniels selected Skillman to be his running mate during the 2004 election. The ticket was elected over incumbent Governor Joe Kernan and incumbent Lieutenant Governor Kathy Davis and she took office in January.
As Indiana's 49th Lt. Governor, Skillman held more legal duties than any other Lt. Governor in the country. Upon taking office in 2005, Skillman also served as the Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development under the state's Department of Agriculture and Office of Community Rural Affairs. She managed five state agencies in total, and administered more than $1 billion in programs. Other agencies under Skillman's direction as Lt. Governor included the Office of Energy Development, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, and the Office of Tourism Development. Additionally, she chaired the state's Counter Terrorism and Security Council, the intergovernmental entity responsible for homeland security, and served as President of the Indiana Senate.
Skillman was also responsible for shepherding Governor Mitch Daniels's Administration's legislative agenda through the Indiana General Assembly and served as President of the Senate.
Radius Indiana[edit]
Skillman currently serves as President/CEO of Radius Indiana, an eight-county economic development corporation in South Central Indiana, where she assumed her duties in February 2013. She continues to serve as the co-chair of the Indiana Bicentennial Commission, with former U.S. Congressman Lee Hamilton.
2012 election[edit]
Skillman had considered a run for Indiana Governor in 2012 but announced she would not due to a minor medical condition.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Skillman and her husband Steve have a son, Aaron. Skillman is a member of the Church of Christ. In August 2010 Skillman earned an associate degree in business from Indiana Wesleyan University.[3]

Early life and career[edit]
Skillman is a native of Bedford, Lawrence County, Indiana. An alumna of Indiana Wesleyan University, she began her career in politics in 1977 when she was elected to the office of Lawrence County Recorder. Eight years later she was elected as County Clerk. Skillman served as President of the Association of Indiana Counties.

State senate[edit]
In 1992, after 16 years as an elected official in Lawrence County, Skillman was elected to the Indiana State Senate, where she represented Lawrence, Monroe, Jackson, Washington, and Orange Counties. Rising quickly through the leadership, she became Majority Caucus Chair, the first woman in history to serve in the Senate Republican leadership. During her 12 years in the Senate, she led the charge to include the state's small towns and rural communities in its economic development agenda. There, she authored plans for development in distressed counties and for the revitalization of downtown areas.
Lieutenant governor[edit]
Mitch Daniels selected Skillman to be his running mate during the 2004 election. The ticket was elected over incumbent Governor Joe Kernan and incumbent Lieutenant Governor Kathy Davis and she took office in January.
As Indiana's 49th Lt. Governor, Skillman held more legal duties than any other Lt. Governor in the country. Upon taking office in 2005, Skillman also served as the Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development under the state's Department of Agriculture and Office of Community Rural Affairs. She managed five state agencies in total, and administered more than $1 billion in programs. Other agencies under Skillman's direction as Lt. Governor included the Office of Energy Development, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, and the Office of Tourism Development. Additionally, she chaired the state's Counter Terrorism and Security Council, the intergovernmental entity responsible for homeland security, and served as President of the Indiana Senate.
Skillman was also responsible for shepherding Governor Mitch Daniels's Administration's legislative agenda through the Indiana General Assembly and served as President of the Senate.
Radius Indiana[edit]
Skillman currently serves as President/CEO of Radius Indiana, an eight-county economic development corporation in South Central Indiana, where she assumed her duties in February 2013. She continues to serve as the co-chair of the Indiana Bicentennial Commission, with former U.S. Congressman Lee Hamilton.
2012 election[edit]
Skillman had considered a run for Indiana Governor in 2012 but announced she would not due to a minor medical condition.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Skillman and her husband Steve have a son, Aaron. Skillman is a member of the Church of Christ. In August 2010 Skillman earned an associate degree in business from Indiana Wesleyan University.[3]

Rebecca S. SkillmanYou are here: Home » History » Skillman Biographies » Rebecca S. Skillman






Rebecca S. “Becky” Skillman is a Hoosier and native of Bedford, Lawrence County, Indiana where she was born on September 26, 1950. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Steve, and they have a son named Aaron.
Becky began her political career in 1977 when she was elected to the office of Lawrence County Recorder. Eight years later, she was elected as County Clerk. In 1992, Becky was elected to the Indiana State Senate, where she represented Lawrence, Monroe, Jackson, Washington, and Orange Counties. She also served as President of the Association of Indiana Counties. During her 12 years in the Senate, she led the charge to include the state’s small towns and rural communities in its economic development agenda. There, she authored plans for development in distressed counties and revitalization of downtown areas. Rising quickly through the leadership, she became Majority Caucus Chair, the first woman in history to serve in the Senate Republican leadership, and the first elected female Lieutenant Governor in Indiana history when Mitch Daniels selected her to be his running mate during the 2004 election. Becky was sworn in on January 10, 2005 and served two terms as the 49th and 50th Lieutenant Governor of Indiana.

The National Lieutenant Governors Association said Becky Skillman had more legal duties than any other Lt. Governor in the country. She soundly managed five state agencies with operating budgets totaling $1 billion — the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, the Office of Energy Development, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, and the Office of Tourism Development. Additionally, she chaired the state’s Counter Terrorism and Security Council, and served as President of the Indiana Senate. 
In 2012, Becky considered a run for Indiana Governor but then announced she would not pursue the office due to a minor medical condition.
