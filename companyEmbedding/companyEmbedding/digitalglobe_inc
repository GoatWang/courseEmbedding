Uber has already revolutionized transportation by making it simple.Now Uber plans to make it even more accurate and trouble-free, using current, high-resolution satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe to identify the best pick-up and drop-off locations.Urban landscapes are always in flux: new lanes, construction everywhere, altered traffic patterns. With its frequent revisits, our satellite constellation often detects these street-scale changes before a city adds them to its official vector map, improving the experience for riders and drivers around the world.And even beyond the value of precise end-route navigation to human drivers today, this level of geolocation accuracy will become increasingly important in the years ahead, as Uber embraces the DigtitalGlobe in its transition to a fleet of fully autonomous cars.

Wireless demand continues to accelerate globally, as exploding populations of always-on users demand more bandwidth for more data, stressing even the most robust networks.Optimizing network growth and capacity is an ongoing race to maximize radio frequency (RF) coverage, which means planning the most efficient antenna configurations—now and for years to come. A key factor in that planning: accurate terrain maps.In Latin America, our French partner Siradel leveraged our deep stereo archive of high-resolution, time-lapse imagery to develop their RF propagation model, revealing gaps in network quality they use to guide future growth.With this cost-effective methodology and DigitalGlobe’s up-to-date global coverage, Siradel can now conduct large-scale, wireless network design in literally any environment.

The seventh-most populous nation in the world couldn't accurately map its roads or measure its cities. More than 50 years old, Nigeria’s outdated analog maps were unreliable colonial-era remnants, rendered even less useful by decades of the country’s explosive growth and environmental changes.Without current maps, planners were ill-equipped to make informed decisions regarding land, infrastructure, and resource use for an ever-increasing population, more than half living below the poverty line.Until Aerial-View Solutions, our Nigerian partner, offered an affordable solution. Using DigitalGlobe’s current and high-resolution imagery, they addressed long-standing mapping problems, including spotting encroachment and creating street guidesand township maps where they did not exist before.With the spatial insight from an accurate, current countrywide map, Nigeria stands better prepared to address the challenges facing a modern nation.

Existing population maps for many remote parts of the world are outdated, so to reach the 4.2 billion people still offline, Facebook is analyzing billions of DigitalGlobe’s highest-resolution images to create the most accurate population density models ever.Starting from DigitalGlobe’s mosaic of the globe at 50cm resolution, Facebook’s computer-vision algorithms leverage our Geospatial Big Data platform, GBDX, to identify man-made structures as a proxy for where people live. Facebook can then see how best to deploy terrestrial networks, satellites, and its massive solar-powered Aquila drones to provide low-cost Internet connectivity to the developing world.Advances like these, in cloud computing and deep learning, help everyone. That’s why we’ll be adding population estimation tools to GBDX’s platform, to allow us all to build and innovate together.

When is a pixelnot a pixel?

When it wasn’t there to begin with. Resampling can’t compensate for low-resolution imagery, and post-processing software can’t create information that wasn’t captured in the first place.With unsurpassed native resolution and locational accuracy, the images in DigitalGlobe’s library contain significantly more information than resampled lower-resolution alternatives. We call this superior image quality True30 and True50.*

Style Scores:

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Origins[edit]
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in Oakland, California in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.[2] Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high resolution commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.[3] The company was initially funded with private financing from Silicon Valley sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan. Dr. Scott was head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the Intergraph Corporation.[4] The company's first remote sensing license from the United States Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing satellite capable of collecting images with 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution.[2]
In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.'s commercial remote sensing operations.[5] In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.[6]
In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider GlobeXplorer to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.[7]
In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.[8]
In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.
In February 2017, MDA and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.[9]
Satellites[edit]
EarlyBird-1[edit]
EarlyBird-1 was launched for Earth Watch Inc. on December 24, 1997, from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a Start-1 launch vehicle.[10] It included a panchromatic camera with a 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 15 m (49 ft) resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.
IKONOS[edit]
Main article: IKONOS
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with .80 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.[11] On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.[12]
QuickBird[edit]
Main article: QuickBird
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,[5] was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450 km altitude, −98 degree inclination sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a 60 cm (24 in) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.[12]
GeoEye-1[edit]
Main article: GeoEye-1
The GeoEye-1 satellite is equipped with some of the most advanced technology ever used in a commercial remote sensing system. The satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This capability is ideal for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.
WorldView satellites[edit]
WorldView-1[edit]
Main article: WorldView-1
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-1.[13] It was launched on September 18, 2007 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II 7920-10C. Launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is expected to be a major customer of WorldView-1 imagery.[14] It included a panchromatic only camera with a 50 cm (20 in) maximum resolution.
WorldView-2[edit]
Main article: WorldView-2
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on October 8, 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a sun-synchronous orbit.[15][16] The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a 46 cm (18 in) maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 184 cm (72 in)[17]
WorldView-3[edit]
Main article: WorldView-3
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of 25 cm (9.8 in). WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 617 km (383 mi), where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to 680,000 km2 (260,000 sq mi).[18]
Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a resolution below 50 cm (20 in) to the US military.[19] However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its highest-quality and industry-leading commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm (39 in) multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.[20]
WorldView-3 is the industry's first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.[21]
WorldView-4[edit]
Main article: WorldView-4
The WorldView-4 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 0.31 meters per pixel (12.2 in/px), and multispectral images at 1.24 meters per pixel (48.8 in/px).[22] Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin,[23] while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.[24]
Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required.[25][26] It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016.[27][28]
Customers[edit]
DigitalGlobe’s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team,[29] to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA[6] and the United States Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[30] Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe,[31] as is imagery used in TerraServer[32] and Apple Maps.[33] DigitalGlobe's main competitors were GeoEye (formerly Orbimage and Space Imaging), before their merger with DigitalGlobe, and still Spot Image.

Main article: WorldView-2
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on October 8, 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a sun-synchronous orbit.[15][16] The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a 46 cm (18 in) maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 184 cm (72 in)[17]
WorldView-3[edit]
Main article: WorldView-3
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of 25 cm (9.8 in). WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 617 km (383 mi), where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to 680,000 km2 (260,000 sq mi).[18]
Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a resolution below 50 cm (20 in) to the US military.[19] However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its highest-quality and industry-leading commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm (39 in) multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.[20]
WorldView-3 is the industry's first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.[21]
WorldView-4[edit]
Main article: WorldView-4
The WorldView-4 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 0.31 meters per pixel (12.2 in/px), and multispectral images at 1.24 meters per pixel (48.8 in/px).[22] Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin,[23] while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.[24]
Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required.[25][26] It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016.[27][28]
Customers[edit]
DigitalGlobe’s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team,[29] to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA[6] and the United States Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[30] Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe,[31] as is imagery used in TerraServer[32] and Apple Maps.[33] DigitalGlobe's main competitors were GeoEye (formerly Orbimage and Space Imaging), before their merger with DigitalGlobe, and still Spot Image.

Origins[edit]
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in Oakland, California in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.[2] Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high resolution commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.[3] The company was initially funded with private financing from Silicon Valley sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan. Dr. Scott was head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the Intergraph Corporation.[4] The company's first remote sensing license from the United States Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing satellite capable of collecting images with 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution.[2]
In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.'s commercial remote sensing operations.[5] In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.[6]
In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider GlobeXplorer to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.[7]
In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.[8]
In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.
In February 2017, MDA and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.[9]
Satellites[edit]
EarlyBird-1[edit]
EarlyBird-1 was launched for Earth Watch Inc. on December 24, 1997, from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a Start-1 launch vehicle.[10] It included a panchromatic camera with a 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 15 m (49 ft) resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.
IKONOS[edit]
Main article: IKONOS
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with .80 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.[11] On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.[12]
QuickBird[edit]
Main article: QuickBird
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,[5] was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450 km altitude, −98 degree inclination sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a 60 cm (24 in) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.[12]
GeoEye-1[edit]
Main article: GeoEye-1
The GeoEye-1 satellite is equipped with some of the most advanced technology ever used in a commercial remote sensing system. The satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This capability is ideal for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.

It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with .80 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.[11] On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.[12]
QuickBird[edit]
Main article: QuickBird
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,[5] was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450 km altitude, −98 degree inclination sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a 60 cm (24 in) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.[12]
GeoEye-1[edit]
Main article: GeoEye-1
The GeoEye-1 satellite is equipped with some of the most advanced technology ever used in a commercial remote sensing system. The satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This capability is ideal for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.
WorldView satellites[edit]
WorldView-1[edit]
Main article: WorldView-1
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-1.[13] It was launched on September 18, 2007 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II 7920-10C. Launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is expected to be a major customer of WorldView-1 imagery.[14] It included a panchromatic only camera with a 50 cm (20 in) maximum resolution.
WorldView-2[edit]
Main article: WorldView-2
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on October 8, 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a sun-synchronous orbit.[15][16] The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a 46 cm (18 in) maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 184 cm (72 in)[17]
WorldView-3[edit]
Main article: WorldView-3
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of 25 cm (9.8 in). WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 617 km (383 mi), where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to 680,000 km2 (260,000 sq mi).[18]
Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a resolution below 50 cm (20 in) to the US military.[19] However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its highest-quality and industry-leading commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm (39 in) multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.[20]
WorldView-3 is the industry's first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.[21]
WorldView-4[edit]
Main article: WorldView-4
The WorldView-4 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 0.31 meters per pixel (12.2 in/px), and multispectral images at 1.24 meters per pixel (48.8 in/px).[22] Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin,[23] while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.[24]
Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required.[25][26] It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016.[27][28]
Customers[edit]
DigitalGlobe’s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team,[29] to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA[6] and the United States Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[30] Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe,[31] as is imagery used in TerraServer[32] and Apple Maps.[33] DigitalGlobe's main competitors were GeoEye (formerly Orbimage and Space Imaging), before their merger with DigitalGlobe, and still Spot Image.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Uber has already revolutionized transportation by making it simple.Now Uber plans to make it even more accurate and trouble-free, using current, high-resolution satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe to identify the best pick-up and drop-off locations.Urban landscapes are always in flux: new lanes, construction everywhere, altered traffic patterns. With its frequent revisits, our satellite constellation often detects these street-scale changes before a city adds them to its official vector map, improving the experience for riders and drivers around the world.And even beyond the value of precise end-route navigation to human drivers today, this level of geolocation accuracy will become increasingly important in the years ahead, as Uber embraces the DigtitalGlobe in its transition to a fleet of fully autonomous cars.

Wireless demand continues to accelerate globally, as exploding populations of always-on users demand more bandwidth for more data, stressing even the most robust networks.Optimizing network growth and capacity is an ongoing race to maximize radio frequency (RF) coverage, which means planning the most efficient antenna configurations—now and for years to come. A key factor in that planning: accurate terrain maps.In Latin America, our French partner Siradel leveraged our deep stereo archive of high-resolution, time-lapse imagery to develop their RF propagation model, revealing gaps in network quality they use to guide future growth.With this cost-effective methodology and DigitalGlobe’s up-to-date global coverage, Siradel can now conduct large-scale, wireless network design in literally any environment.

The seventh-most populous nation in the world couldn't accurately map its roads or measure its cities. More than 50 years old, Nigeria’s outdated analog maps were unreliable colonial-era remnants, rendered even less useful by decades of the country’s explosive growth and environmental changes.Without current maps, planners were ill-equipped to make informed decisions regarding land, infrastructure, and resource use for an ever-increasing population, more than half living below the poverty line.Until Aerial-View Solutions, our Nigerian partner, offered an affordable solution. Using DigitalGlobe’s current and high-resolution imagery, they addressed long-standing mapping problems, including spotting encroachment and creating street guidesand township maps where they did not exist before.With the spatial insight from an accurate, current countrywide map, Nigeria stands better prepared to address the challenges facing a modern nation.

Existing population maps for many remote parts of the world are outdated, so to reach the 4.2 billion people still offline, Facebook is analyzing billions of DigitalGlobe’s highest-resolution images to create the most accurate population density models ever.Starting from DigitalGlobe’s mosaic of the globe at 50cm resolution, Facebook’s computer-vision algorithms leverage our Geospatial Big Data platform, GBDX, to identify man-made structures as a proxy for where people live. Facebook can then see how best to deploy terrestrial networks, satellites, and its massive solar-powered Aquila drones to provide low-cost Internet connectivity to the developing world.Advances like these, in cloud computing and deep learning, help everyone. That’s why we’ll be adding population estimation tools to GBDX’s platform, to allow us all to build and innovate together.

When is a pixelnot a pixel?

When it wasn’t there to begin with. Resampling can’t compensate for low-resolution imagery, and post-processing software can’t create information that wasn’t captured in the first place.With unsurpassed native resolution and locational accuracy, the images in DigitalGlobe’s library contain significantly more information than resampled lower-resolution alternatives. We call this superior image quality True30 and True50.*

Origins[edit]
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in Oakland, California in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.[2] Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high resolution commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.[3] The company was initially funded with private financing from Silicon Valley sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan. Dr. Scott was head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the Intergraph Corporation.[4] The company's first remote sensing license from the United States Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing satellite capable of collecting images with 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution.[2]
In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.'s commercial remote sensing operations.[5] In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.[6]
In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider GlobeXplorer to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.[7]
In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.[8]
In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.
In February 2017, MDA and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.[9]
Satellites[edit]
EarlyBird-1[edit]
EarlyBird-1 was launched for Earth Watch Inc. on December 24, 1997, from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a Start-1 launch vehicle.[10] It included a panchromatic camera with a 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 15 m (49 ft) resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.
IKONOS[edit]
Main article: IKONOS
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with .80 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.[11] On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.[12]
QuickBird[edit]
Main article: QuickBird
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,[5] was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450 km altitude, −98 degree inclination sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a 60 cm (24 in) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.[12]
GeoEye-1[edit]
Main article: GeoEye-1
The GeoEye-1 satellite is equipped with some of the most advanced technology ever used in a commercial remote sensing system. The satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This capability is ideal for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.
WorldView satellites[edit]
WorldView-1[edit]
Main article: WorldView-1
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-1.[13] It was launched on September 18, 2007 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II 7920-10C. Launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is expected to be a major customer of WorldView-1 imagery.[14] It included a panchromatic only camera with a 50 cm (20 in) maximum resolution.
WorldView-2[edit]
Main article: WorldView-2
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on October 8, 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a sun-synchronous orbit.[15][16] The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a 46 cm (18 in) maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 184 cm (72 in)[17]
WorldView-3[edit]
Main article: WorldView-3
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of 25 cm (9.8 in). WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 617 km (383 mi), where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to 680,000 km2 (260,000 sq mi).[18]
Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a resolution below 50 cm (20 in) to the US military.[19] However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its highest-quality and industry-leading commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm (39 in) multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.[20]
WorldView-3 is the industry's first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.[21]
WorldView-4[edit]
Main article: WorldView-4
The WorldView-4 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 0.31 meters per pixel (12.2 in/px), and multispectral images at 1.24 meters per pixel (48.8 in/px).[22] Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin,[23] while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.[24]
Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required.[25][26] It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016.[27][28]
Customers[edit]
DigitalGlobe’s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team,[29] to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA[6] and the United States Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[30] Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe,[31] as is imagery used in TerraServer[32] and Apple Maps.[33] DigitalGlobe's main competitors were GeoEye (formerly Orbimage and Space Imaging), before their merger with DigitalGlobe, and still Spot Image.

Uber has already revolutionized transportation by making it simple.Now Uber plans to make it even more accurate and trouble-free, using current, high-resolution satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe to identify the best pick-up and drop-off locations.Urban landscapes are always in flux: new lanes, construction everywhere, altered traffic patterns. With its frequent revisits, our satellite constellation often detects these street-scale changes before a city adds them to its official vector map, improving the experience for riders and drivers around the world.And even beyond the value of precise end-route navigation to human drivers today, this level of geolocation accuracy will become increasingly important in the years ahead, as Uber embraces the DigtitalGlobe in its transition to a fleet of fully autonomous cars.

Wireless demand continues to accelerate globally, as exploding populations of always-on users demand more bandwidth for more data, stressing even the most robust networks.Optimizing network growth and capacity is an ongoing race to maximize radio frequency (RF) coverage, which means planning the most efficient antenna configurations—now and for years to come. A key factor in that planning: accurate terrain maps.In Latin America, our French partner Siradel leveraged our deep stereo archive of high-resolution, time-lapse imagery to develop their RF propagation model, revealing gaps in network quality they use to guide future growth.With this cost-effective methodology and DigitalGlobe’s up-to-date global coverage, Siradel can now conduct large-scale, wireless network design in literally any environment.

The seventh-most populous nation in the world couldn't accurately map its roads or measure its cities. More than 50 years old, Nigeria’s outdated analog maps were unreliable colonial-era remnants, rendered even less useful by decades of the country’s explosive growth and environmental changes.Without current maps, planners were ill-equipped to make informed decisions regarding land, infrastructure, and resource use for an ever-increasing population, more than half living below the poverty line.Until Aerial-View Solutions, our Nigerian partner, offered an affordable solution. Using DigitalGlobe’s current and high-resolution imagery, they addressed long-standing mapping problems, including spotting encroachment and creating street guidesand township maps where they did not exist before.With the spatial insight from an accurate, current countrywide map, Nigeria stands better prepared to address the challenges facing a modern nation.

Existing population maps for many remote parts of the world are outdated, so to reach the 4.2 billion people still offline, Facebook is analyzing billions of DigitalGlobe’s highest-resolution images to create the most accurate population density models ever.Starting from DigitalGlobe’s mosaic of the globe at 50cm resolution, Facebook’s computer-vision algorithms leverage our Geospatial Big Data platform, GBDX, to identify man-made structures as a proxy for where people live. Facebook can then see how best to deploy terrestrial networks, satellites, and its massive solar-powered Aquila drones to provide low-cost Internet connectivity to the developing world.Advances like these, in cloud computing and deep learning, help everyone. That’s why we’ll be adding population estimation tools to GBDX’s platform, to allow us all to build and innovate together.

Origins[edit]
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in Oakland, California in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.[2] Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high resolution commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.[3] The company was initially funded with private financing from Silicon Valley sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan. Dr. Scott was head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the Intergraph Corporation.[4] The company's first remote sensing license from the United States Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing satellite capable of collecting images with 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution.[2]
In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.'s commercial remote sensing operations.[5] In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.[6]
In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider GlobeXplorer to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.[7]
In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.[8]
In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.
In February 2017, MDA and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.[9]
Satellites[edit]
EarlyBird-1[edit]
EarlyBird-1 was launched for Earth Watch Inc. on December 24, 1997, from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a Start-1 launch vehicle.[10] It included a panchromatic camera with a 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 15 m (49 ft) resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.
IKONOS[edit]
Main article: IKONOS
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with .80 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.[11] On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.[12]
QuickBird[edit]
Main article: QuickBird
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,[5] was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450 km altitude, −98 degree inclination sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a 60 cm (24 in) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.[12]
GeoEye-1[edit]
Main article: GeoEye-1
The GeoEye-1 satellite is equipped with some of the most advanced technology ever used in a commercial remote sensing system. The satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This capability is ideal for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.
WorldView satellites[edit]
WorldView-1[edit]
Main article: WorldView-1
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-1.[13] It was launched on September 18, 2007 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II 7920-10C. Launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is expected to be a major customer of WorldView-1 imagery.[14] It included a panchromatic only camera with a 50 cm (20 in) maximum resolution.
WorldView-2[edit]
Main article: WorldView-2
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on October 8, 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a sun-synchronous orbit.[15][16] The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a 46 cm (18 in) maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 184 cm (72 in)[17]
WorldView-3[edit]
Main article: WorldView-3
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of 25 cm (9.8 in). WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 617 km (383 mi), where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to 680,000 km2 (260,000 sq mi).[18]
Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a resolution below 50 cm (20 in) to the US military.[19] However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its highest-quality and industry-leading commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm (39 in) multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.[20]
WorldView-3 is the industry's first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.[21]
WorldView-4[edit]
Main article: WorldView-4
The WorldView-4 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 0.31 meters per pixel (12.2 in/px), and multispectral images at 1.24 meters per pixel (48.8 in/px).[22] Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin,[23] while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.[24]
Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required.[25][26] It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016.[27][28]
Customers[edit]
DigitalGlobe’s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team,[29] to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA[6] and the United States Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[30] Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe,[31] as is imagery used in TerraServer[32] and Apple Maps.[33] DigitalGlobe's main competitors were GeoEye (formerly Orbimage and Space Imaging), before their merger with DigitalGlobe, and still Spot Image.

Origins[edit]
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in Oakland, California in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.[2] Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high resolution commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.[3] The company was initially funded with private financing from Silicon Valley sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan. Dr. Scott was head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the Intergraph Corporation.[4] The company's first remote sensing license from the United States Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing satellite capable of collecting images with 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution.[2]
In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.'s commercial remote sensing operations.[5] In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.[6]
In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider GlobeXplorer to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.[7]
In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.[8]
In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.
In February 2017, MDA and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.[9]
Satellites[edit]
EarlyBird-1[edit]
EarlyBird-1 was launched for Earth Watch Inc. on December 24, 1997, from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a Start-1 launch vehicle.[10] It included a panchromatic camera with a 3 m (9.8 ft) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 15 m (49 ft) resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.
IKONOS[edit]
Main article: IKONOS
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with .80 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.[11] On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.[12]
QuickBird[edit]
Main article: QuickBird
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,[5] was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450 km altitude, −98 degree inclination sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a 60 cm (24 in) resolution and a multispectral camera with a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.[12]
GeoEye-1[edit]
Main article: GeoEye-1
The GeoEye-1 satellite is equipped with some of the most advanced technology ever used in a commercial remote sensing system. The satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This capability is ideal for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.
WorldView satellites[edit]
WorldView-1[edit]
Main article: WorldView-1
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-1.[13] It was launched on September 18, 2007 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II 7920-10C. Launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is expected to be a major customer of WorldView-1 imagery.[14] It included a panchromatic only camera with a 50 cm (20 in) maximum resolution.
WorldView-2[edit]
Main article: WorldView-2
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on October 8, 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a sun-synchronous orbit.[15][16] The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a 46 cm (18 in) maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 184 cm (72 in)[17]
WorldView-3[edit]
Main article: WorldView-3
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of 25 cm (9.8 in). WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 617 km (383 mi), where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to 680,000 km2 (260,000 sq mi).[18]
Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a resolution below 50 cm (20 in) to the US military.[19] However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its highest-quality and industry-leading commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm (39 in) multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.[20]
WorldView-3 is the industry's first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.[21]
WorldView-4[edit]
Main article: WorldView-4
The WorldView-4 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of 0.31 meters per pixel (12.2 in/px), and multispectral images at 1.24 meters per pixel (48.8 in/px).[22] Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin,[23] while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.[24]
Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required.[25][26] It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016.[27][28]
Customers[edit]
DigitalGlobe’s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team,[29] to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA[6] and the United States Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[30] Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe,[31] as is imagery used in TerraServer[32] and Apple Maps.[33] DigitalGlobe's main competitors were GeoEye (formerly Orbimage and Space Imaging), before their merger with DigitalGlobe, and still Spot Image.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
