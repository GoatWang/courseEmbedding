            I have 8 grandchildren ages 1-9. Could this be used as a playhouse? Regular playhouses I've looked at are too small.

            Can this be built from the inside or would I need room to walk around it to put it together?
        

            I have 8' 4&quot; width from my side of my home to a fence and am wondering if this shed could be squeezed in there.

            broken pieces...bought 2nd hand..where to order parts from..what are the model numbers?
        

            I recently bought a similar Lifetime shed from a man that was loosing his house. While taking it apart the roof fell in and some screws broke out (leaving a square piece of plastic missing around several screws about a 1/2inch X 1/2inch in size)..how do I fix this? Also where would the model number be located on the shed? Where could I get a parts list/instruction manual? Thank you for all the help!!

This was the 3rd plastic shed bought and put together by me and a couple of grand-kids. The first two were Rubbermaid Big Max models. I went with Lifetime's 8 X 12.5 due to the storage capacity. If you are deciding between metal, wood and plastic for your shed, don't be discouraged by the word plastic. Perhaps plastic has been used before to define a cheaply-made product that won't last or perform as it should. That's simply not the case with plastic sheds. My first two have been subjected to hail, wind and snow with not so much as a scratch. I was extremely satisfied with the hail resistance as that storm (Colorado Springs, 07/16) amounted to over a billion dollars in insurance claims. The only property I had that wasn't damaged by the storm were my plastic sheds (and of course, the property stored inside the sheds). Me, an 11 year-old and 6 year-old put this Lifetime shed together in just over 6 hours. Granted, our experience gained from the Big Max sheds was helpful. We didn't erect the included shelving as Edsal storage racks (also purchased from Home Depot) were emplaced. The shed is on brick pavers with a slight downward tilt for water mitigation. That did cause very slight differences when placing the wall panels into the floor. Those minor challenges were overcome with a Dremel and a metal cutting wheel. While not necessary, we also used clear window/siding caulk on every seam and micro-opening just to ensure water tightness and prevention of invading insects. Sure, you can push on a wall panel and it will slightly 'give'. But the final constructed product is solid. The grandkids remarked that we had literally built a house, given the size and stability. There is no reason to think that this Lifetime shed will succumb to environmental conditions as it is pretty much the same as the Big Max sheds. I watched all of the Lifetime shed-building video clips on YouTube while following along with the accompanying user manual before grabbing a tool. That was very helpful when the actual assembly began. I do wish they would have filmed the assembly outdoors, rather than a nice, cozy and windless warehouse. If you do assemble this shed in any sort of breezy conditions, you'll need more 'hands on deck' to just keep the erected panels stable. Overall, great product that will stand up to Mother Nature and give you tons of good storage. Putting it together with grandkids boosted their self-confidence 'through the roof'. Together, we kinda did build a house!

        Difficult to construct
Especially the doors. Had a pro help me and we couldn't get the doors to work as they should. Putting any and all of the parts together was difficult. There is no margin for error. There should be 1/16" margin, but there is zero. The base MUST be level for things to fit. Work slow and do it right the first time no matter how arduous is my advice. But a good and sturdy product.

Easy to follow the instructions and assemble took one night to pre build and then my son and I built it the next morning with the afternoon to fill it with my stuff. Like the supper easy assembly not much to dislike maybe the door seal rails but not a big deal really. Definitely met my expectations.

Would have given 4 stars but delivered to the store instead of home so that was a 3-day delay. Customer Service levels at the 800# were terrible and no apologies from store or customer support. As far as the shed, 2 people about 7 hours. Menards is a bit further but customer service is much better.

This shed is really durable and sturdy, but really attractive too. The floor is steady and resists dirt, dents or cracks. It's very roomy and useful! We hired a pro to assemble it with very little trouble. Looks like it will last forever. Love it!

Very impressed with the shed.  Took about five hours to build by myself with help from my wife for about an hour.  One piece came damaged with the hole in it but the company sent me out a new one within a week.

Lifetime Shed with Extension kit
I just built the Lifetime Shed with Extension kit. I am so far very pleased with the shed. It seems very sturdy and in fact the first night it was built we had a major wind and rain storm and it had no leaks or damage. I am impressed with the craftsmanship and quality of the materials. It is a nice looking shed and has a lot of usable space. It comes with the shelving kit which is actually very usable. I ordered the newest extension kit which had the bigger skylight. The extension kit made a big difference in the amount of space added. The skylight allows as much space as a window. Like other reviewers have stated you need to have a level base prior to install. This will make the install go much quicker. There are shims to add in leveling so do not stress if you need to use one or two. Two people are not a must but sure makes it a lot easier especially on the roof and snapping the walls in place. It took me roughly 6-8 hours.  Overall very impressed so far and glad I order the extension kit. It is also a bonus you can add at least one more extension kit if you want/need at anytime. Very versatile. Would definitely buy again and I got fast friendly service from Competitive Edge at the best price. No damaged parts on delivery so a win win.

I just installed the Lifetime 6400 shed,Let me tell you what a good quality shed ,I had the rubber made shed before this and thought that was good but seeing this one blew it away. I installed over a sand base which made it difficult to snap walls to floor but if your planning a hard surface install this should make it easier. We had 3 people for install which helped since there was a slight breeze and 30 degrees out. Instructions where a little challenging but the shed is up so I guess it was not that bad. You will enjoy this investment. Had it in a weeks time no tax and no shipping.

An Excellent Product/Great Warranty!
Bottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. I bought this shed in August, 2005. The assembly was easy with the help of a friend. I have a self standing workbench, 10 inch table saw, drill press, free standing shelves and storage cabinets and still have plenty of room to walk around. We have some extreme high temperatures here in the summer. About two years ago the skylight seams opened allowing water to leak in. Replacements were [...] and installed easily. Recently I noticed that the corners had separated allowing me to see daylight through all four. An e-mail resulted in four aluminum angle pieces that snap in place on the exterior and seal the corners. This company stands behind their product with a ten year warranty. [...] My friend who helped me install it has since purchased one and is also very satisfied.

Great Product
Pros:"Useful","Sturdy","Easy assembly" Cons:"Hard to make level base","Corner tears" Bottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. We've had this shed for about 7 years and it's made three military moves, withstood Santa Ana winds, snow storms, rain and much more. It's been great and well worth the money. The only problems were getting a completely level surface to assemble it, and the corner pieces have started to tear after repeated disassembly and reassembly. Have to say it's been great, though.

Very Nice Shed
To start off we just built this shed on June 3, 2012. So not much usage yet. Instructions left a lot to be desired. But once you figured them out it was quite simple to install. We used a power drill with an adjustable clutch on low setting and it went together pretty fast. I installed it on an already existing concrete pad. Anchored it to the concrete like the instructions suggested. I can see the corners being a little weak in the long run. Very appealing. I had a total of 3-4 people helping build the shed. My buddy said as soon as his house is built he is buying one like it but bigger. Neighbors have expressed interest in one too. Wish it had more standard accessories that came with it. But will be ordering them here soon.

Excellent Product
Pros:"Easy to build" Cons:"Needs more accessories" Best Uses:"Storing Lawnmower","Storing tools" Bottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. This is a excellent storage shed. Directions were easy to read making installation simple. Did most of the work myself. I like the fact that you can add on to the shed to increase storage. Bought an extention to increase shed to 15 ft. Very happy with the results. Would buy again for future use.

 Q: We had an unusual amount of snow here this winter. How many inches of now can this shed handle?
 Asked by: Terry


 
			  - 2/27/2017

 A: The maximum roof load capacity is 23 pounds per square foot. On average a cubic foot of snow weighs 15 pounds, but if compacted it can weigh 20 pounds or more. If you usually get more than a foot of snow, you may want to get a shed with a specially designed snow load kit.

 Asked by: virginia

 Q: What material is recommended for the Foundation?
 Asked by: Customer


 
			  - 8/30/2016

 A:  This shed must be built on a flat level foundation of wood or concrete. 
				
 Was this answer helpful? 
				  

0 of 0 Customer(s) found this Answer helpful. 

Answer provided by:  Admin (8/30/2016) 
 A: The manufacturer recommends placing the shed on a flat structure such as a wooden foundation made of treated 2x4's and OSB board that you can pick up from your local home improvement store.  The instructions show just how to build it and what materials are needed.  The other recommendation is a concrete slab.  The concrete slab is more pricey to erect.  Some customers put it on cynderblocks, pea gravel, or other flat structures.  The important thing is to make sure it is flat and drains well.  If it isn't flat you may run into issues with your doors closing properly.  Feel free to contact us with any other questions.

 Q: Can I build this shed so that it is only 8' x 10' and just have extra pieces?
 Asked by: luke


 
			  - 8/27/2016

 A: That is not recommended because  the structural bracing and roof panels may not line up. If you need a 8' 10' Shed, then the 6405 is very similar and is the size you are looking for.

 Q: Are the metal parts Rust Resistant? How well will they stand up to coastal humidity and rain? 
 Asked by: Luke


 
			  - 6/2/2016

 A: The metal parts are not rust resistant per se. They have a powder coated finish to prevent rust, but eventually they will rust. Fortunately, the metal parts are on the interior of the shed. Also, there are replacement parts should any issues arise with rusting.

 Q: Does this keep out all bugs and will it be able to withstand the weather?
 Asked by: customer


 
			  - 2/20/2016

 A: This shed is well sealed off from the elements and insects, but it is an outdoor structure and will probably eventually get some bugs. The shed is water resistant, but not water tight, it should keep out snow and rain, but it should not be considered completely waterproof.

 Q: would two of these be able to attach so I could have one twice as long?
 Asked by: customer


 
			  - 2/20/2016

 A: No, they wouldn't be able to attach. The problem is with the back wall. You would need to order a lot of different parts since the roof and wall and floor panels have receiving ends for the wall.  They simply wouldn't fit together.  There are extension kits available, however. The model numbers for the extension kits are 6422 and 6424.

At Lifetime, we design attractive outdoor plastic sheds to help you get your act together. With one of our outdoor plastic sheds, you’ll be able to find what you need, when you need it. Our outdoor plastic sheds come with handy shelving units so your garden supplies at right at your fingertips. These Lifetime resin sheds are built and designed for style and quality. You’ll appreciate the spacious head room, windows, and skylights, as well as the no paint, no rust, low-maintenance of Lifetime’s resin sheds. Stain-resistant floor included. Constructed with high-density polyethylene plastic (HDPE) with steel reinforcements, Lifetime resin sheds are built to weather many storms. Make it easy on yourself; invest in one of our outdoor plastic sheds. Made in the USA. Covered by a 10 yr. limited factory warranty in the US and Canada. Compatible with our 8 ft expansion kits.Consult local building codes before assembly. This shed must be built on a flat level foundation of wood or concrete (not included). It is designed with a slight indentation in each corner of the floor so that you can drill through the flooring to secure it to the foundation. Anchoring hardware depends on the type of foundation you have and is therefore not included in the shed kit. Not including the installation of the foundation, you can expect assembly of the shed itself to take 2 adults up to 6 hours. Watch our helpful video on How To Build A Lifetime Shed.
