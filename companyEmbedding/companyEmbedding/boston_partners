Mar 23, 2017   Technical Product Manager Interview Anonymous Employee in Boston, MAAccepted OfferPositive ExperienceAverage InterviewApplicationI applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Boston Logic Technology Partners (Boston, MA) in February 2017.InterviewThe interview was straightforward, and more like a discussion than an interview. Had a couple phone conversations with the recruiting coordinator, and then was asked to come into the office once. I met with two directors/managers and it was a casual, laid-back conversation. I got to ask as many questions as I wanted, and wasn't asked any of the typical interview-y questions. Interviewers were extremely transparent and forthcoming, and didn't give any disingenuous responses.Interview Questions Do you have experience with APIs?   Answer Question Boston Logic Technology Partners 2017-03-23 10:36 PDTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Boston Logic Technology Partners Response seconds agoEdit • DeleteInter­views > Technical Product Manager > Boston Logic Technology PartnersRSS Feed RSS FeedEmbed iconEmbedDon't Miss Out On a Job You LoveUpload a resume to easily apply to jobs from anywhere.
