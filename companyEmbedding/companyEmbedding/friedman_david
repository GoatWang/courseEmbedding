Life and career[edit]
Friedman first became interested in entertainment after spending part of his childhood in Birmingham and Anniston, Alabama, traveling carnival sites. He worked as a film projectionist in Buffalo before serving in the US Army during the Second World War.
He met exploitation film pioneer Kroger Babb during his army service. This encounter got him interested in films. He then worked as a regional marketing man for Paramount, and sensed the money in independent distributing.
He started his own company in the 1950s, which mainly produced so-called nudie cutie films such as Goldilocks and The Three Bares, shot in nudist colonies, films that were the closest thing to pornography legally available at the time. This trend was followed by the sexploitation and "roughie" genres, depicting simulated sex with a more violent edge, often horror- or crime-related. Examples of Friedman's roughies are The Defilers (1965),[1] The Lustful Turk (1968), The Head Mistress (1968) and The Adult Version of Jekyll and Hide (1971, directed by Byron Mabe).[2] Helming one of those movies, Friedman started his working relationship with Chicago-based teacher and filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis.
Friedman went on to produce the latter's 1963 film Blood Feast, an American exploitation film often considered the first "gore" or splatter film. He was also the producer of two of the first Nazi exploitation films, Love Camp 7 (1969)[3] and Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS (1974), for which he wouldn't use his real name and was credited as Herman Traeger.[4][5]
With the advent of hardcore porn as a commercial factor in the mid-1970s, Friedman began to slow down his output. His motto was "Sell the sizzle not the steak" and he would not allow actual intercourse to be shown in his films. Still, he was president of the Adult Film Association of America, a trade association for hardcore porn producers.[6]
In the early 1990s Seattle's Something Weird Video, owned by Mike Vraney, started to re-issue much of Friedman's work on videocassette, getting him the attention of a new generation of exploitation and b-movie collectors. He can be heard on the audio commentary track of some of the company's releases. In 1997, Friedman appeared in a lengthy segment of the feature-length documentary Hollywood Rated "R" and in the half-hour documentary David Friedman, Portrait of an Exploiteer, in the both of which he goes over his entire career and the history of exploitation films in America. In 2000 Friedman was featured alongside cult filmmakers Roger Corman, Doris Wishman, Harry Novak and others in the documentary SCHLOCK! The Secret History of American Movies, a film about the rise and fall of American exploitation cinema.
In 1990 Friedman published his autobiography, A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King.[7] He remained proud of his cinematic oeuvre: “I made some terrible pictures, but I don’t make any apologies for anything I’ve ever done. Nobody ever asked for their money back.”
In 2001 he co-starred with longtime business partner Dan Sonney in the documentary Mau Mau Sex Sex (IMDb entry).
Friedman died in Anniston, Alabama on February 14, 2011 at the age of 87.[8]

Life and work[edit]
David Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.[4] He later earned a master's (1967) and a Ph.D. (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago.[5] Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.[6] He is currently a professor of law at Santa Clara University,[7] and a contributing editor for Liberty magazine. He is an atheist.[8] His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.
The Machinery of Freedom[edit]
In his book The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. This differs from the version proposed by Murray Rothbard, where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.[9]
He advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a cost-benefit analysis of state versus no state.[10] It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.
Non-academic interests[edit]
Friedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as Duke Cariadoc of the Bow. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East.[11] His work is compiled in the popular Cariadoc's Miscellany.[12] He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.[13]
He is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written two fantasy novels, Harald (Baen Books, 2006) and Salamander (2011).
He has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.[14]

Friedman first became interested in entertainment after spending part of his childhood in Birmingham and Anniston, Alabama, traveling carnival sites. He worked as a film projectionist in Buffalo before serving in the US Army during the Second World War.
He met exploitation film pioneer Kroger Babb during his army service. This encounter got him interested in films. He then worked as a regional marketing man for Paramount, and sensed the money in independent distributing.
He started his own company in the 1950s, which mainly produced so-called nudie cutie films such as Goldilocks and The Three Bares, shot in nudist colonies, films that were the closest thing to pornography legally available at the time. This trend was followed by the sexploitation and "roughie" genres, depicting simulated sex with a more violent edge, often horror- or crime-related. Examples of Friedman's roughies are The Defilers (1965),[1] The Lustful Turk (1968), The Head Mistress (1968) and The Adult Version of Jekyll and Hide (1971, directed by Byron Mabe).[2] Helming one of those movies, Friedman started his working relationship with Chicago-based teacher and filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis.
Friedman went on to produce the latter's 1963 film Blood Feast, an American exploitation film often considered the first "gore" or splatter film. He was also the producer of two of the first Nazi exploitation films, Love Camp 7 (1969)[3] and Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS (1974), for which he wouldn't use his real name and was credited as Herman Traeger.[4][5]
With the advent of hardcore porn as a commercial factor in the mid-1970s, Friedman began to slow down his output. His motto was "Sell the sizzle not the steak" and he would not allow actual intercourse to be shown in his films. Still, he was president of the Adult Film Association of America, a trade association for hardcore porn producers.[6]
In the early 1990s Seattle's Something Weird Video, owned by Mike Vraney, started to re-issue much of Friedman's work on videocassette, getting him the attention of a new generation of exploitation and b-movie collectors. He can be heard on the audio commentary track of some of the company's releases. In 1997, Friedman appeared in a lengthy segment of the feature-length documentary Hollywood Rated "R" and in the half-hour documentary David Friedman, Portrait of an Exploiteer, in the both of which he goes over his entire career and the history of exploitation films in America. In 2000 Friedman was featured alongside cult filmmakers Roger Corman, Doris Wishman, Harry Novak and others in the documentary SCHLOCK! The Secret History of American Movies, a film about the rise and fall of American exploitation cinema.
In 1990 Friedman published his autobiography, A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King.[7] He remained proud of his cinematic oeuvre: “I made some terrible pictures, but I don’t make any apologies for anything I’ve ever done. Nobody ever asked for their money back.”
In 2001 he co-starred with longtime business partner Dan Sonney in the documentary Mau Mau Sex Sex (IMDb entry).
Friedman died in Anniston, Alabama on February 14, 2011 at the age of 87.[8]

Life and work[edit]
David Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.[4] He later earned a master's (1967) and a Ph.D. (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago.[5] Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.[6] He is currently a professor of law at Santa Clara University,[7] and a contributing editor for Liberty magazine. He is an atheist.[8] His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.
The Machinery of Freedom[edit]
In his book The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. This differs from the version proposed by Murray Rothbard, where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.[9]
He advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a cost-benefit analysis of state versus no state.[10] It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.
Non-academic interests[edit]
Friedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as Duke Cariadoc of the Bow. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East.[11] His work is compiled in the popular Cariadoc's Miscellany.[12] He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.[13]
He is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written two fantasy novels, Harald (Baen Books, 2006) and Salamander (2011).
He has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.[14]

David Director Friedman (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and libertarian theorist. He is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, The Machinery of Freedom.[2] Besides The Machinery of Freedom, he has authored several other books and articles, including Price Theory: An Intermediate Text (1986), Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters (2000), Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life (1996), and Future Imperfect (2008).[3]

Life and work[edit]
David Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.[4] He later earned a master's (1967) and a Ph.D. (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago.[5] Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.[6] He is currently a professor of law at Santa Clara University,[7] and a contributing editor for Liberty magazine. He is an atheist.[8] His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.
The Machinery of Freedom[edit]
In his book The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. This differs from the version proposed by Murray Rothbard, where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.[9]
He advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a cost-benefit analysis of state versus no state.[10] It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.
Non-academic interests[edit]
Friedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as Duke Cariadoc of the Bow. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East.[11] His work is compiled in the popular Cariadoc's Miscellany.[12] He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.[13]
He is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written two fantasy novels, Harald (Baen Books, 2006) and Salamander (2011).
He has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.[14]

Mini Bio (1)


          David F. Friedman was born in Birmingham, Alabama. His father was a local newspaperman and his mother was a professional musician who played the piano and organ in silent-movie theaters and in churches. Friedman was exposed to the adult world at the age of four or five when his parents took him out "on the town" to restaurants, movies and stage shows. His father, already in his 50s when he was born, died when Friedman was 13. His mother re-married a few years later. After graduating from high school, Friedman was drafted into the US Army and served in Europe during World War II. After his discharge in 1945 he settled in Chicago, where he married and found work in filmmaking at Essanjay Films, where he knew co-owner Irwin Joseph, and they collaborated on making 8mm and 16mm underground sex hygiene films.During the 1950s Friedman worked for Paramount Pictures as well as Essanjay Films--which later became Modern Films--as well as the independent Apex Attractions in producing and working on a number of short pictures of the underground softcore set. Friedman met Herschell Gordon Lewis in 1960 while he was working in Chicago pitching for producers for his first low-budget film, The Prime Time (1960). He and Lewis formed a partnership, with Friedman in charge of obtaining production financing, to make what were known as "nudie-cuties", very low-budget, crudely made films featuring female nudity, which was not seen in "mainstream" films.Over the next few years Friedman and Lewis worked as mercenary filmmakers, with Friedman being the producer and sound man and Lewis being the director and cameraman. They made a series of softcore sex films, the first of which was The Adventures of Lucky Pierre (1961), then Daughter of the Sun (1962), Nature's Playmates (1962), Goldilocks and the Three Bares (1963), Boin-n-g (1963) and their first "roughie", a softcore sex film with some rather strong violence committed on the female characters, called Scum of the Earth (1963). Most of these films were shot on location in and around Miami, Florida, during winters when Friedman and Lewis lived there, away from the cold winters in Chicago.Wanting a change of pace away from the nudie-cutie exploitation genre, Friedman and Lewis worked together to produce Blood Feast (1963), which was filmed in Miami only a few days after filming their last nudie-cutie effort, Bell, Bare and Beautiful (1963). Despite many bad reviews and the low production values, "Blood Feast" brought in more money than they had gotten making "nudie-cuties", which soon led to their turning out Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964), followed by Color Me Blood Red (1965). After that Friedman ended his partnership with Lewis for a variety of reasons, both artistic and financial. Friedman moved to Los Angeles in 1964 to continue his production work there.In 1965 Friedman formed his own filmmaking company to make "roughies", and produced, co-wrote and co-directed The Defilers (1965), a low-budget exploitation film about two guys who kidnap and hold hostage a young woman "just for kicks". The film was a hit and restarted his career in the softcore field. A stream of more roughie and soft-core exploitation movies followed throughout the 1960s, which he produced, co-wrote and even acted in; some of these were A Sweet Sickness (1968), Casting Couch (1967), A Smell of Honey, a Swallow of Brine (1966), The Notorious Daughter of Fanny Hill (1966), The Brick Dollhouse (1967), The Lustful Turk (1968), among many others.By 1969 Friedman's career began to slide as the Hollywood film industry abolished the Hays Code and adopted the new Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating system in which independent and Hollywood mainstream filmmakers began producing X-rated, hardcore sex films, which soon swept aside the softcore roughie. Unwilling to get into the hardcore adult film industry, which was very profitable (but also very illegal), Friedman turned down several offers to direct hardcore sex films because he felt that it was "not as fun" as producing or directing the simulated roughie films. He continued to produce and direct a number of softcore sex films during the early and mid 1970s, such as The Adult Version of Jekyll & Hide (1972), The Erotic Adventures of Zorro (1972), Come One, Come All (1970) and the violent grindhouse vigilante flick Johnny Firecloud (1975).In addition to producing, Friedman also ran a theater in Los Angeles for several years which ran many of his exploitation films. Though producing exploitation movies was no longer lucrative, he occasionally dabbled in various independent productions in Los Angeles through the 1970s and into the 1980s. By then, Friedman more or less retired from film producing and re-settled back in Alabama, though he continued to come out of retirement to lend a hand at producing independent erotic or gore horror films, as he put it, "just for fun." Most recently was when he was reunited with Herschell Gordon Lewis in 2001 to produce Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat (2002), as well as co-produce a remake of "Two Thousand Maniacs!" that was titled 2001 Maniacs (2005).

Trivia (9)

      Coined the term "Mall-seleum" to refer to multiplex cinemas.


      After World War II, he bought some brand-new army-surplus searchlights and advertised them for sale. His first customer was the "king of exploitation", Kroger Babb. His meeting with Babb led to an association with the showman, especially with the producer's notorious roadshow attraction Mom and Dad (1945).


      Because of his film experience as a civilian, when he went into the army he was assigned to the Signal Corps, where he attended Army Film School and was trained in motion picture production, distribution and exhibition.


      His first jobs in the industry included a stint as a film booker at a Paramount exchange by day and a union projectionist and stagehand by night. These jobs were interupted by a draft notice during World War II.


      He was a partner in Modern Film Distributors.


      Lives in retirement since the early 1990s in his home town of Birmingham, Alabama. [February 2008]


      Owner of Entertainment Ventures Inc., a film production/distribution company.


      Unlike many of his fellow "exploitation" producers, Friedman came from a wealthy and prominent family--his father was a newspaper publisher in Birmingham, Alabama, and a close friend of US Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black.


      Started, with partner Dan Sonney, the Pussycat Theater chain of adult-film theaters. They sold it to Vince Miranda in 1968.


Personal Quotes (8)

      The whole idea of an exploitation film is to give people most of the show beforehand.


      I never wanted to produce or direct adult hardcore films, because my work ethic in exploitation is: "Sell the sizzle, not the steak".


      [His philosophy on such things as permits and licenses] When you ask for permission, you got a 50-50 chance they're gonna say "No.", and the other 50% is gonna be, "What do I get paid?"


      [Talking about the professionalism and reliability of Blood Feast (1963) star William Kerwin] He was what we called in the outdoor show business "good all-around show people".


      I have to admit I've made a pretty good living exploiting the lust, greed, and ignorance of the American public.


      I've got a high school education in making movies, but a PhD in selling them.


      I've exploited the basest human emotions, but the one I exploited most was loneliness. That's who was paying my way, a lot of very lonely men.


      I put the film in one end of the projector and out of the other end comes money.
