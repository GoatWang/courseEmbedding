I have nothing bad to say about this place! Nielson Physical TherapyAnnette D. ratedI first visited Nielson Physical Therapy years ago when I had neck problems and they were great! I am back after a couple of kids later for my back pain! They are great with helping me focus on techniques to alleviate strain on my back.

Thanks!Nielson Physical TherapyGeary4@comcast.net G. ratedFollowing knee replacement surgery, I went to Larry Nielson for therapy.  He was so kind and attentive, allowing me to have a good recovery.  The space is very attractive, featuring large windows, with views of nice green garden.  All of his staff is friendly and helpful.  This has been an experience.  Nielson Physical TherapySarah R. ratedBest in Fresno!I would choose Nielson over any therapist! VERY knowledgeable, attentive, courteous, and gets the job done right! The small atmosphere allows him to focus on your needs as opposed to the big places.... He helped me post rare knee surgery and I can say I was in the best hands possible!!
