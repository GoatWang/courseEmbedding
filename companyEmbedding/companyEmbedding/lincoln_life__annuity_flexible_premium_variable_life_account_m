No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved. They provide guaranteed¹ income for you and your loved ones regardless of market performance. And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Lincoln Annuities
	Lincoln Financial Group (the marketing name for Lincoln National Corporation) is a full-service financial company offering insurance, investment and fund management services. Its headquarters are in Radnor, PA. It offers annuities through its affiliates, the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and the Lincoln Life & Annuity of New York, which rank near the top in sales of variable annuities. The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company is one of the largest and most successful life-insurance companies in the U.S. The Life Insurance Market Research Association’s (LIMRA) annual survey declared it #1 in life insurance sales for 2007.

	In the third quarter of 2006, DALBAR ranked the Lincoln Financial Group Web site #2 in its quarterly ranking of customer-friendly Web sites. In 2005, the company ranked among the 100 best companies for working mothers for the 19th time in the previous 20 years, according to Working Mother magazine.

	History

	The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company began operations on June 11, 1905, in Fort Wayne, IN. Its 33 founding investors chose the name “Lincoln” in honor of President Abraham Lincoln, to denote dependability and honesty. Robert Todd Lincoln, the President’s only surviving son, gave permission for his father’s name and likeness to be used by the company. In 1931, the company started the Lincoln Historical Research Foundation. The Foundation opened a museum containing Lincoln artifacts, documents and memorabilia in Fort Wayne in 1931. The museum still exists.

	The company grew rapidly. By 1911, it had $6.5 million in life insurance in force. Between 1914 and 1940, it added an additional $250 million. Its growth rate between 1905 and 1955 was the largest of any American life-insurance company; by 1955, it was the 9th-largest insurance company in the country. In 1968, Lincoln National Corporation became the first U.S. insurance holding company. In 1973, the company began offering mutual funds and investment-advisory services.

	After 1990, Lincoln Financial Group dropped its property and casualty insurance lines and reinsurance operations. In 1995, it acquired the prestigious Delaware Investments to beef up its investment operation. As the century dawned, the holding company purchased the life insurance and annuity operations of CIGNA and Aetna. IN 2006, it merged with Jefferson National Pilot to produce the financial powerhouse of today.

	Lincoln Annuities

	Lincoln annuities include fixed, indexed, immediate and variable annuities. Its fixed-annuity product is a single-premium deferred annuity. Its three indexed fixed annuities include both single-premium and flexible-premium products. Its two immediate annuities, both single-premium products, include an inflation-indexed annuity. Lincoln Financial Group produces two suites of variable annuities, each containing 10 distinct variable-annuity products. (The company’s New York affiliate offers annuity products modeled on the foregoing, but with terms modified in accordance with New York law.)

	In 2008, the Morningstar Annuity Research Center ranked the company #1 in non-captive sales of variable annuities for the first half of the year. (Non-captive sales are executed by independent agents who are not bound exclusively to the products of one insurance company.)

	Financial-Strength Ratings of Companies Issuing Lincoln AnnuitiesThe four major ratings services rate the financial strength of Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York. According to the company Web site, those ratings are as follows:


		A.M. Best: A+ (2nd-highest of 16 categories)

		Standard & Poor’s: AA- (4th-highest of 21)

		Moody’s: A2 (6th-highest of 21)

		Fitch: A+ (5th-highest of 21)


	News

	On July 10, 2009, Lincoln Financial Group announced the successful completion of its $2.1 billion capital-acquisition program. The money was raised by issuing common and preferred stock and taking on debt. The group contributed $1 billion to the capital base of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. $950 million was obtained by issuing preferred stock to the federal government as part of the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase program, which is designed to promote economic growth.

	On June 25, 2009, the Federal District Court upheld a jury verdict on favor of Lincoln Financial Group in its patent-infringement suit against Transamerica Life Insurance Company. The suit involved the use of a computerized system for administering variable annuity accounts - specifically, those accounts containing products that offered guaranteed minimum payments combined with systematic withdrawal programs.

 American Legacy III

Supplement dated September 1, 2005
 to the Prospectus dated May 1, 2005

Please keep this Supplement with your current American Legacy III Prospectus and
retain it for reference. This Supplement replaces the discussion currently in   
your prospectus regarding the death benefits available under i4LIFE(R)          
Advantage. No action is required on your part unless you wish to elect the      
i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                                                            

Effective on or about September 1, 2005 (depending on state availability), the  
i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit will be available to   
owners of both qualified (IRA and Roth IRA) and non-qualified contracts who     
elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death 
benefit option is not available to existing contractowners if the Account Value 
death benefit was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) 
Advantage Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (EGMDB) is available to     
existing contractowners only if the EGMDB (or more expensive death benefit '    
option) was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                     

Once i4LIFE(R) Advantage begins, any prior death benefit election will          
terminate. The death benefit proceeds under the new death benefit may be less   
than the amount that would have been paid under the death benefit in effect     
before i4LIFE(R) Advantage began. The death benefit options described in this   
supplement are only available during the Access Period.                         

Effective Date                                                                  

If the benefit is elected after the contract is issued (by sending a            
written request to our home office), the benefit will be effective on the next  
valuation date following approval by us.                                        

Charges                                                                         

If you elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage, your Separate Account Annual Expenses (as a   
percentage of average daily net assets in the subaccounts) will be:

For a complete listing of charges, see Expense tables in the prospectus.        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account Value death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)Advantage Account 
Value death benefit is available for both qualified and non-qualified annuity   
contracts. This benefit is equal to the Account Value as of the valuation date  
on which we approve the payment of the death claim. The charge under this death 
benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.65% (or 2.15% if the Guaranteed Income  
Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the Account Value in the VAA. You 
may not change this death benefit once it is elected.                           

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)         
Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit is available for both qualified  
and non-qualified contracts. This benefit will be equal to the greater of:      

o the Account Value as of the valuation date we approve the payment of the      
claim; or                                                                   
o the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions          
where:                                                                      
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
            withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that withdrawals
reduce the contract or Account value.                   

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account Value may have a magnified effect on 
the reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals       
include deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.            

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.70% (or     
2.20% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage Guarantee of    
Principal death benefit may elect to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account  
Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the valuation
date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we will begin 
deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the change is 
effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of  
Principal death benefit.                                                        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. If you own a non-qualified annuity contract, you may 
also elect the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. (This benefit is not available with   
qualified contracts.) The benefit is the greatest of:                           
o        the Account Value as of the valuation date on which we approve the     
payment of the claim; or                                      
o        the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions   
where                                                   
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account value; or    
o        the highest Account Value or contract value which the contract attains 
 on any contract anniversary date (including the inception date)
    (determined before the allocation of any purchase payments on that
       contract anniversary) prior to the 81st birthday of the deceased. The
  highest Account Value or contract value is increased by purchase
      payments and is decreased by regular income payments and withdrawals
       subsequent to the anniversary date on which the highest Account Value
        or contract value is obtained. Regular income payments and withdrawals
      are deducted in the same proportion that regular income payments and
withdrawals reduce the Account Value.                         

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the Account Value may have a magnified effect on the         
reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals include   
deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.                    

Upon the death of any contractowner or joint owner who was not a contractowner  
on the effective date of the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB death benefit, the death 
benefit will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the death  
claim for payment (unless the change occurred because of the death of a         
contractowner or joint owner). If any contractowner or joint owner is changed   
due to a death and the new contractowner or joint owner is age 81 or older when 
added to the contract, then the death benefit for this new contractowner or     
joint owner will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the    
death claim subsequent to the new contractowner's death.                        

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.95% (or     
2.45% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage EGMDB may elect 
to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit or    
Account Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the  
valuation date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we  
will begin deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the
change is effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage     
EGMDB.                                                                          

General Provisions                                                              

For non-qualified contracts, upon the death of the contractowner, joint owner or
annuitant, the contractowner (or beneficiary) may elect to terminate the        
contract and receive full payment of the death benefit or may elect to continue 
the contract and receive regular income payments. Upon the death of the         
secondary life, no death benefit is paid.                                       

If you are the owner of an IRA annuity contract, and you die during the Access  
Period, the i4LIFE(R) Advantage will terminate. A spouse beneficiary may start a
new i4LIFE(R) Advantage program.                                                

The value of the death benefit will be determined as of the valuation date we   
approve the payment of the claim. Approval of payment will occur upon our       
receipt of all the following:                                                   

     1. proof (e.g. an original certified death certificate), or any other
proof of death satisfactory to us; and                    
2. written authorization for payment; and                       
      3. all required claim forms, fully completed (including selection of a
settlement option).                                       

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract to the contrary, the             
payment of death benefits provided under this contract must be made in          
compliance with Code Section 74(s) or 401(a)(9) as applicable, as amended from  
time to time. Death benefits may be taxable. See Federal tax matters in the     
prospectus.                                                                     

If the contract is continued, upon notification to Lincoln Life of the death,   
regular income payments may be suspended until the death claim is approved. Upon
approval, a lump sum payment for the value of any suspended payments will be    
made as of the date the death claim is approved, and regular income payments    
will continue. The excess, if any, of the death benefit over the Account Value  
will be credited into the contract at that time.                                

If a lump sum settlement is elected, the proceeds will be mailed within seven   
days of approval by us of the claim subject to the laws, regulations and tax    
code governing payment of death benefits. This payment may be postponed as      
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                

For both qualified and non-qualified contracts, following the Access Period,    
there is no death benefit.

Supplement to the Prospectus Dated May 1, 2005

This supplement describes two new features that are applicable to your variable 
annuity. No action is required on your part. Please refer to your product       
prospectus if you need further information on additional features of your       
annuity.                                                                        

The contracts - Surrenders and withdrawals. Beginning October 15, 2005, all     
surrender requests must be submitted on the Lincoln Life Surrender Form         
available from the Home Office. This form can be obtained by calling the        
toll-free customer service number listed in your prospectus, or by logging into 
your account at www.lfg.com.                                                    

The contracts - SecureLine(R) Account                                           

The SecureLine(R) account is a special service that we offer in which your death
benefit or surrender proceeds are placed into an interest-bearing account.      
Instead of mailing you (or the recipient of the death proceeds) a check, we will
send a checkbook so that you (or the death proceeds recipient) will have access 
to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the proceeds.   
The SecureLine(R) account is part of our general account. It is not a bank      
account and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As    
part of our general account, it is subject to the claims of our creditors. We   
receive a benefit from all amounts left in the SecureLine(R) account.           

If you request a lump sum surrender and your surrender value is over $10,000,   
your money will be placed into the account in your name. You are the owner of   
the account, and are the only one authorized to transfer proceeds from the      
account. You may choose to leave the proceeds in this account, or you may begin 
writing checks immediately.                                                     

In the case of a death of one of the parties to the annuity contract, if the    
recipient of the death benefit has elected a lump sum settlement and the        
contract value is over $10,000, the proceeds will be placed into the            
interest-bearing account in the recipient's name as the owner of the account.   
The SecureLine(R) account allows the recipient additional time to decide how    
to manage death benefit proceeds with the balance earning interest from the day 
the account is opened.

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

(a) Brief description of indemnification provisions.                  

  In general, Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company
   of New York provides that Lincoln New York will indemnify certain persons
   against expenses, judgments and certain other specified costs incurred by
 any such person if he/she is made a party or is threatened to be made a
  party to a suit or proceeding because he/she was a director, officer, or
    employee of Lincoln New York, as long as he/she acted in good faith and in
    a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or act
opposed to the best interests of, Lincoln New York. Certain additional
conditions apply to indemnification in criminal proceedings.          

 In particular, separate conditions govern indemnification of directors,
  officers, and employees of Lincoln New York in connection with suits by,
or in the right of, Lincoln New York.                                 

 Please refer to Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln New York (Exhibit
no. 6 hereto) for the full text of the indemnification provisions.    
 Indemnification is permitted by, and is subject to the requirements of,
New York law.                                                         

   (b) Undertaking pursuant to Rule 484 of Regulation C under the Securities
Act of 1933:                                                        

 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling   
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item
28(a) above or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the 
   opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,      
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
    liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
    or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in
    the successful defense of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
    securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of
  its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit
to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such      
    indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.             

Item 29. Principal Underwriter

 Annuities

	Enjoy your retirement





A good retirement income plan should generate two to three decades of sustainable income. It can help protect your assets from inflation, market volatility and savings withdrawal rates.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is an insurance product designed for retirement to help protect your financial future and guard against outliving your savings. An annuity pays you periodic income payments for as long as you live in exchange for a premium and it’s designed to be part of an overall retirement strategy. Annuity types offer different features and payment options to help meet your needs and priorities. Compare your options.
Annuities offer many additional benefits to help you prepare for the future, such as:  

No annual contribution limit
Ability to diversify and potentially grow your investments
Tax-deferred investment income until it’s withdrawn
Death benefit protection for beneficiaries
Optional riders (for an additional cost). Review our rider options.

To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated.
If you have questions or for more information on annuities, contact an advisor. 
Tax considerations
Annuities allow money to grow tax-deferred until clients begin taking payments. While consumers can’t control state and federal tax rates or policies they can take steps to help protect savings and income from tax erosion, and improve spending power in retirement. 

Find out why tax planning for retirement is so important.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Life‌ Insurance‌ Quotes‌ -‌ Help Your‌ Sense‌ of Security
 


Knowing that no matter what your loved ones will be taken care of is the ultimate sense of security. In the case of the unthinkable, you don't want your loved 
		ones left with not only the grief for the loss, but bills to only make it worse. Life insurance can ensure this doesn't happen.

In Tough Times, Why Spend Money on Life Insurance?
Out of all the major insurance types, life insurance quotes are often one of the lowest priced you will find. If money is tight for your family, imagine how much tighter it would be without you here. It's the responsible thing to do because none of us will live forever.
You Don't Have To Jump Through Hoops For Life Insurance.
You might think obtaining life insurance is inconvenient, but you have many options. You may feel you don't have the time for an exam or physical to be able to get coverage. There are many policies available that require few questions and no exams. Options can be quoted for you by licensed agents and compared at your convenience when you fill out our quick form to get your free life insurance quotes.

Now is the time to consider which type of life insurance will be best for your needs.
Reasons Life Insurance Is Important
For most people, financial difficulties force them to cut back on costs in various areas of life. Often, this can force you to live without the certain luxuries in order to prepare for the future. When you shop around for life insurance quotes online, you can make quote comparisons in order to find a policy that will take care of your family's financial needs. Life insurance is necessary for various expenses and you'll want to understand the many coverage options before you can decide how much coverage you'll need. For example, the death benefit will most likely be used for expenses like funeral costs, outstanding medical bills, education expenses, cost of living, and other financial obligations that will exist after your passing. When gathering information, it's important to realize the many types of coverage available before choosing a specific policy.
Life Insurance Options
Most people assume acquiring life insurance can be a tedious and challenging process. With USInsuranceOnline.com, it is easier than ever before.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
