Applied Physics


									Applied Physics 50 is an introduction to physics for engineering utilizing a team based and project based style of learning. Below are the six projects that I completed with six different teams for the class over the course of my freshman year.
								
Rube Goldberg Machine

To demonstrate learning of fundamental kinematics and energy, teams were required to construct a Rube Goldberg Machine that could crack an egg.
								
Symphosium


									The Symphosium project was geared toward material regarding the properties of waves. Each time was instructed to create an instrument that could be implemented in El Sistema, an organization that fights poverty with music. The instrument had many specifications, such as playing a full octave and being in tune within ~2 Hz. It also had to be extremely economical and easy to adapt to El Sistema. Our team chose to create a glockenspiel, an instrument similar to a xylophone.
								
Crack-a-thon


									The goal of this project was to implement the fundamental principles of electromagnetism and create a secure, but "crackable," safe. Our team used many components, including smart glass--glass that starts out opaque and becomes clear when a current is run through it-- and a robotic car that follows a black line via sensors. The safe is designed to keep a user stumped for at least 10 minutes.
								
Ecotricity


									The goal of this project was to implement the principles of electrostatics to solve an environmental problem. My team chose to use the concept of a precipitator to improve the function and efficiency of a catalytic converter
								
Mission to Mars


									Click to enlarge poster. This project was designed to showcase material regarding motion in a circle as well as encompassing kinematics and energy. As a team, we created a plan for a manned mission to Mars and mapped out a journey that involved leaving Earth, orbiting and landing on Mars, and returning to Earth (yes, we came back). We calculated energies, trajectories, as well as the time of the trip.
								
Spectrometer


									This project was geared towards waves and optics. Each team was required to build a spectrometer out of a box of given materials. The materials were quite basic, but included lenses and magnifying glasses. This spectrometer is capable of identifying one light source from 10 meters away and distinguishing three light sources from 5 meters away.

High School AutoCAD


									The following work was completed during my senior year of high school in an Advanced Engineering Design and Presentation course. I am certified in both AutoCAD and Inventor.
								

									Thank you to Mr. Frank Anderson, Instructor of Engineering Design and Presentation at the Byron Martin Advanced Technology Center, Lubbock, Texas.
								
Arbor Press


	                            	This is a mechanical representation of an arbor press, a machine commonly used to perform press fit work. All of the parts were individually designed and built to adhere to strict design specifications and standards. After the parts were built, the pieces were then assembled together and set into motion. The resulting animation is a movie representation of an arbor press at work. Built using AutoDesk Inventor.
	                            
Centering Attachment


									This is a mechanical representation of a centering attachment. All of the parts were built individually to exact design standards, and then each part was assembled to create the machine. An animation was produced to model the function of the machine. Built using AutoDesk Inventor. High school.
								
Tire Tread


									This is a physical representation of the tread of an irrigation tire. McWhorter Tire Co. of Lubbock, Texas, came to my high school's Advanced Engineering Design and Presentation class and asked us to design a tire tread in CAD software to be used in their production of irrigation pivot tires. After taking dimensions of a physical tire, I led a team of four in designing and recreating this tire tread. A rubber manufacturer now produces strips of these treads which are fused to old semi-truck tires to create a cheaper irrigation pivot tire that is used by farmers all over West Texas. Built using AutoDesk AutoCAD and Inventor.

Expository Writing 20

									When you enter your Expos classroom this fall or spring, you will be participating in one of Harvard's oldest traditions; a one-term course in expository writing has been the one academic experience required of every Harvard student since the writing program was founded in 1872. You will also be embarking on one of the most intensive classes you will take at Harvard. In no other class will you get to concentrate directly on the craft of composing and revising your ideas, and rarely will you receive as much personal attention from an instructor as you do in Expos. The Expos philosophy is that writing and thinking are inseparably related and that good thinking requires good writing. Although your instructor will critique the style of your papers in Expos, you will spend most of your time in class on strategies of argument--discovering and arranging persuasive ideas and evidence through a process of drafting and revising.
								
Culture and Belief 39 - The Hebrew Bible

									This course is a survey of the major books and ideas of the Hebrew Bible (commonly called the Old Testament). The course will also treat the historical contexts in which the Bible emerged, and the Bible's role as canonical scripture in Judaism and Christianity. All readings in translation. No prior knowledge of the subject is assumed.
