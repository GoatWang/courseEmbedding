WINNER: HALO ROVER




 
BEST HOVERBOARDS | 2017
 


1ST PLACE / Halo Rover


THE GOODThe Halo Rover								is an absolute beast that is taking the hoverboard community by storm. Its 8.5 inch rugged non-inflatable tires are
								able to take on any terrain with ease and is easily the safest board to own. It is fully UL 2272 Certified which
								means no fire or issues with the board. The reviews from customers have been very positive. It includes an APP and
								Bluetooth. What more can we say, we all have fell in love with the Halo Rover.
								

THE BAD Zip, zilch, nada...
THE BOTTOM LINE If you are looking for the safest and most reliable hoverboard it is the Halo Rover. The Halo Rover like all their products comes with a 12 Month Warranty. It is fully UL 2272 certified and is the most durable of the bunch.  Through our battery of tests the board we have concluded that this is the best quality board to be made to date and thus takes the Best Hoverboard Spot at #1.
 

What To Look For When Buying a Hoverboard
 
Battery
When it comes to searching for the right hoverboard start with the battery. Most of the lower end hoverboards are
									enclosed with cheap knock-off batteries that fail to operate the board properly. We at Best Reviews Online recommend
									to search for a hoverboard that has Certified Samsung or LG batteries. These batteries contain cells that contact
									heat and wont allow the battery pack to overheat at high temperatues. Few reputable hoverboard companies were judicious
									and spent extra dollars by building with quality Samsung Batteries.
 
Battery Cells & Quality
As consumers, our aim is to determine what peculiarities exist between models and brands that appear to be largely
									identical on the surface and sometimes sell at vastly different prices. Thus quality of hoverboards should be on
									the list. The search for hoverboards has become a difficult discovery in that it’s impossible to know exactly who
									is making what, which brands are in copycat mode and who is telling the truth. However, our recommendation is to
									first start with a company that has Certified Samsung Batteries. They uphold UL Certification standards and the
									extra battery seals protect the cells from any fire due to battery failure.
 
Warranty
We recommend to purchase a hoverboard from a company that doesnt shy away from providing a warranty. A 6 month warranty
									should be at play at the minimum to ensure you can still have technical assistance even months after your purchase.
									When looking to buy a hoverboard, make sure the warranty does cover most technicals issues an that might arise.
 
Not Recalled
It is an absolute must to now search for a board that is not on the recall list of the cpsc. While some of these boards were recalled initially most of these companies
									have gotten proper certificates and are now back on the market. It is important to note that UL has come out with
									a UL 2272 Certification for hoverboards so make sure to look out for hoverboards that are UL 2272 compliant.

THE BOTTOM LINE If you are looking for the safest and most reliable hoverboard it is the Halo Rover. The Halo Rover like all their products comes with a 12 Month Warranty. It is fully UL 2272 certified and is the most durable of the bunch.  Through our battery of tests the board we have concluded that this is the best quality board to be made to date and thus takes the Best Hoverboard Spot at #1.
 


2ND PLACE / Halo GO


THE GOODThe Halo GO								has made a name for itself as one of the most reliable and safest hoverboards on the market. It is fully UL2272 Safety
								Certified and has gone through a 156 point inspection test. They are enclosed with certified Samsung batteries in
								their hoverboards and includes a 12 Month warranty. Halo GO has hauled in the best reviews online and that can be attrituted
								to their stellar customer service and satisfaction. The Halo GO								is one of the few hoverboards today that include bluetooth allowing you to blast music to your board. Their sleek
								chrome designs and rubber protective padding are a majore plus that makes the Halo GO a safe buy 

THE BAD The only ding to the Halo GO is that it doesn't include an APP like the Halo Rover.
THE BOTTOM LINE They may be priced slightly higher than some models out there, but these are quality products, and one of the best hoverboards on the market, if not better. With a 10 mile ride range and hour charge time, you’ll never have to worry about having too much down time between rides. Through our hands on inspection, we found that every single Halo GO out their was made with quality parts and Samsung batteries. This could be the reason why we have never heard of a Halo GO to have any major issues and consumers are ensconced with the board. We have to agree with customers on this as we have ranked the Halo GO at #2 on our best hoverboard list.
 
 


3RD PLACE / Razor


THE GOODAlthough being hit with a recall with their original Hovertrax hoverboards, Razor bounced back with their new UL certified Hovertrax 2.0 boards that come with EverBalance technology. They do have a unique style and look to them which some prefer over the classic style of hoverboards. 

THE BAD Razor has been in the scooter business for years, but they had a bit of trouble with the big hoverboard recall that occurred last year, getting hit hard with their hoverboard offerings. They’ve built themselves back up with their new Hovertrax 2.0, and although its style is different, it’s also a bit polarizing, as many consumers just don’t like the look of it.  The battery life isn’t the greatest either, coming in at just an hour.
THE BOTTOM LINE Razor’s Hovertrax 2.0 is a great product that is powered by LG batteries and will get you a decent hour of ride time.  It’s not as impressive as the 1.5+ hour ride times of our higher ranked boards, but it still competes well.  If you can get around the strange design choices they went with, and the blemish on the company’s name with their recall, it is still a good hoverboard to buy.

When it comes to searching for the right hoverboard start with the battery. Most of the lower end hoverboards are

WINNER: HALO ROVER


 
BEST HOVERBOARDS | 2017
 


1ST PLACE / Halo Rover


THE GOODThe Halo Rover is an absolute beast that is taking the hoverboard community by storm.
								 First off, it is enclosed with a certified LG battery. Its 8.5 inch rugged non-inflatable tires are
								able to take on any terrain with ease and it's easily the safest board to own. It is fully UL 2272 certified which,
								means no fire or issues with the board. The reviews from customers have been very positive. It includes an APP and
								Bluetooth. What more can we say? We have all fallen in love with the Halo Rover.
								

THE BADZip, zilch, nada...
THE BOTTOM LINE 
								If you are looking for the safest and most reliable hoverboard, it is the Halo Rover.
								 The Halo Rover, like all their products, comes with a 12 month warranty.
								   It is fully UL 2272 certified and is the most durable of the bunch.
									   Through our battery of tests on the board, we have concluded that this is the best quality board to be made to date and thus takes the Best Hoverboard spot at #1.
 


2ND PLACE / Halo GO


THE GOODThe Halo GO
									has made a name for itself as one of the most reliable and safest hoverboards on the market.
									 It is fully UL2272 safety certified and has gone through a 156 point inspection test. They are enclosed with certified LG batteries in
								their hoverboards, and it includes a 12 month warranty. Halo GO has hauled in the best reviews online and that can be attributed
								to their stellar customer service and satisfaction. The Halo GO is one of the few hoverboards today that include bluetooth, allowing you to blast music to your board. Their sleek
								chrome designs and rubber protective padding are a major plus that makes the Halo GO a safe buy. 

THE BADThe only ding to the Halo GO is that it doesn't include an APP like the Halo Rover does.
THE BOTTOM LINE They may be priced slightly higher than some models out there, but these are quality products, and one of the best hoverboards on the market.
								 With a 10 mile ride range and one hour charge time, you’ll never have to worry about having too much down time between rides.
								   Through our hands-on inspection, we found that every single Halo GO out there was made with quality parts and LG batteries.
									   This could be the reason we have never heard of a Halo GO having any major issues and consumers are enchanted with the board.
										   We have to agree with customers on this as we have ranked the Halo GO at #2 on our Best Hoverboard list.
 


3RD PLACE / Razor


THE GOODAlthough being hit with a recall with their original Hovertrax hoverboards, Razor bounced back with their new UL certified Hovertrax 2.0 boards that come with EverBalance technology.
								 They do have a unique style and look to them, which some prefer over the classic style of hoverboards. 

THE BADRazor has been in the scooter business for years, but they had a bit of trouble with the big hoverboard recall that occurred last year, getting hit hard with their hoverboard offerings. They’ve built themselves back up with their new Hovertrax 2.0, and although its style is different, it’s also a bit polarizing, as many consumers just don’t like the look of it.  The battery life isn’t the greatest either, coming in at just an hour.
THE BOTTOM LINE Razor’s Hovertrax 2.0 is a great product that is powered by LG batteries and will get you a decent hour of ride time.  It’s not as impressive as the 1.5+ hour ride times of our higher ranked boards, but it still competes well.  If you can get around the strange design choices they went with, and the blemish on the company’s name with their recall, it is still a good hoverboard to buy.
 

4TH PLACE / Segway


THE GOODSegway has a great reputation for its customer service and creating quality products.  This Segway in particular is smooth and built to last.

THE BADIts biggest knock is that it's not enclosed with an LG Battery and instead has a standard Chinese battery. 

THE BOTTOM LINEIs it great quality? Yes, but
								that quality doesn’t come with an assurance of having a warranty just in case you have concerns with the product.
								Although it may be one of the most popular boards, it will never best the #1 hoverboard due to not being enclosed
								with LG battery cells.  
 


5TH PLACE / Sagaplay


THE GOODThe SagaPlay F1 hoverboard is an up and coming UL 2272 certified self-balancing scooter that is now available on Amazon.
								 It comes in three colors and sports a nice classic design and an LG battery.

THE BADWhile we like the classic styling and overall quality of the SagaPlay, it's still the new kid on the block and hasn't been tested for its durability over time. We will withhold judgement until more reviews come in.
THE BOTTOM LINE The F1 from SagaPlay is a great hoverboard for its listed price. There still aren't too many verified reviews for this scooter so it hasn't established itself yet,
								 and we couldn't rate it higher than the tried and true brands. If you are looking to buy a new hoverboard and don't want to break the bank, the SagaPlay is a decent choice.  

What to Look for When Buying a Hoverboard
 
Battery
When it comes to searching for the right hoverboard, start with the battery. Most of the lower end hoverboards are
									enclosed with cheap knock-off batteries that fail to operate the board properly. We at Best Reviews Online recommend
									 searching for a hoverboard that has certified LG batteries. These batteries contain cells that contact
									heat and won't allow the battery pack to overheat at high temperatures. A few reputable hoverboard companies were judicious
									and spent extra dollars by building with quality LG batteries.
 
Battery Cells and Quality
As consumers, our aim is to determine what peculiarities exist between models and brands that appear to be largely
									identical on the surface and sometimes sell at vastly different prices. Thus, quality of hoverboards should be on
									the list. The search for hoverboards has become a difficult discovery in that it’s impossible to know exactly who
									is making what, which brands are in copycat mode, and who is telling the truth. However, our recommendation is to
									first start with a company that has certified LG batteries. They uphold UL certification standards and the
									extra battery seals protect the cells from any fire due to battery failure.
 
Warranty
We recommend purchasing a hoverboard from a company that doesn't shy away from providing a warranty. A six month warranty
									should be in play at the minimum, to ensure you can still have technical assistance even months after your purchase.
									When looking to buy a hoverboard, make sure the warranty does cover most technical issues that might arise.
 
Not Recalled
It is an absolute must to now search for a board that is not on the recall list of the cpsc. While some of these boards were recalled initially, most of these companies
									have gotten proper certificates and are now back on the market. It is important to note that UL has come out with a UL 2272 certification for hoverboards,
									 so make sure to look out for hoverboards that are UL 2272 compliant.
