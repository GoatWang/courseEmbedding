Whitney R. Tilson and Glenn H. Tongue phone: 212 386 7160 Managing Partners fax: 240 368 0299www.T2PartnersLLC.com

February 28, 2010Dear Partner,Our fund rose 7.0% net in February vs. 3.1% for the S&P 500, 2.9% for the Dow and 4.3% forthe Nasdaq. Year to date, it’s up 5.3% net vs. -0.6% for the S&P 500, -0.5% for the Dow and-1.2% for the Nasdaq.The biggest driver of our fund’s performance this month was the 41.0% jump in General GrowthProperties, discussed below. Other winners included Borders Group (up 65.1%), Huntsman(12.6%), Resource America (11.0%), Sears Canada (10.0%) and Winn-Dixie (8.0%). Thebiggest mover in our short book was Palm, which reported terrible sales numbers and tumbled41.4%.

General Growth Properties

A bidding war has broken out for General Growth, as we expected. On December 16

th

, in ourfirst (of three) rebuttals to Hovde Capital’s bearish reports on GGP, we wrote:

Hovde completely ignores GGP’s value as a strategic asset to an acquirer, which is not atheoretical idea but a concrete reality as both Simon and Brookfield are circling right now. ForSimon, there would be big cost savings and, more importantly, revenue benefits: according to theWSJ article below, “Buying General Growth would make it by far the dominant player in theU.S. mall industry with more than 500 properties, giving it enormous clout over retailers in leasenegotiations.” As for Brookfield, it raised a $5 billion fund in the past year to make acquisitionsand GGP represents its last opportunity to break into the U.S. market in a big way. These are two

very

motivated potential acquirers. [page 9; all three rebuttals are posted atwww.tilsonfunds.com/GGP.pdf ] 

We continue to hold a large position in GGP because we think the downside is limited in light of the offers on the table and the upside could exceed $20 (the stock closed February at $13.11).Attached in Appendix A are three

Wall Street Journal

articles about the bidding war (alsoattached is our updated Privacy Policy).

K-1s

We are working hard, along with our auditors, Rothstein Kass, to finish the 2009 audit and K-1s.As soon as yours is ready (likely in late March), we will send it to you at this email address. If you would like someone (such as your bookkeeper) cc’d on the email, or would like us to fax itinstead, please email or call Kelli at KAlires@T2PartnersLLC.com or (212) 386-7160.

Simon Bids for General Growth

By KRIS HUDSON 


Mall giant Simon Properties Group Inc. on Tuesday announced it has offered $10 billion to
acquire struggling rival General Growth Properties Inc., possibly creating the largest U.S. ownerof high-end malls.General Growth also has been negotiating with Canadian real-estate concern Brookfield AssetManagement Inc. about Brookfield providing General Growth billions of dollars in capital toemerge from bankruptcy-court protection. The decision of whether to go with Simon orBrookfield is for General Growth's board to make, with the company's creditors and thebankruptcy judge getting a say on the final decision.Indianapolis-based Simon, which owns more than 300 U.S. malls, has offered to pay off GeneralGrowth's $7 billion in unsecured debt in cash or stock. Simon also would pay $6 a share toGeneral Growth's shareholders and the equivalent of $3 a share to pay its remaining obligationsto the heirs of billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes for a massive residential development in LasVegas. General Growth's stock closed at $9.40 on Friday in trading on the so-called Pink Sheets."Simon's offer provides the best possible outcome for all General Growth stakeholders," SimonChairman and Chief Executive Officer David Simon said in a statement released Tuesday."Simon is in the unique position of being able to offer General Growth creditors andshareholders full, fair and immediate value."General Growth representatives didn't immediately comment on the Simon offer. The Chicago-based company owns more than 200 U.S. malls. It sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection inApril 2009 after failing to refinance portions of its $27 billion debt as they came due.In a letter to General Growth's board sent Tuesday, Mr. Simon noted that he chose to make theoffer public after General Growth didn't respond to a formal offer that Simon made to itsexecutives and directors "more than a week" ago. Simon said it can finance its entire bid withcash and borrowing capacity it has on hand as well as with financial partners it didn't name.The deal, if accepted by General Growth's board and approved by its creditors and U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper, would combine two of the largest and oldest mall owners inthe U.S. into a colossus with 550 malls—at least a third of the entire U.S. market. Such heftwould give Simon unrivaled clout in lease negotiations with retailers and in financing talks withits lenders.
