Looking back at the more than 25 years that there has been a Cello, the endeavor has always had the same motto,
"The justification for a great music system is the same as for a great instrument: It makes possible a musical experience that cannot be duplicated by lesser means"
READ MORE...



Products
 The Cello product line is quite simple: one preamplifier, one power amplifier and one power supply. However, there is a great deal of flexibility possible.
The Chorale preamp can be delivered with, or without, a phono stage and can be configured as a microphone preamp for professional recording. The Encore amp can be configured in either a stereo or mono version. A single Master power supply can provide power to either a Chorale preamp or Encore amp individually, or provide power to both a Chorale and an Encore stereo amp simultaneously.

Matthew James International Pty Ltd

“I love Matthew James hair products and it was sad to see Price Attack no longer stocking them.  I am particularly keen on the styling lacquer but I see that Leon Brant charges $13.95 for the 500g can which is considerably more than I used to pay at Price Attack. I have been buying my MJ styling lacquer directly from Sunday Australia who kindly ship me a box (enough for a year!) with no shipping costs and at only about $9.00 per 500g can.”

Matthew James International Pty Ltd

“I live in North Queensland and have beautiful curly hair which I get bleached. However... Matthew James Rejuvenator was the only product that kept my hair at bay. Where I used to buy it from no longer stocks it and has told me that it has been moved to salons. I have looked and asked at every salon in my town and no one stocks it. Please, please, please can someone let me know what hair dressing salon chains stock this product. I can't wear my hair down anymore and it is breaking when I put it up in a pony tail. I will order the product in if I need to... It is the best product for my curly hair. I have spent a fortune trying to find a good product and now that I have it is no longer available to me. Please contact me at erin_milton@hotmail.com with any info. Thanks!”

Matthew James International Pty Ltd

“I lived in Australia, LOVED the Matthew James Revitalising Creme, and have moved back to the U.S. two years ago. I've used up all my product, and I'm desperate to buy more.  This is a fantastic product, great for the kids after swimming to ease the tangles and comb through easily, and I'm addicted to it because it smells so nice.  Would love to know how I can get it in the U.S. Anybody knows? email me at crabbyburton@optonline.net  Thanks!!!”

Hair & Beauty Salon Perth Circles Of Subiaco

“I was tired of having my usual straight long hair and I thought of doing a little makeover on my hair. I went to Subiaco and the hairstylist suggested that I should curl my hair to give emphasis on my face. I was hesitant at first but I was amazed at my transformation when she was done curling my hair. I look fab!”

Thanks Kate and the staff at Aberfoyle Park.”

“Hi, We all know how hard it is to get a really good hairdresser, after many years we try numerous hairdresser to find that after say five visits that do not keep up the same standard of the initital visit.  This sort of treatment gets very frustrating and we move on.  I have much pleasure and respect for the ladies at Scamps especially Kate Schirmer who for the past two years given me the best service and advice have ever had from a Hairdresser. She is honest, very knowledgeable and always ensures the customer leaves feeling they look their best and the style suits their age and type of hair.
Well done ladies more businesses need to ensure they have a really high quality service to present to the public.
Regards Cherie Furniss.”

Sounds of the Sixties' Brian Matthew hints at a comeback





































































Presenter Brian Matthew: " I'll be back on Radio 2 in the near future with something new"

Mark Harrison/BBC/Press Association















The much loved Radio 2 presenter Brian Matthew has hinted he could soon be back on the airwaves despite leaving the station yesterday.
Matthew said he is "saddened to leave" as he signed off as host of the long-running Sound Of The Sixties programme.
The 88-year-old presented the Saturday morning show for 27 years and the BBC faced criticism after it announced he would be leaving the station as a regular host.
The veteran disc jockey farewell episode featured a compilation of highlights from the programme's history.
As the last track played out, Matthew said: "That 1962 top five hit by Billy Fury brings me to the end of my reign as presenter of Sounds Of The Sixties and I must say I've enjoyed every minute of my 27 years in this chair.
"I'm saddened to leave but I'll be back on Radio 2 in the near future with something new, so keep your eyes open for further information.”
He added: "This is your old mate Brian Matthew saying that's your lot for this week, see you again soon."
Earlier this year, the broadcaster revealed a new voice would take his spot as presenter after Matthew suffered an "extended bout of ill health". He later hit out at the decision and labelled their comments "balderdash" in an interview with the Daily Telegraph.
Saturday's show closed with Billy Fury's Last Night Was Made For Love and also featured tracks Elvis Presley's Ghetto and The Beatles' She's Leaving Home.
Matthew's final appearance left listeners tearful and the BBC was slammed as "shameful" for jettisoning one of its most popular presenters.





Sad to be listening to the last ever Sounds of the 60s with the legendary Brian Matthew. I will miss the warmth of his voice.— David Traynier Ⓥ (@DTraynier) February 25, 2017







One listener, Bryce Lawrence, wrote on Twitter: "Shame on the BBC for ditching Brian Matthew time they gave listeners what they want."





Shameful treatment of Brian Matthew, SOTS and 3.4 million listeners.— J R Tyler (@Jrtyler) February 25, 2017






End of an era. Brian Matthew stands down from "Sounds of the Sixties." Another bit of our lives slipping away.— James H Reeve (@JamesHReeve) February 25, 2017

 The 88-year-old Radio 2 host Brian Matthew was axed against his will whilst he was off work recovering from a fall, but now he'll return to Sounds of the 60s for a series of specials and a farewell episodeBrian Matthew is to return to the airwaves on Sound of the 60s, after BBC bosses bowed to pressure to reinstate him.The 88-year-old Radio 2 host was axed against his will whilst he was off work recovering from a fall. But, in a victory for Radio 2 listeners, he has now been invited back into the studio to record a series of 'specials' including a farewell show.The BBC said in a statement: 'We are discussing a series of special Sounds of the 60s programmes with Brian which we hope to broadcast at Easter. Brian will have the opportunity to say goodbye to his listeners.'Mr Matthew told the Telegraph: 'They have now rearranged everything so I'm supposed to be recording another programme. It will be a farewell, as far as I' m aware.'A friend called me and said people were unhappy about me going, and that is so gratifying in itself.'The BBC was forced to give way after furious listeners threatened to boycott the station in disgust over the 'heartless' way Mr Matthew was treated.More than 5,000 people signed an online petition to get Mr Matthew back on air, and scores of fans contacted the Daily Mail in outrage.They lamented the loss of the DJ's 'mellow, unmistakable' voice, and the way he discussed sixties music as if 'from memory'.And they accused the BBC of ageism and 'underhand' behaviour, as it used a 'fairly minor health setback…to ditch him'.Mr Matthew got his marching orders whilst he was off work recovering from a fall.  





 Matthews (right on the show Thank Your Lucky Stars with Thelma Newton, John Davis and Janet Nichols) has been a staple on BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the 60sThe BBC claimed that it had mutually agreed that the veteran presenter needed 'to step off the treadmill of presenting the show' - but Mr Matthew said that was 'absolute balderdash'.'I was ready and willing and able to go back, and they've just said they are going to put the programme in the hands of other people,' he said in a furious tirade.But the veteran presenter is not the only Radio 2 host to be dismissed in a heartless manner.The station is now embroiled in a furious new row with its DJs, after bosses allegedly dismissed one of its longest-serving presenters without so much as shaking his hand.Alex Lester, host of After Midnight, had worked at Radio 2 for three decades when his show was dropped, along with all of the station's live overnight programmes.Instead of congratulating him on his years of loyal service, the station's managers did not offer 'the smallest word of thanks', the DJ's wife has claimed.Kerry Lester made the shocking accusations in a post on Facebook, as she criticised BBC managers for the cold-hearted way in which they dealt with his departure.'No-one in Radio 2's management team has seen fit to offer even the smallest word of thanks to Alex for 30 years of making BBC Radio 2 distinctive, informative, and entertaining during the hours of the night, albeit when none of them were awake, or bothered enough, to notice,' she said.  





 More than 5,000 people signed an online petition to get Mr Matthew back on air after he was fired'You'd have thought that someone in management might have invited Alex for a farewell drink, popped in to the studio to shake his hand, or, at the very least, dropped him a quick email to say thank you for everything he has done for the station for three decades.'The DJ – who goes by the on-air nickname 'The Dark Lord' - said he was 'absolutely heartbroken' to be dropped from After Midnight, and lambasted radio bosses for being out of touch with listeners.'Management exist in their own management bubble…they can only guess at what the audience is like. That is why I find it so heart breaking,' he told Radio Today, the industry magazine.Mr Lester also took a swipe at the BBC, suggesting that it undervalues its night time listeners.'A breakfast show listener is as important as a night time listener, especially with the BBC because they all pay the licence fee and so therefore they expect something from the BBC. If they pay the licence fee they deserve a service.'Radio 1 host Greg James leapt to the defence of Mr Lester and Janice Long, his 61-year-old After Midnight co-host who was also axed.'Janice and Alex are two of the very best broadcasters around…They sound like actual people on the radio not afraid to show their frailties and oddities and that's one of the hardest things to nail,' he said.Lewis Carnie, head of BBC Radio 2, has previously said that the station cut After Midnight as one of the 'extremely tough decisions' it has to make 'to reduce programming costs'. The corporation refused to comment on the accusations made by Kelly Lester.
