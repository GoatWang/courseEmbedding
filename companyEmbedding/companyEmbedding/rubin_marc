Background

About Marc


                            I've been developing software, systems, applications, and now websites for 30 years. Most of the companies I have worked for have been smaller ones (startups to 100 employees) and I've learned through good and bad examples and personal practice how to be successful.  As my career has progressed, I have been a software engineer, project manager, product manager, architect, VP of technology, CTO, CIO, and COO as both an employee and consultant.   

I have a CS degree from Clarkson University from the days when the focus was on algorithms, architecture, performance, quality, reliability and programming mechanics. I use all of these skills and more to build superior solutions. I've transitioned from larger systems to websites, eCommerce, and eLearning (award winning). 

My preference is to join someone, or a group, that has some seed money, or beyond, but I can also build an MVP. My role(s) could (should) include technology, product management, strategy, customer service and support, finance and everything else that comes about in a startup.  While I currently can build websites and systems of all kinds, I do not code mobile apps YET.  I have managed mobile app development.

I have not yet before founded my own startup.  Instead I have joined others as an employee and for such roles as CTO, CIO, COO, VP Technology.  Titles aren't important, results are, and I deliver results.

Please reach out to me and we can discuss what you are building and how I can help.  To read more about me and the technology I last used, you may view my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcr63

Best,

Marc
                        



Quote


                            Making a well thought out, yet potentially wrong, decision quickly which can be used to learn and build on is far better than wasting time and not making any decision in a timely manner. - The quickest way to know whether right or wrong is to begin.  You'll know much faster whether you're right, or need to try Plan B, C, ... - Marc

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
