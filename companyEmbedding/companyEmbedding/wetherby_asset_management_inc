Jennifer A. Ayer
Wealth Manager



I moved from New York to San Francisco in 2011, and definitely feel like I’ve found a home here at Wetherby.  What I found most appealing about the firm was its independence, long history and client service orientation.  The people here have a strong work ethic and commitment to teamwork.  What I love about this business is that it allows me to guide families through major life decisions and to create strategies that align with their goals.  I have experience working with multi-generational families who have complicated trust structures and then guiding them to establish a shared mission and value proposition.
Experience summary
Jennifer combines experience in wealth management, fixed income and private equity with a passion for impact investing.  Prior to joining Wetherby she was a partner and managing director at Venture Investment Associates, a private equity fund of funds, where she worked with high-net-worth families and foundations.  Earlier, she was marketing director for Samson Capital, a fixed income investment company primarily serving families.  She started her private client advisory career at UBS, followed by seven years as a senior private client advisor at Wilmington Trust.  After moving to San Francisco, she began volunteering at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), consulting with them on bringing outside partners into their care model.  Helping families connect their goals of wealth planning and investing, with their social causes is something Jennifer is especially committed to.  She is a member of the Full Circle Fund, an active network of professionals who leverage their time, talent and connections to help nonprofit organizations influence positive change in the San Francisco Bay Area.  She is also a volunteer and supporter of Raphael House, which serves at-risk families, helping them achieve stable housing and financial independence.

Bong Choi
Director of Research



I’m proud to join Wetherby at a key point in the firm’s growth. My role is to oversee the internal Research Team, which supports the investment direction of the firm. Wetherby’s diverse and collaborative investment process is a real strength, and my priority is to integrate the role of the research team with our clients’ portfolios. We center on analytic rigor, while being a successful source of investment ideas and recommendations for our clients. I see research as being totally in line with Wetherby’s reputation for trust and integrity.
EXPERIENCE SUMMARY

He started his career as a mergers and acquisitions analyst and eventually progressed to chief investment strategist for a $4 billion dollar asset management firm. After two post-college jobs performing quantitative analyses in New York and Boston, respectively, he entered Harvard’s MBA program. He moved across the country to the Bay Area, joining a small team at Capricorn Management responsible for the investment strategy of a large single family portfolio. Bong followed that with a stint at Wellington Management in Boston as a buy-side research analyst within the firm’s real estate group. He returned to the West Coast in 2008, eventually becoming a partner and chief investment strategist for Stamos Capital Partners, an investment firm managing diversified portfolios on behalf of family offices and institutions.

I focus on estate planning strategy for our clients, which complements our work in financial planning and portfolio management.

I’ve really enjoyed bringing my legal viewpoint and knowledge to my work at Wetherby, and I have gained invaluable experience in wealth planning and management. It’s a pleasure to work with colleagues who value long-term thinking and diversity.

David Ferguson, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder 



I don’t have a typical background for someone in the financial services industry, but I definitely feel I’ve been able to apply my client service background at Wetherby. I started my career in transportation at a global container shipping firm. But even before that, I drove a bus at the University of California, Davis, while I was in college. It helped me pay for college, plus one of my fellow bus drivers later became my wife! My experiences prior to joining Wetherby gave me the ability to talk comfortably with people who have varied backgrounds and interests, the chance to help build a startup into a major international operation and a deep understanding of what customer service really means. One of the most interesting experiences I’ve had here is to help one of our clients establish a charitable account funded with cows. I really love collaborating with our clients.
Experience summary
Before his start at Wetherby in 2007, David was Director of Global Operations for International Asset Systems. He built an international customer service team that served the container shipping industry from offices in the United States (Oakland, CA and Chicago, IL), as well as Hong Kong and Nice, France. He became a Wetherby shareholder in 2014.


Career highlights

While in college, was chosen to compete in a national bus driving competition (Roadeo) and won the top award for the region

Early in my career, I worked in marketing retail and institutional investment products.  I learned a lot about different investment styles and vehicles during this part of my career.  It was a valuable experience, but I also learned that I preferred to advise individuals and help them develop their financial plans.  I decided to study for a Certificate in Financial Planning, and I worked during the day and took the courses at night.  I love being a financial planner and investment advisor.  I’m able to integrate what I learned in school with my life and work experiences.  I’m happy when I can help find solutions that respond to a client’s unique circumstances and share ideas that the client may not have thought about.

Mike Graziano, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I love being able to take a comprehensive view of my client’s financial picture – not only what is happening now but what could happen in the future. This ranges from charitable giving to retirement planning, from insurance to estate plans. I’m especially passionate about tax planning: creating tax-efficient investment portfolios and trying to achieve tax optimization over a multi-year time period. I also mentor some of our junior staff. There’s nothing more gratifying than seeing someone with drive, attention to detail and a passion to learn develop a successful career.
Experience summary
Following a four-year stint in the U.S. Air Force, Mike became a staff accountant at Given & Associates, a small CPA firm in Colorado. In that role, he prepared tax returns for individuals and compiled financial statements for small businesses. Subsequently, he moved to San Francisco and started at Wetherby in 2000.

Christopher Hauswirth
Wealth Manager, Director of Alternative Investments and Shareholder



I was one of the earliest members of the Wetherby team. There were only about six of us when I joined, and what appealed to me was the firm’s independence. We were early pioneers of the concept, and we grew in a steady, purposeful way. We love it when prospective clients really want to dig in and learn about us – to do thorough due diligence and to ask tough questions. The best thing a client could say to us is, “I trust Wetherby completely.”
Experience summary
Chris has worn several different hats during his long tenure at Wetherby and is currently a Wealth Manager and the Director of Alternative Investments. In that latter role, Chris oversees the firm’s non-traditional investments, such as hedge funds, private equity, real assets and special situations not traded in the public markets. As a Wealth Manager, Chris sees his role as reducing the complexities of the financial world and making it more digestible and understandable for his clients. He also supports Wetherby’s asset allocation and strategic investment process. Immediately prior to joining Wetherby in 1998, Chris co-founded and ran Hauswirth & Dunn Investment Management. Previously, he was vice president and head of the financial advisor division at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco. Chris has participated in number of community organizations and is currently serving on the Board of Trustees at the Katherine Delmar Burke School, where he also chairs the Investment Committee.

Steve Herzog, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I have been lucky enough to travel, live, study, volunteer and work professionally in many regions of the world. I really enjoy taking what I’ve learned working with individuals and corporations in many different circumstances and cultures and applying it to help my clients solve problems. Here at Wetherby, I advise a number of large multi-generational families, and I partner closely with them to help them attain their personal, philanthropic and legacy goals.
Experience summary
Prior to joining Wetherby Asset Management in 2005, Steve ran his own hedge fund following an earlier stint as a hedge fund portfolio manager and analyst. Prior to that, Steve was a vice president at JP Morgan. There, he held a number of corporate finance and private client advisory roles in New York, London and San Francisco, advising corporate clients and wealthy families in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Steve now provides customized portfolio management and advice on diversification, tax, trust and estate planning strategies for his clients. He serves on the firm’s Investment and Asset Allocation Committees and is a member of the Financial Planning Association of San Francisco. Additionally, he serves on the Board of Directors for Environmental Traveling Companions, which provides outdoor adventures to people with disabilities and disadvantaged youth.


Career Highlights

Jennifer K. Hicks
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I thought I was going to be a professional volleyball player. I got a full scholarship to play at a Division I school, but an injury forced me to get a “real job.” Joining Wetherby was the perfect opportunity, because what appealed to me about playing for a college team had many of the same ingredients as working here. Plus, the firm is led by a woman – Deb Wetherby – and she’s not only a role model but has cultivated the values that are important to me.
Experience summary
Jen was able to do internships with AG Edwards and a CPA firm prior to joining Wetherby in 2007, and these experiences were useful when she stepped into an operations specialist role. Soon after, she began to work directly with clients and, after three years, she became an investment associate. Jen was promoted to wealth manager and became a Wetherby shareholder in 2015. She views the best way to provide value is to think holistically, and her experiences in operations and investment planning are useful every day in her client interactions. Outside the office, Jen serves on the committee that plans the annual conference for the Financial Planning Association of Northern California, considered one of the premier financial planning events in the U.S.

ABOUT ME

Just bought my first home with my husband, Trevor, who also works at Wetherby
Coach volleyball teams and continue to play for fun
Enjoy traveling, and my husband and I try to explore at least one new destination each year, highlights include Bora Bora, Germany, The Netherlands and Argentina

I JOINED WETHERBY BECAUSE
I connected with the team atmosphere and immediately felt at home.


	  		“The best compliment I can get from a client is, ‘You’ve taken care of me.’”	  	


 



 

Trevor Hicks, PMP®, CISSP®, CISM
Director of Technology



The best way for me to describe a typical day at the office is “grab bag.” What I like about my job is that it allows me to be creative, strategic and tactical. On the creative side, for example, I’ll research and review different technology solutions that may be appropriate to solve a problem and I’ll evaluate the costs and benefits of each. On the strategic side, I consider our firm’s goals and assess what technologies we can use or maximize to accomplish them. And on the tactical side, my day may start with an email first thing in the morning that can define the rest of my day! My clients are all the Wetherby employees, and ultimately our clients. So it’s important to think about what I can do every day to add value to each of them. My goal is to move from a role as the “tech gatekeeper” to a colleague who really empowers others to master technology.
Experience summary
Trevor began his career at a Bay Area biotech firm, diaDexus, and spent 12 years there with increasing responsibilities and varied assignments. He was promoted to lead the company’s IT group. He then joined Aechelon Technology as a senior system administrator, followed by a stint with Accenture as Global IT Lead. He started at Wetherby in 2013.


Career Highlights

Was selected as one of three contestants, from a pool of 8,000, to compete in a technology reality show produced in Los Angeles
Had the opportunity to work at the Google campus, while employed by Accenture
Developed proprietary systems relating to patient information and medical records while at diaDexus

Education and professional certifications

About me

Enjoy walking to work every day and exploring the city of San Francisco with my wife
Even though I’m 6’8” tall, I’m terrible at basketball.  I do enjoy fencing, ice hockey and golf
Will take almost any opportunity to try something new – learning really drives me
Have begun to try my hand at gardening and even built a planter box for artichokes

I joined Wetherby because
I thought my IT experience could make a significant contribution here, and I was excited to join a firm that has a family-like atmosphere.


	  		“I’d never experienced a family-like office culture before. It’s refreshing and energizing!”

Stephen Janowsky
Chief Operating Officer and Shareholder



When I arrived at Wetherby in 2005, I was struck by its orientation toward client service as opposed to sales, and by the unique culture. It’s a firm with a heart, which comes from our leader and a focus on doing good while doing well. I think there’s an advantage in not having spent my career in financial services. I’m not tied to a specific sector, but instead I can think about our firm with a broad business perspective. I can look at operations, business development and other functions, for example, and think about what processes and policies we need to support our future plans.
Experience summary
Steve collaborates with Wetherby’s leaders to provide guidance and oversight in numerous firm areas, including client services, internal firm operations, administration, human resources, finance and business planning. He joined Wetherby as chief administrative officer and was promoted to chief operating officer three years later. Prior to joining the firm, he led North American operations at Proxicom, a boutique consultancy. Steve began his career at Ernst & Young, where he focused on identifying process and operational improvements for numerous corporations. Steve is active in a number of community organizations – he currently serves as President of the Larkspur Schools Foundation and as an honorary Director on the Board of Larkin Street Youth Services.


Career Highlights

Participated in a change management project for Ernst & Young in Mexico, getting exposure to the implications, both cultural and logistical, of a merger
Opened the Los Angeles office for Proxicom (literally building the office from the ground up), and later managed all the company’s North American offices
Was able to contribute to Wetherby’s success, while we expanded our staff and tripled assets under management over a 10-year period

I joined Wetherby because
I was impressed with the people and excited about the opportunities here.

I have a broad base of experience across a range of asset classes. I’ve worked in global and international equity brokerage roles, fixed income and real estate asset management and wealth management. I’ve had many leadership and management responsibilities. A big reason for my interest in joining Wetherby was Deb and the firm she created. I led the recruiting and training program at Morgan Stanley where she was one of 13 MBAs we hired that year for the private client services group.
Experience summary
Skip, who established the Wetherby New York office in 2004, advises clients on customized investment and financial planning strategies.

Between his two “tours of duty” at Morgan Stanley, he was a managing director and management committee member at OFFITBANK, a private trust bank specializing in fixed income asset management. Later, he was a managing director and principal of European Investors, a real estate securities asset management firm. Skip started his career at Goldman Sachs and was a founder of the restricted stock group in its Institutional Equity department.  He’s active in the community, serving on the Board of Directors for St. Mary’s Healthcare System for Children and the American Jewish Historical Society.  He chairs the Investment Committees of both organizations.  Skip is also an independent director of Harding Loevner Funds, Inc., a mutual fund complex.

	  		“I’ve had the chance to work with several top-tier investment firms during my 45-year career, and the no-conflicts model here was extremely important to me.  It’s the best model because clients always come first.”

Wetherby’s size and stature, along with our increased commitment to impact investing, offer a powerful platform through which I can better serve current and prospective clients with investments that generate positive social, environmental and financial returns.
Experience Summary
Before joining Wetherby in 2015, Justina was a Director and Senior Investment Analyst at Sonen Capital, a San Francisco Bay Area-based impact investing firm. In that role, she led the development and implementation of impact investment strategies across the private markets and supported the launch of a fund focused on global sustainable real asset opportunities.

Karen Leech, CPWA®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I see myself as a navigator, in a sense, guiding clients through the many different planning stages of their lives and making sure their investment strategies align with their personal goals. I provide caring, comfort and good advice through transitions like retirement, divorce and loss of a spouse. It’s important for me to stay on top of what’s going on in clients’ lives, to listen, to make sound recommendations and to be available when they need to talk. I also have a keen interest in finding ways to have a positive social impact, and I’ve worked with a number of clients to develop and implement an impact investment strategy.
Experience summary
Karen began her professional career in the United Kingdom, initially working with two big insurance companies and later as a financial advisor for Compton House Financial Management. Compton House originally had been part of a law firm before the law and financial segments were separated. The skills that were invaluable for a law firm, such as careful documentation and compliance, helped grow her capabilities as a wealth manager. After relocating to the United States, Karen soon found herself as one of Wetherby’s small but growing team of professionals. In 2004, three years after arriving at Wetherby, she became a shareholder. Karen supports a core group of clients and combines her attention to detail with listening and problem-solving skills. She contributes to the firm’s client service and communications activities; she is also active in the Financial Planning Association of San Francisco, having previously served on the Board of Directors as its Treasurer. Karen currently sits on the Investment Committee for The Redwoods, a nonprofit senior retirement community in Mill Valley.


Career Highlights

Joined the firm in 2001 and consider myself fortunate to have been mentored by Deb Wetherby
Got first-hand experience with a major business transition when Compton House separated its financial advisory services from its law practice

I joined Wetherby because
It’s a firm that places clients above all other interests.

John K. Mell III, CFA, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



My role is to advise clients on customized investment strategies, portfolio construction, as well as complex retirement, trust and estate planning.  What I love about my work is that it combines logic and problem-solving skills with a focus on helping people.  Since moving to our New York office I’ve enjoyed the opportunity to share the Wetherby story with people unfamiliar with our culture and values.  We have a uniquely client-centric and service-oriented approach relative to most wealth management firms, and I love to tell others about it.
Experience summary
John began his career as a Wetherby associate in its San Francisco office in 2004 where he worked with a variety of individual and non-profit clients. He was promoted to Wealth Manager three years later, in 2007. John moved to New York City in 2010 to work with the firm’s East Coast clients and help manage Wetherby’s office there. He’s a board member of Project Explorer, a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Financial Planning Association of New York, and was formerly president of the UVA Club of San Francisco.

About me

Moved to California after graduating from college with a lot of hope – but no job
Took a two-week backpacking trip in northern Alaska
Speak some Russian – the result of taking classes and spending a semester abroad during college

I joined Wetherby because
I connected with the people here. I was young and knew there would be opportunities for me to learn as much as I could handle. I figured that a lot would be asked of me and I wasn’t intimidated by the challenge. I’m still here because there’s still so much to learn and so many more challenging investment and client situations to tackle.


	  		“There’s no ‘formula’ for Wetherby’s client service approach.  The best way I can describe our philosophy:  we serve clients the way they want to be served.”

Jack Olson, CPA, CFA, IACCP®
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Shareholder



I really enjoy working for mid-size and small organizations, in part because I’m able to wear many hats and in part because I really get to see the fruits of my labor. On the finance and compliance side, I focus on following guidelines, minimizing risk and ensuring compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. On the operations side, my role is to oversee the back office functions – essentially all the transactions, filings and documentation. I’d say I knew from an early age that I wanted to have a role in accounting and finance – my father and brother are both CPAs.

Andrew Pratt, CFA
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I joined Wetherby in 2006 with nearly 30 years of investment experience in several different settings including equity research, trading, portfolio management and asset allocation. As my career moved towards portfolio management over time, my focus became more “big picture” oriented, and I found the transition enjoyable.  Wetherby manages globally diversified, multi asset class portfolios and so my experience is quite relevant both in terms of our investment decision making and in describing the market and economic environment to clients. My 10 years at Wetherby have allowed me to add experience in working with clients on a variety of issues in addition to investing.

He began at the institutional trading desk for Fidelity Investments’ capital markets group, followed by a corporate role at Hewlett-Packard. These experiences confirmed his desire to be an investment analyst, and he then took a position at Montgomery Asset Management.

Simon Smundak, CFA
Senior Research Analyst and Shareholder



Back in 2006, I was working in the hedge fund industry, had taken the final part of my CFA exam and had just gotten married. Two weeks after the wedding, my wife and I took a year off to travel the world. It gave us the opportunity to spend time together, and it helped me clear my head and decide what I wanted to do next. Travel can be a bit uncomfortable and unsettling, but to me that’s what makes it so positive. I would definitely consider this experience a highlight of both my personal and professional life. I’d wanted to return to California, which is where my family settled after coming to America from Estonia. I also hoped to broaden my experience from hedge funds to a wider range of asset classes, plus I wanted to have a closer relationship with clients to help them achieve their financial goals. Wetherby gave me the opportunity to do both. My focus now is to evaluate and recommend non-traditional investments that can be integrated into our clients’ portfolio planning.
Experience summary
Simon started as an intern at Cadogan Management, a privately-owned hedge fund of funds firm, while he was still in college. Upon graduating, he became a full-time research analyst.  After his first year, he was offered an opportunity to support an in-house equity hedge fund, Arbiter Partners, led by Cadogan’s chief investment officer. After four years there, followed by one year of travel, Simon moved to San Francisco and joined Wetherby as a Research Analyst in 2008. He was promoted to Senior Research Analyst in 2011. He supports Wetherby’s investment, asset allocation and manager selection processes. Simon is a Chartered Financial Analyst® charterholder and is a member of the CFA Society of San Francisco.


CAREER HIGHLIGHTS

Started at Cadogan Management when the firm had $400 million under management; four years later, we were managing more than $2 billion
Have been able to expand my expertise from hedge fund research into a wider array of asset classes, giving me more intellectual challenges and professional growth

Education and Professional Certifications

B.A. in Economics from New York University
Chartered Financial Analyst® charterholder
Member of the CFA Society of San Francisco

ABOUT ME

Was born in Estonia, have lived in California and New York, and have traveled to 33 countries throughout the world
Am married and we have two daughters; our entire family enjoys traveling!
Enjoy biking through various parts of Northern California, cooking, reading and music (including playing the drums)

I JOINED WETHERBY BECAUSE
Deb Wetherby valued the fact that I had spent a year traveling and soul-searching. I think that says a lot about the firm’s culture and the value that’s placed on learning and taking on new challenges.


	  		“There is definitely a ‘clients come first’ attitude here at Wetherby.  Being responsive and sensitive to our clients’ needs has really resonated with me.”

Debra Wetherby, CFA, CFP®
Chief Executive Officer, Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I love quotes and started collecting them when I was in elementary school. One I’ve found particularly inspiring is: “If the path before you is clear, you’re probably on someone else’s.” I believe success starts with finding out what is meaningful to you, and then centering your business, goals, plans and intentions around that. When I started our firm, “traditional” investment managers used a fee structure that incentivized selling, but I wanted to build a business with values centered on exceptional service. Objectivity, integrity and thoughtfulness are what I want to reward. What I’m most proud of is not the amount of money we manage or our profits – it’s our team, our culture and how we care for our clients.

Kyle A. Winterbotham
Investment Advisor and Shareholder



My grandfather was a stockbroker and a role model. He taught me about the stock market, and I thought I’d follow in his footsteps. When my roommate told me I should consider applying at Wetherby, I wasn’t sure because I’d always seen myself as a broker. But once I met the people here and started thinking about the opportunities, I decided it would be a good fit. I understood the financial markets but I had a lot to learn about wealth management. I listened, learned, earned others’ trust and got more and more responsibility. Joining Wetherby was one of the best decisions I ever made.
EXPERIENCE SUMMARY
Kyle started as an associate in client service operations in 2006. Over time, his role evolved and is now a “hybrid,” integrating his skills in investments and research with client service support.  The importance of this new role was acknowledged in 2015, when Kyle was named a shareholder.  He coordinates between Wetherby’s operations group, wealth managers and clients, and he sees the mix of analytical work – collecting and interpreting data – and client service as a perfect blend.  He also contributes to many of Wetherby’s computer systems-based initiatives and enjoys training and mentoring new associates.


cAREER HIGHLIGHTS

Being one of Wetherby’s first employees to be promoted from operations to investment associate

Impact Investing Overview

Wetherby can help direct your capital to do more than generate financial returns.We have seen a growing number of clients who want their investments to combine social responsibility and sustainability with competitive returns. Wetherby has been advising clients on impact investing for over ten years. We develop mission-driven investment strategies and detailed execution plans.


What?
“Impact Investments are investments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.” (The Global Impact Investing Network)



Why?
Impact investing offers clients the opportunity to advance social and/or environmental goals while generating financial returns; we believe that, done correctly, impact investing should not require an investor to accept a sub-par risk/return profile and, at times, can serve to reduce risk and/or enhance returns.



Who?
Impact investing attracts a spectrum of investors, individual and institutional, with a diverse set of impact goals and financial return expectations; the ultimate beauty (or “impact”) of an impact opportunity will be in the eye of the beholder (the “investor”).



How?
Impact investing is a portfolio strategy that can be successfully implemented across most recognized asset classes; the market offers many attractive opportunities to invest in social and environmental solutions that also produce financial returns.






Impact Landscape





“Impact investing is very personalized. We can help navigate the options and customize an approach that aligns with your values.”
—Karen Leech | Wealth Manager


Whether you’re just starting to establish an impact investing plan or making refinements to an existing plan, we can help you evaluate the range of investment options based on the issue areas that most strongly resonate with your values. Conserving energy, fighting poverty, and improving education are some examples of this.






Portfolio Implementation


We begin with a deep review of your goals and values, followed by a recommended strategy for impact investing. We use our existing process for portfolio implementation as a starting point, while addressing specific impact investing questions and steps along the way. Once the plan is implemented, we will monitor the managers and continue to check with you on changes in your mission.






Industry Affiliations



Wetherby is proud to partner with leading networks and communities in the impact investing field to catalyze the use of investment capital in generating meaningful social and environmental impact. Read our latest industry brief and quarterly Impact Investing Digest which includes a diverse array of articles and reports about ongoing developments in the impact investing field.















Wetherby Asset Management is a Certified B Corporation®. B Corporations are leaders of the global movement of people using business as a force for good™. Certified by the non-profit organization B Lab, B Corporations meet comprehensive standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.









We are proud to partner with As You Sow, a leading practitioner of shareholder engagement and advocacy for a safe, just and sustainable future. As You Sow has been creating positive, sustainable change through shareholder advocacy since 1992.









Wetherby Asset Management is proud to sponsor ImpactAlpha as they redefine business media around social and environmental value. ImpactAlpha provides daily news and actionable intelligence for people who are building an inclusive, resilient and prosperous future.









Wetherby is excited to support NEXUS, a global movement that works to increase and improve philanthropy and impact investing by bridging communities of wealth and social entrepreneurship. With thousands of members from 70 countries, NEXUS unites young investors, social entrepreneurs, philanthropists and allies to catalyze new leadership and accelerate global solutions.









US SIF (The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment) is a network of investment management and advisory firms, research firms, non-profit associations, pension funds, foundations, and other asset owners working to advance sustainable, responsible, and impact investing across all asset classes.









We are honored to support the Thirty Percent Coalition, a national organization working to influence corporations to increase diversity and the number of women on their boards. The Coalition is committed to reaching the goal of having women, including women of color, hold 30% of board seats across public companies.

Our Culture
What Makes Us Unique
Meet the Team
 





Who We Are
You might not expect a financial services firm to use words like caring and passion in its vocabulary. To Wetherby, these aren’t just words, they’re the heart of our culture.







History


When Wetherby Asset Management was created in 1990, the concept of independent advice was considered a radical proposition.
Our founders wanted to create a new model that rewarded objectivity and results, not the products that were sold. So, we made the decision to separate fees from investment recommendations. A novel idea that became the industry standard.
We’re now one of the leading independent investment advisory firms in the United States. This is how we grew:


1.
We centered on independence and objectivity.


2.
We rewarded exceptional service to our clients.


3.
We created the opportunity for employees to own the company and build a unique culture.








Mission


Our business is investment services: portfolio management and wealth planning.
But it’s how we do it that makes the difference. Here’s what you can count on at Wetherby:




A Hands-on Team
We ask thoughtful, insightful questions, listen, and give you the best of our expertise. We’ll take the time to understand your financial objectives and life goals before developing a plan.


Trust
You’ll get our thoughtful, considered advice related to your individual needs—now and as they continue to evolve. We have guided our clients through major transitions such as marriage and having children, divorce, the loss of a loved one, a job change, and retirement.


Objectivity
We have no in-house products, and we avoid conflicts of interest. The value we offer is unbiased advice. This attracts employees who want to build close client relationships and make great investments, and it attracts clients who want an independent partner in their investment journey.


Results
That’s the bottom line. The combination of investment expertise with a culture of caring and passion produces outstanding results.

From the CEO


 Deb Wetherby, CFA®, CFP®|Founder and CEO


A New Definition of Success
I was so fortunate to spend the early part of my career as one of 14 female brokers in Morgan Stanley’s Worldwide Private Client Services group at its New York headquarters. Challenging, yes, but a fantastic education. Before that, I’d worked in the audit and consulting departments for one of the largest accounting firms in the world.
When I thought about starting my own investment advisory firm, I wanted to take the best from both these experiences: Wall Street investment acumen with the personal attention and objectivity of accounting. I wanted a third ingredient, though. I wanted to integrate something I’d been fortunate to have in my life: the feeling of being part of a large, close-knit family. I’m lucky to work every day with teammates whose passion and dedication translates into value for every one of our clients.

Jennifer A. Ayer
Wealth Manager



I moved from New York to San Francisco in 2011, and definitely feel like I’ve found a home here at Wetherby.  What I found most appealing about the firm was its independence, long history and client service orientation.  The people here have a strong work ethic and commitment to teamwork.  What I love about this business is that it allows me to guide families through major life decisions and to create strategies that align with their goals.  I have experience working with multi-generational families who have complicated trust structures and then guiding them to establish a shared mission and value proposition.
Experience summary
Jennifer combines experience in wealth management, fixed income and private equity with a passion for impact investing.  Prior to joining Wetherby she was a partner and managing director at Venture Investment Associates, a private equity fund of funds, where she worked with high-net-worth families and foundations.  Earlier, she was marketing director for Samson Capital, a fixed income investment company primarily serving families.  She started her private client advisory career at UBS, followed by seven years as a senior private client advisor at Wilmington Trust.  After moving to San Francisco, she began volunteering at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), consulting with them on bringing outside partners into their care model.  Helping families connect their goals of wealth planning and investing, with their social causes is something Jennifer is especially committed to.  She is a member of the Full Circle Fund, an active network of professionals who leverage their time, talent and connections to help nonprofit organizations influence positive change in the San Francisco Bay Area.  She is also a volunteer and supporter of Raphael House, which serves at-risk families, helping them achieve stable housing and financial independence.


CAREER HIGHLIGHTS

ABOUT ME

Exploring the Bay Area and spending time with my husband and our son is very important to me
I’m a huge theater buff, and I’ve even invested in some shows (with some pretty decent returns!)
I love listening to many kinds of music, as well as playing tennis and hiking

I JOINED WETHERBY BECAUSE
I’m in a role and an industry that I love.

I’m proud to join Wetherby at a key point in the firm’s growth. My role is to oversee the internal Research Team, which supports the investment direction of the firm. Wetherby’s diverse and collaborative investment process is a real strength, and my priority is to integrate the role of the research team with our clients’ portfolios. We center on analytic rigor, while being a successful source of investment ideas and recommendations for our clients. I see research as being totally in line with Wetherby’s reputation for trust and integrity.
EXPERIENCE SUMMARY
Bong has spent more than 20 years conducting or leading the research and analysis of investment opportunities. He started his career as a mergers and acquisitions analyst and eventually progressed to chief investment strategist for a $4 billion dollar asset management firm. After two post-college jobs performing quantitative analyses in New York and Boston, respectively, he entered Harvard’s MBA program. He moved across the country to the Bay Area, joining a small team at Capricorn Management responsible for the investment strategy of a large single family portfolio. Bong followed that with a stint at Wellington Management in Boston as a buy-side research analyst within the firm’s real estate group. He returned to the West Coast in 2008, eventually becoming a partner and chief investment strategist for Stamos Capital Partners, an investment firm managing diversified portfolios on behalf of family offices and institutions. In early 2017, Bong joined the team at Wetherby.

Sarah Copeland
Director of Estate Planning and Senior Investment Associate 



I focus on estate planning strategy for our clients, which complements our work in financial planning and portfolio management. I love the work that I do – considering estate planning issues, weighing options and developing solutions – and it is aided by the skills and methodologies I learned in law school and while practicing estate planning law. I’ve really enjoyed bringing my legal viewpoint and knowledge to my work at Wetherby, and I have gained invaluable experience in wealth planning and management. It’s a pleasure to work with colleagues who value long-term thinking and diversity.
Experience summary
Prior to starting at Wetherby in 2013, Sarah worked as an estate planning attorney at two different California law firms: Carr, McClellan, Ingersoll, Thompson & Horn PLC and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.

Sarah previously served as a board member for the Baker Institute for Children with Hearing Loss, and now stands as the Vice President of the Board of Directors of Home & Hope, a charity that aids homeless families in San Mateo County.

Christy T.  Covalesky, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder 



When I joined Wetherby, I was one of just 12 employees.  I was immediately won over by how my colleagues thought about the business as a whole and not just about “my clients” or “your clients.”  My primary focus now is advising clients on their wealth planning and investment management needs, but I also co-lead the firm’s Client Service Department and participate in our investment strategy decisions.  What made Wetherby unique when I joined is still the same today: we focus on what’s best for the client. By using this as our guide, we make decisions that earn our clients’ confidence and build their trust.
Experience summary
Christy started her career at Cambridge Associates, where she advised endowments and nonprofit institutions on investment portfolio strategy and management.  Since her start at Wetherby in 2002, Christy has been helping clients navigate financial decisions across all stages of their lives, including transitions such as retirement, marriage, and divorce.  She always connects a client’s investment strategy to the client’s personal goals.

David Ferguson, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder 



I don’t have a typical background for someone in the financial services industry, but I definitely feel I’ve been able to apply my client service background at Wetherby. I started my career in transportation at a global container shipping firm. But even before that, I drove a bus at the University of California, Davis, while I was in college. It helped me pay for college, plus one of my fellow bus drivers later became my wife! My experiences prior to joining Wetherby gave me the ability to talk comfortably with people who have varied backgrounds and interests, the chance to help build a startup into a major international operation and a deep understanding of what customer service really means. One of the most interesting experiences I’ve had here is to help one of our clients establish a charitable account funded with cows. I really love collaborating with our clients.
Experience summary
Before his start at Wetherby in 2007, David was Director of Global Operations for International Asset Systems. He built an international customer service team that served the container shipping industry from offices in the United States (Oakland, CA and Chicago, IL), as well as Hong Kong and Nice, France. He became a Wetherby shareholder in 2014.

Holly Galbrecht, CFP®
Investment Advisor



Early in my career, I worked in marketing retail and institutional investment products.  I learned a lot about different investment styles and vehicles during this part of my career.  It was a valuable experience, but I also learned that I preferred to advise individuals and help them develop their financial plans.  I decided to study for a Certificate in Financial Planning, and I worked during the day and took the courses at night.  I love being a financial planner and investment advisor.  I’m able to integrate what I learned in school with my life and work experiences.  I’m happy when I can help find solutions that respond to a client’s unique circumstances and share ideas that the client may not have thought about.

Mike Graziano, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I love being able to take a comprehensive view of my client’s financial picture – not only what is happening now but what could happen in the future. This ranges from charitable giving to retirement planning, from insurance to estate plans. I’m especially passionate about tax planning: creating tax-efficient investment portfolios and trying to achieve tax optimization over a multi-year time period. I also mentor some of our junior staff. There’s nothing more gratifying than seeing someone with drive, attention to detail and a passion to learn develop a successful career.
Experience summary
Following a four-year stint in the U.S. Air Force, Mike became a staff accountant at Given & Associates, a small CPA firm in Colorado. In that role, he prepared tax returns for individuals and compiled financial statements for small businesses. Subsequently, he moved to San Francisco and started at Wetherby in 2000. Although he was initially hired to work in the firm’s operations department, he gained new responsibilities and began serving clients in an advisory role three years later.

Christopher Hauswirth
Wealth Manager, Director of Alternative Investments and Shareholder



I was one of the earliest members of the Wetherby team. There were only about six of us when I joined, and what appealed to me was the firm’s independence. We were early pioneers of the concept, and we grew in a steady, purposeful way. We love it when prospective clients really want to dig in and learn about us – to do thorough due diligence and to ask tough questions. The best thing a client could say to us is, “I trust Wetherby completely.”
Experience summary
Chris has worn several different hats during his long tenure at Wetherby and is currently a Wealth Manager and the Director of Alternative Investments. In that latter role, Chris oversees the firm’s non-traditional investments, such as hedge funds, private equity, real assets and special situations not traded in the public markets. As a Wealth Manager, Chris sees his role as reducing the complexities of the financial world and making it more digestible and understandable for his clients. He also supports Wetherby’s asset allocation and strategic investment process. Immediately prior to joining Wetherby in 1998, Chris co-founded and ran Hauswirth & Dunn Investment Management. Previously, he was vice president and head of the financial advisor division at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco. Chris has participated in number of community organizations and is currently serving on the Board of Trustees at the Katherine Delmar Burke School, where he also chairs the Investment Committee.


Career Highlights

Worked with interesting, creative investors while at Robertson Stephens & Co.

Steve Herzog, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I have been lucky enough to travel, live, study, volunteer and work professionally in many regions of the world. I really enjoy taking what I’ve learned working with individuals and corporations in many different circumstances and cultures and applying it to help my clients solve problems. Here at Wetherby, I advise a number of large multi-generational families, and I partner closely with them to help them attain their personal, philanthropic and legacy goals.
Experience summary
Prior to joining Wetherby Asset Management in 2005, Steve ran his own hedge fund following an earlier stint as a hedge fund portfolio manager and analyst. Prior to that, Steve was a vice president at JP Morgan. There, he held a number of corporate finance and private client advisory roles in New York, London and San Francisco, advising corporate clients and wealthy families in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Steve now provides customized portfolio management and advice on diversification, tax, trust and estate planning strategies for his clients. He serves on the firm’s Investment and Asset Allocation Committees and is a member of the Financial Planning Association of San Francisco. Additionally, he serves on the Board of Directors for Environmental Traveling Companions, which provides outdoor adventures to people with disabilities and disadvantaged youth.

Jennifer K. Hicks
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I thought I was going to be a professional volleyball player. I got a full scholarship to play at a Division I school, but an injury forced me to get a “real job.” Joining Wetherby was the perfect opportunity, because what appealed to me about playing for a college team had many of the same ingredients as working here. Plus, the firm is led by a woman – Deb Wetherby – and she’s not only a role model but has cultivated the values that are important to me.
Experience summary
Jen was able to do internships with AG Edwards and a CPA firm prior to joining Wetherby in 2007, and these experiences were useful when she stepped into an operations specialist role. Soon after, she began to work directly with clients and, after three years, she became an investment associate. Jen was promoted to wealth manager and became a Wetherby shareholder in 2015. She views the best way to provide value is to think holistically, and her experiences in operations and investment planning are useful every day in her client interactions. Outside the office, Jen serves on the committee that plans the annual conference for the Financial Planning Association of Northern California, considered one of the premier financial planning events in the U.S.

Trevor Hicks, PMP®, CISSP®, CISM
Director of Technology



The best way for me to describe a typical day at the office is “grab bag.” What I like about my job is that it allows me to be creative, strategic and tactical. On the creative side, for example, I’ll research and review different technology solutions that may be appropriate to solve a problem and I’ll evaluate the costs and benefits of each. On the strategic side, I consider our firm’s goals and assess what technologies we can use or maximize to accomplish them. And on the tactical side, my day may start with an email first thing in the morning that can define the rest of my day! My clients are all the Wetherby employees, and ultimately our clients. So it’s important to think about what I can do every day to add value to each of them. My goal is to move from a role as the “tech gatekeeper” to a colleague who really empowers others to master technology.
Experience summary
Trevor began his career at a Bay Area biotech firm, diaDexus, and spent 12 years there with increasing responsibilities and varied assignments. He was promoted to lead the company’s IT group. He then joined Aechelon Technology as a senior system administrator, followed by a stint with Accenture as Global IT Lead. He started at Wetherby in 2013.

Stephen Janowsky
Chief Operating Officer and Shareholder



When I arrived at Wetherby in 2005, I was struck by its orientation toward client service as opposed to sales, and by the unique culture. It’s a firm with a heart, which comes from our leader and a focus on doing good while doing well. I think there’s an advantage in not having spent my career in financial services. I’m not tied to a specific sector, but instead I can think about our firm with a broad business perspective. I can look at operations, business development and other functions, for example, and think about what processes and policies we need to support our future plans.
Experience summary
Steve collaborates with Wetherby’s leaders to provide guidance and oversight in numerous firm areas, including client services, internal firm operations, administration, human resources, finance and business planning. He joined Wetherby as chief administrative officer and was promoted to chief operating officer three years later. Prior to joining the firm, he led North American operations at Proxicom, a boutique consultancy. Steve began his career at Ernst & Young, where he focused on identifying process and operational improvements for numerous corporations. Steve is active in a number of community organizations – he currently serves as President of the Larkspur Schools Foundation and as an honorary Director on the Board of Larkin Street Youth Services.


Career Highlights

Opened the Los Angeles office for Proxicom (literally building the office from the ground up), and later managed all the company’s North American offices

I have a broad base of experience across a range of asset classes. I’ve worked in global and international equity brokerage roles, fixed income and real estate asset management and wealth management.

Skip started his career at Goldman Sachs and was a founder of the restricted stock group in its Institutional Equity department.  He’s active in the community, serving on the Board of Directors for St. Mary’s Healthcare System for Children and the American Jewish Historical Society.  He chairs the Investment Committees of both organizations.  Skip is also an independent director of Harding Loevner Funds, Inc., a mutual fund complex.

Justina Lai
Director of Impact Investing



My goal is to harness the power of capital to create meaningful social and environmental impact while applying the discipline and rigor of conventional investing. Wetherby’s size and stature, along with our increased commitment to impact investing, offer a powerful platform through which I can better serve current and prospective clients with investments that generate positive social, environmental and financial returns.
Experience Summary
Before joining Wetherby in 2015, Justina was a Director and Senior Investment Analyst at Sonen Capital, a San Francisco Bay Area-based impact investing firm. In that role, she led the development and implementation of impact investment strategies across the private markets and supported the launch of a fund focused on global sustainable real asset opportunities.

Prior to her career in impact investing, Justina spent several years in investment banking with Citigroup and private equity with Vestar Capital Partners in New York and Paris.

Karen Leech, CPWA®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I see myself as a navigator, in a sense, guiding clients through the many different planning stages of their lives and making sure their investment strategies align with their personal goals. I provide caring, comfort and good advice through transitions like retirement, divorce and loss of a spouse. It’s important for me to stay on top of what’s going on in clients’ lives, to listen, to make sound recommendations and to be available when they need to talk. I also have a keen interest in finding ways to have a positive social impact, and I’ve worked with a number of clients to develop and implement an impact investment strategy.
Experience summary
Karen began her professional career in the United Kingdom, initially working with two big insurance companies and later as a financial advisor for Compton House Financial Management. Compton House originally had been part of a law firm before the law and financial segments were separated. The skills that were invaluable for a law firm, such as careful documentation and compliance, helped grow her capabilities as a wealth manager. After relocating to the United States, Karen soon found herself as one of Wetherby’s small but growing team of professionals. In 2004, three years after arriving at Wetherby, she became a shareholder. Karen supports a core group of clients and combines her attention to detail with listening and problem-solving skills. She contributes to the firm’s client service and communications activities; she is also active in the Financial Planning Association of San Francisco, having previously served on the Board of Directors as its Treasurer. Karen currently sits on the Investment Committee for The Redwoods, a nonprofit senior retirement community in Mill Valley.


Career Highlights

Joined the firm in 2001 and consider myself fortunate to have been mentored by Deb Wetherby
Got first-hand experience with a major business transition when Compton House separated its financial advisory services from its law practice

Education and professional certifications

Certified Financial PlannerTM certificant – UK license
Certified Private Wealth Advisor® professional
Associate by examination of the UK Society of Financial Advisors (inactive)
“Qualified Person” under the UK Law Society’s Investment Business Rules (inactive)

About me

Received the gold Duke of Edinburgh’s award when I was 19, which encouraged young people to combine community service activities with travel; went on to teach at the bronze and silver levels
I love Scrabble whenever I can find someone to play with me
Enjoy playing tennis, running and carving out time for a quiet moment to read (not an easy task since I’m married and have a son)

I joined Wetherby because
It’s a firm that places clients above all other interests.


	  		“I feel like the stars were in alignment when I was offered the job at Wetherby.  I still keep a quote from the day I joined the firm:  An opportunity of a lifetime in a lifetime of opportunity.”

John K. Mell III, CFA, CFP®
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



My role is to advise clients on customized investment strategies, portfolio construction, as well as complex retirement, trust and estate planning.  What I love about my work is that it combines logic and problem-solving skills with a focus on helping people.  Since moving to our New York office I’ve enjoyed the opportunity to share the Wetherby story with people unfamiliar with our culture and values.  We have a uniquely client-centric and service-oriented approach relative to most wealth management firms, and I love to tell others about it.
Experience summary
John began his career as a Wetherby associate in its San Francisco office in 2004 where he worked with a variety of individual and non-profit clients. He was promoted to Wealth Manager three years later, in 2007. John moved to New York City in 2010 to work with the firm’s East Coast clients and help manage Wetherby’s office there. He’s a board member of Project Explorer, a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Financial Planning Association of New York, and was formerly president of the UVA Club of San Francisco.

About me

Moved to California after graduating from college with a lot of hope – but no job
Took a two-week backpacking trip in northern Alaska
Speak some Russian – the result of taking classes and spending a semester abroad during college

I joined Wetherby because
I connected with the people here. I was young and knew there would be opportunities for me to learn as much as I could handle. I figured that a lot would be asked of me and I wasn’t intimidated by the challenge. I’m still here because there’s still so much to learn and so many more challenging investment and client situations to tackle.


	  		“There’s no ‘formula’ for Wetherby’s client service approach.  The best way I can describe our philosophy:  we serve clients the way they want to be served.”

Jack Olson, CPA, CFA, IACCP®
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Shareholder



I really enjoy working for mid-size and small organizations, in part because I’m able to wear many hats and in part because I really get to see the fruits of my labor. On the finance and compliance side, I focus on following guidelines, minimizing risk and ensuring compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. On the operations side, my role is to oversee the back office functions – essentially all the transactions, filings and documentation. I’d say I knew from an early age that I wanted to have a role in accounting and finance – my father and brother are both CPAs.
Experience summary
Jack was chief financial officer and chief compliance officer for CSI Capital Management before joining Wetherby. Earlier, he worked as an auditor for PricewaterhouseCoopers and specialized in the financial services sector. In addition to being a Certified Public Accountant in the State of California, Jack is a Chartered Financial Analyst® charter holder and an Investment Advisor Certified Compliance Professional®. He also is certified in risk management.

Andrew Pratt, CFA
Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I joined Wetherby in 2006 with nearly 30 years of investment experience in several different settings including equity research, trading, portfolio management and asset allocation. As my career moved towards portfolio management over time, my focus became more “big picture” oriented, and I found the transition enjoyable.  Wetherby manages globally diversified, multi asset class portfolios and so my experience is quite relevant both in terms of our investment decision making and in describing the market and economic environment to clients. My 10 years at Wetherby have allowed me to add experience in working with clients on a variety of issues in addition to investing.
Experience summary
Drew spent much of his career analyzing companies and managing equity portfolios. He began at the institutional trading desk for Fidelity Investments’ capital markets group, followed by a corporate role at Hewlett-Packard. These experiences confirmed his desire to be an investment analyst, and he then took a position at Montgomery Asset Management. After Montgomery was acquired by Wells Capital, he co-founded his own investment advisory firm: Fairlead Financial Advisors. In 2006, Drew started at Wetherby as a wealth manager and four years later was named Director of Research. Drew recently moved back to working solely as a Wealth Manager but still sits on the firm’s Investment Committee, Asset Allocation and Manager Committees. In addition to being a member of the Chartered Financial Analysts Society of San Francisco, Drew is active in the community, chairing the investment committee of the Tam High Foundation, serving on the Tam High Foundation Board of Directors. He previously served on the endowment fund Investment Committee of the Mill Valley Schools Community Foundation.

Simon Smundak, CFA
Senior Research Analyst and Shareholder



Back in 2006, I was working in the hedge fund industry, had taken the final part of my CFA exam and had just gotten married. Two weeks after the wedding, my wife and I took a year off to travel the world. It gave us the opportunity to spend time together, and it helped me clear my head and decide what I wanted to do next. Travel can be a bit uncomfortable and unsettling, but to me that’s what makes it so positive. I would definitely consider this experience a highlight of both my personal and professional life. I’d wanted to return to California, which is where my family settled after coming to America from Estonia. I also hoped to broaden my experience from hedge funds to a wider range of asset classes, plus I wanted to have a closer relationship with clients to help them achieve their financial goals. Wetherby gave me the opportunity to do both. My focus now is to evaluate and recommend non-traditional investments that can be integrated into our clients’ portfolio planning.
Experience summary
Simon started as an intern at Cadogan Management, a privately-owned hedge fund of funds firm, while he was still in college. Upon graduating, he became a full-time research analyst.  After his first year, he was offered an opportunity to support an in-house equity hedge fund, Arbiter Partners, led by Cadogan’s chief investment officer. After four years there, followed by one year of travel, Simon moved to San Francisco and joined Wetherby as a Research Analyst in 2008. He was promoted to Senior Research Analyst in 2011. He supports Wetherby’s investment, asset allocation and manager selection processes. Simon is a Chartered Financial Analyst® charterholder and is a member of the CFA Society of San Francisco.


CAREER HIGHLIGHTS

Started at Cadogan Management when the firm had $400 million under management; four years later, we were managing more than $2 billion
Have been able to expand my expertise from hedge fund research into a wider array of asset classes, giving me more intellectual challenges and professional growth

Education and Professional Certifications

I JOINED WETHERBY BECAUSE
Deb Wetherby valued the fact that I had spent a year traveling and soul-searching. I think that says a lot about the firm’s culture and the value that’s placed on learning and taking on new challenges.

Debra Wetherby, CFA, CFP®
Chief Executive Officer, Wealth Manager and Shareholder



I love quotes and started collecting them when I was in elementary school. One I’ve found particularly inspiring is: “If the path before you is clear, you’re probably on someone else’s.” I believe success starts with finding out what is meaningful to you, and then centering your business, goals, plans and intentions around that. When I started our firm, “traditional” investment managers used a fee structure that incentivized selling, but I wanted to build a business with values centered on exceptional service. Objectivity, integrity and thoughtfulness are what I want to reward. What I’m most proud of is not the amount of money we manage or our profits – it’s our team, our culture and how we care for our clients.
Experience summary
Deb began her career as a Certified Public Accountant, working for Price Waterhouse in San Francisco in both its Audit and Management Consulting Departments. After she received her M.B.A., she joined Morgan Stanley and worked as a private client services broker for 3 years. After leaving the company to travel she decided to enter the investment advisory/wealth management business. Her experience at a small money management firm led Deb to create Wetherby Asset Management in 1990. Through the years, Deb has been recognized for her success, being named one of the Top 50 Women in Wealth Management with the firm being listed in the Top 50 Fee-Only RIAs, and Top 50 Wealth Management RIAs. She loves to teach and has spoken on topics ranging from Impact Investing to the collective power of women helping women.

Kyle A. Winterbotham
Investment Advisor and Shareholder



My grandfather was a stockbroker and a role model. He taught me about the stock market, and I thought I’d follow in his footsteps. When my roommate told me I should consider applying at Wetherby, I wasn’t sure because I’d always seen myself as a broker. But once I met the people here and started thinking about the opportunities, I decided it would be a good fit. I understood the financial markets but I had a lot to learn about wealth management. I listened, learned, earned others’ trust and got more and more responsibility. Joining Wetherby was one of the best decisions I ever made.
EXPERIENCE SUMMARY
Kyle started as an associate in client service operations in 2006. Over time, his role evolved and is now a “hybrid,” integrating his skills in investments and research with client service support.  The importance of this new role was acknowledged in 2015, when Kyle was named a shareholder.  He coordinates between Wetherby’s operations group, wealth managers and clients, and he sees the mix of analytical work – collecting and interpreting data – and client service as a perfect blend.  He also contributes to many of Wetherby’s computer systems-based initiatives and enjoys training and mentoring new associates.


cAREER HIGHLIGHTS

Being one of Wetherby’s first employees to be promoted from operations to investment associate
Became a shareholder

Education and Professional Certifications

B.A. in Economics from the University of California, Davis

ABOUT ME

Enjoy walking around the city with my wife, our son and our dogs and taking care of the home we bought
Am an avid sports fan – the 49ers, Warriors and Giants are at the top of my list
Love to try new restaurants; cooking and hosting dinner parties have become another passion

I JOINED WETHERBY BECAUSE
It seemed like a good fit for my skills and interests, and I love the fact that we do whatever we can to make our clients happy.


	  		“Clients are our number-one priority.”

MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
