THE WAY WE EAT

                    Tex Macs                
If you walk into Chipotle on 34th Street in Manhattan at lunchtime, you will have to wait in line. Behind a counter, workers assemble burritos and tacos -- and nothing else -- in an impressively streamlined production line. Fresh tortillas are heated on a griddle, then piled with fillings like rice flecked with fresh cilantro, naturally raised Niman Ranch pork and organic beans. Burritos, good-tasting if bulky, are rolled by the hundred. The riotous crowd of lunchgoers sits at steel-topped tables on plywood chairs; rock music pours from speakers. It's not just a busy day in a busy city restaurant; it's also a chance to witness -- and taste -- a shift in American fast food. This past week, Chipotle opened its 419th store, on Varick Street in Manhattan. Nearly a hundred more will open this year. And while this may be a triumph for the increasing number of diners interested in healthful, sustainable food, there is a strange twist: Chipotle's majority investor is McDonald's.

The Panera Bread Company already has about 640 bakery cafes in 35 states, but now the fast-growing St. Louis-based retailer, which specializes in selling fresh-baked breads out of sleek cafes, has ambitious expansion plans for the New York area. Panera sells foods like Asiago cheese bread and Tuscan chicken sandwiches in outlets that often sport 40-foot-long glass storefronts and cozy booths and fireplaces.

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]

In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]

Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

		JAB Holding to acquire Panera Bread Co.

JAB BV has entered into an agreement to acquire Panera  for approximately $7.5 billion.

LUXEMBOURG — JAB BV, an investment arm of the JAB Holding Company, has entered into an agreement to acquire the Panera Bread Co., St. Louis, for approximately $7.5 billion. Upon completion, the acquisition will add to JAB’s growing global roster of bakery cafe chains that also include Caribou Coffee, Einstein Noah, Espresso House, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, and Peet’s Coffee and Tea.
Under the agreement, JAB will acquire Panera for $315 per share in cash and the assumption of $340 million in debt. The agreement represents a premium of approximately 30% to Panera’s 30-day volume-weighted average stock price as of March 31. The transaction has been approved by Panera’s board of directors.






Olivier Goudet, chief executive officer and a partner in JAB



“We have long admired Ron (Shaich) and the incredible success story he has created at Panera,” said Olivier Goudet, chief executive officer and a partner in JAB. “I have great respect for the strong business that he, together with his management team, its franchisees and its associates, has built.  We strongly support Panera’s vision for the future, strategic initiatives, culture of innovation, and balanced company versus franchise store mix. We are excited to invest in and work together with the company’s management team and franchisees to continue to lead the industry.”
Rumors that Panera Bread may be for sale began circulating on April 3. Shares of the company’s stock climbed 11.7% that day to a high of $292.42 before closing at an all-time high of $282.63. Bloomberg News identified JAB Holding, Domino’s Pizza and Starbucks Corp. as among possible suitors.






Ron Shaich, founder, chairman and c.e.o. of Panera



“By any measure, Panera has been one of the most successful restaurant companies in history,” said Mr. Shaich, who is the founder, chairman and c.e.o. of Panera. “What started as one 400-square-foot cookie store in Boston has grown to a system with over 2,000 units, approximately $5 billion in sales and over 100,000 associates. In more than 25 years as a publicly traded company, Panera has created significant shareholder value. 
“Indeed, Panera has been the best performing restaurant stock of the past 20 years – up over 8,000%. Today’s transaction is a direct reflection of those efforts, and delivers substantial additional value for our shareholders.”
The transaction is not subject to financing conditions and is expected to close during the third quarter of 2017. It is subject to the approval of Panera shareholders and customary closing conditions.

Mr. Shaich has entered into a voting agreement whereby he and groups affiliated with him have agreed to vote shares representing approximately 15.5% of the company’s voting power in favor of the transaction. Following the close of the transaction, Panera will be privately held and continue to be operated independently by the company’s management team.
“Over the last five years, we have developed and executed a powerful strategic plan to be a better competitive alternative with emerging runways for growth,” Mr. Shaich said. “The themes we have bet on - digital, wellness, loyalty, omni-channel, new formats for growth - are shaping the restaurant industry today.”

Threat of substitute productsDue to the ease of access into the fast casual restaurant industry threat of substitute products can be highOpportunities• Prime locations for fast casual dining options are available• 90 percent and growing of the population is still employed and has disposable income• A need for wireless internet dining options • Dieting trends are in growth and healthy dining options are being sought out• Fresh high quality meal opportunities are cravedThreats• Competition is on the rise due to retail space and ease of access in the industry• Economic condition decline• Close competitor heavy growth• Industry growth of 4.5% leading to encouraged competition Internal AnalysisOrganizational Governance • Founder and CEO • Panera’s Board is made up of 6 members. • The board had established three standing committeesOrganizational Culture• Panera strives to achieve “Corporate Essence.” Organizational ResourcesMarketing • Panera’s target customers ranged from ages 25 to 50, earned $40,000 to $100,000 a year, and were seeking fresh ingredients and high quality choices. • 2010 Panera began modest increases in advertising and additional investments in its marketing infrastructure.Organizational ResourcesFinance:• Panera reported a 48% increase in net income of $25,845 million in first quarter of 2010 compared to $17,432 million in the same time period of 2009.• Panera reported revenues of $364,210 million, a 14% gain of $320,709 for the same period in 2009. Organizational ResourcesOperations:• Panera supplies its bakery-cafes through there 23 fresh dough facilities. Temperature controlled trucks, driven by Panera employees, travel an average of 300 miles. • All products not supplied directly from fresh dough facilities come from independent contractors that Panera assures is high-quality and from reliable sources. Organizational ResourcesHuman Resources:Panera places high priority on staffing its facilities with skilled associates and investing in training programs to ensure the quality of its operations. In order to maintain stability among the business Panera created Joint Venture programs to select general managers and multi-unit managers that were comprised of a multi-year bonus program based on cash flow. Strengths• A strong connection with their corporate and franchise operated stores• Heavy focus on fresh baked and quality goods• Panera’s strong brand image• Panera has a strong presence in its niche segment• Leaders in the fast casual industry• In strong demand and command of consumer finances By: Ashley Carver, Bobby Lambert, Bryce Bell, Renee Johnson, Russell VandermeedenCase AnalysisWeaknesses• Panera is fairly expensive in comparison to other options average meal is +$8.50• Panera is concentrated heavily in only North America• Lack of extra disposable income due to absence of globalizationStrategic Factors AnalysisPanera is becoming one of the largest food service companies in the United States. Leading in the evolution of what has become known as the “fast causal” restaurant category; Panera seeks to remain competitively ahead of other fast food retailors through providing freshly baked artisan breads and goods while offering quality delicious foods that customers can trust.Main Issues• Their prices are higher than their competitors as they currently focus on the working class that can afford to spend an average of $8.50 for lunch.• Menu is primarily carb based (with their artisan breads) which hinders those consumers that are watching carb intake.Mission/Goals/Objectives "Panera commits to provide customers with freshly baked artisan breads and quality delicious foods that customers can trust."Outcome Goals: • Within the next 2 years, Panera will broaden its exposure in the market by appealing to a larger customer base by offering a more health conscious menu in which they maintain their quality of delicious foods that customers can trust.• Within the next 4 years, Panera will grow store profit and increase transactions due tapping into new markets in highly populated areas such as university campuses and business districts. Strategy Alternative #1Continue to create high growth by expanding presence outside of current target consumers and market development.Business Level Strategy: Focus on reaching more consumers by promoting their unique and superior value in their products, and developing more locations in booming markets.Strategy Alternative #1Generic strategy: Porter’s Generic Strategy of Differentiation FocusDescription of strategy: Provide unique and superior value to more consumers instead of just certain consumers in the economy. Develop in highly populated areas such as universities, large downtown areas, and corporate districts.Advantages & Disadvantages• Targeting more consumers in different economic classes will create more  profit growth for Panera (A)• Developing in university areas may cause more loitering among customers due to free Wi-Fi (D)• Development in college university environment may deter families (D)• Casual dining experience in corporate districts will attract more business related meetings, which means larger orders and profit (A)Strategy Alternative #2Introduce artisan menu and more healthy meal options to more consumers.Business Level Strategy: Focusing on improvement of competitive position in industry through the products and services offered.Strategy Alternative #2Generic Strategy: Porter’s Generic Strategy of DifferentiationDescription of strategy: Value is provided to customers through unique features and characteristics of products rather than by the lowest price. This is done through high quality, unique features, and high customer service.Advantages & Disadvantages• Panera took the approach of keeping labor consistent with sales and continued to invest in its employees as a way to better serve its customers through high quality customer service (A)• Introduced innovative salads utilizing new procedures to further improve quality (A)• Fresh “in house” baked breads and goods offers customers a guarantee of fresh products (A)• Appeals to only certain consumers in the market due to higher prices (D)• Prices are higher than competition, $8.50 lunches compared to $5.00 lunches (D)RecommendationsIntegrate both alternative strategies for continued success. Although Panera has continued to meet and/or exceed its earnings targets (25% EPS Growth in 2009) and its stock has continued to increase (115% from December 2007 to March 2010), targeting a broader market base is imperative for continued growth and dominance in the fast food industry.Through the introduction of their artisan menu and healthy alternative options to a broader health conscious audience, profit and competitive advantage will continue to thrive.Questions and Concerns?Full transcriptMore presentations by

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]




Panera Bread in Chicago's South Loop in 2006.


St. Louis Bread was founded by Ken Rosenthal in 1987 when he opened the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co. purchased the St. Louis Bread Company. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, a word that has roots meaning "bread basket" in Latin. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company was renovating its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.[5][6]
In May 1999, to expand Panera Bread into a national restaurant, Au Bon Pain Co. sold its other chains, including Au Bon Pain, which is now owned by Compass Group North America.[7] Panera Bread moved into its new headquarters in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 2000.[8] The company operates or franchises more than 1900 Panera Bread bakery-cafés in 46 states[5] and 20 facilities that deliver fresh dough to the bakery-cafés every day. Panera Bread's CEO is Ron Shaich.[9]
In the St. Louis area where it was founded, Panera Bread still operates under the name St. Louis Bread Company. The St. Louis metropolitan area has over 101 locations.
Growth nationally[edit]
In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on BusinessWeek's list of "Hot Growth Companies", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9% increase in profits.[10][11] In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a majority stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states (predominantly in the west and southwest). The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.[5] On January 25, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against Panera Bread alleging Panera failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects.[12] Panera settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing.[13][14] In 2008 Panera Bread expanded into Canada, beginning with Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Toronto area.[15][16] In 2009 and 2012, the restaurant review service Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.[17] Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option,[18] Best Salad,[17] and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations.[18]
Recent events[edit]
In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood offices.[19] In 2011, revenue was US$2.7 billion,[20] operating income was US$259 million,[20] net income was US$160 million,[20] assets were S$1.5 billion,[21] and equity was US$497.3 million.[21] In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience.[22]
In 2015, annual revenues were $2,681,580,000 up from $2,529,195,000 the year prior. Net income came to $149,325,000 down from $179,293,000 the year prior. Total assets equaled $1,475,318,000.[2] In January 2017, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread.[citation needed] In April 2017, Panera announced that it was being acquired by Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Company for $315 per share, or over $7 billion.[23] The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2017.[24]
Restaurants and services[edit]




A drive-through location


In 2015, there were 1,972 Panera outlets and stores, up from 1,880 the year before. 901 of those stores were company owned, while 1,071 were franchised.[2] Panera opened its 2000th location in Elyria, Ohio on March 23, 2016.[25]
In 2006 and 2007, Panera was the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the United States.[26][27] Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours.[28]
In mid-2014, Panera unveiled "Panera 2.0," a series of integrated technologies to enhance the guest experience for all consumers no matter how they choose to use Panera. Panera 2.0 brings together new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations and, ultimately, consumption to create an enhanced guest experience for "to go" and "eat in" customers. A notable feature of Panera 2.0 involves interactive tablet kiosks, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter.[22][29] The kiosks consist of iPads.[30] In addition to the kiosks, customers could also place orders and pay via an app on their own smartphone or tablet.[31]
Menu[edit]
Nutrition[edit]
In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant.[32]
In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency and a positive impact on the food system.[33] This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its 'No No List' from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016.[34] In January 2017, it announced its US food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.[citation needed]
Menu breakdown[edit]
Panera stylizes themselves as a peaceful "Bakery-Cafe" and offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as croissants, bagels, cookies, scones, muffins and brownies. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Some locations also participate in a program that donates their unsold baked goods to local charities after closing hours.[35] Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout that is broken down into the following categories:[36]


Sandwiches
Paninis
Pastas
Soups & More
Flatbreads
Salads
Side Choices
Panera Kids
Fruit Smoothies
Frozen Drinks
Iced Drinks
Coffee, Tea, and Lemonade
Espresso Drinks
Lattes/ Hot Chocolate


Panera also has a selection of seasonal offerings, such as the Strawberry Poppy Seed Chicken salad offered during the summer season and the Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread in the winter.
Panera announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu on November 5, 2015. Being one of the first fast-casual restaurants to discuss plant-based proteins caused Fortune reporter Beth Kowitt to speculate that "other restaurants will likely follow the soup-and-sandwich chain's lead."[37]
Peanut butter lawsuits[edit]
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store willingly put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being told that the person receiving it was allergic to peanuts. It was alleged that the restaurant chain acted negligently, and charged those involved with intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery,[38] which resulted in the recipient of the sandwich being hospitalized briefly.[39] Less than one month after the incident involved in this case, another restaurant reportedly had a nearly identical incident with another person who had a severe allergy to peanuts.[38]
Social responsibility[edit]
In 2009, the company's non-profit foundation created Panera Cares, a non-profit "Pay what you can" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado.[40][41] It has since expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston.[42][43][44] Each site serves approximately 3,500 people every week.[45][46][47] The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015.[48] The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016, leaving just three locations.[49]
On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020.[50] At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21 percent cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015.[51] In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler hen welfare.[citation needed]
Community outreach[edit]
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. In 2014, Panera Bread bakery-cafes donated a retail value of approximately $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by non-profit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.
Employment lawsuits[edit]
In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee who claimed he was fired after allegedly refusing to carry out discriminatory policies set forth by his superiors.[52] In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera set aside $5 million for the payment of claims and denied any wrongdoing.[53]
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having "pretty young girls" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors.[54] The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of medical leave.[54] Panera said it "does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex," and that the plaintiff "was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work."[54] The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli,[55] who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit.[56][57] Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 200 stores in Northeast Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida.[58]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
