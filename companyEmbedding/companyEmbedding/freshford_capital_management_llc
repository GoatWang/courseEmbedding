Freshford Capital Management LLC


                  Freshford Capital's equity strategy focuses on a broad range of equity investment styles, including growth, core, and value. The firm employs a fundamental value investment strategy in which they seek to invest in asset-oriented securities they believe are undervalued by the market. Freshford Capital also engages in a capital growth investment strategy in which they seek to invest in securities of a company whose earnings they expect to grow at an above-average rate as compared to the company's specific industry or the overall market. The firm utilizes a variety of financial instruments such as derivatives, options, interest rate swaps, futures and forward contracts for risk management purposes.To maintain flexibility and profit, they engage in short selling strategies as a form of hedging to offset potential declines in long positions in similar securities. In addition, Freshford Capital pursues relative value strategies by taking long positions in securities believed to be undervalued and short positions in securities believed to be overvalued. Their investment program may employ the use of leverage.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Our Firm - Frontier Capital Management Company

























 
	  
	  
Our Firm 
Frontier
Capital Management Company, LLC is a Boston-based investment management
firm. Founded in 1980, the firm manages $14.3 billion in client assets as of June 30, 2017
in small, small/mid, mid and all cap U.S. equity strategies. These
strategies are managed under a style that is widely defined as “growth
at reasonable valuations.” In 1999, the product line was broadened to
include small cap value. In 2000, Frontier became an affiliate of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.
(AMG). Under this ownership arrangement, AMG has a majority interest in
Frontier, with the remaining ownership interest held broadly among
Frontier employees. Frontier employees control all of the firm's
management and the investment process.
Our primary
focus and key success factor has been our dedication to internally
generated detailed fundamental research. Through in depth analysis, we
identify companies on a “bottom up” basis that we believe have the
potential to show above average returns for our clients' portfolios.
Our integrated team of 18 investment professionals provides a wide
range of industry coverage and individual company analysis.

Nearly all of the assets at Frontier are managed for institutional
clients. We do not manage any hedge funds or proprietary mutual funds,
allowing for a focused business environment.
 Since
inception, Frontier has grown at a steady, manageable pace. We have a
deep appreciation for the importance of controlled growth at all
levels, placing a priority on long term investment performance. This
allows us to emphasize superior investment performance, while
delivering excellent client service and providing opportunities for our
employees.
