Mall REITs lead broad-based selloff of real estate-related stocks 
Real estate-related stocks were the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Monday, led by mall REITS, on continued concerns about weak traffic and the onslaught on bricks-and-mortar stores from juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. . The sector has struggled this year as a record number of retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, while others have announced store closures. Retailers like Macy's Inc. , which reports first-quarter earnings this week, and Sears Holdings Corp.  are viewed as anchor stores that help draw traffic to malls, to the benefit of specialty retailers, who rely on that traffic boost. Among individual stocks, Kimco Realty Corp. , an operator of outdoor malls, was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Macerich Company  slid 2.5%, Simon Property Group Inc.  was down 2.3% and GGP Inc.  fell 2.1%. Federal Realty Investment Trust  and Regency Centers Corp.  fell 1.9%.  The SPDR S&P Retail ETF  was down 0.3%. The S&P 500  was down 0.2%.

History[edit]
Kimco Realty Corporation was founded in 1966 by a group of real estate investors who decided to group their shopping center assets to create a resourceful corporation. Martin Kimmel and Milton Cooper were part of the corporation's founders. Originally, Kimco Realty Corporation was focused on building its own shopping centers. During the 1980s, Cooper changed the corporation's strategy to focus on acquisitions.[1] In 1991, Kimco became a public company in the first REIT public offering, valued at $120 million.[2]

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. These unaudited financial statements include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented, and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Executive Summary  Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nation's largest publicly-traded owners and operators of open-air shopping centers. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had interests in 511 shopping center properties aggregating 84.1 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA") located in 32 states, Puerto Rico and Canada. In addition, the Company had 376 other property interests, primarily through the Company's preferred equity investments and other real estate investments, totaling 5.7 million square feet of GLA.  The executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company.  The Company's strategy is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air shopping centers through investments primarily in the U.S. To achieve this strategy the Company is (i) continuing to transform the quality of its portfolio by disposing of lesser quality assets and acquiring larger, higher quality properties in key markets identified by the Company, for which substantial progress has been achieved as of June 30, 2017, (ii) simplifying its business by: (a) reducing the number of joint venture investments and (b) exiting Mexico, South America and Canada, for which the exit of South America has been completed, Mexico has been substantially completed and the Company has essentially sold all of its operating properties in Canada, (iii) pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase overall value and  Table of Contents  Results of Operations Comparison of the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 Three Months Ended June 30, (amounts in millions) 2017 2016 Change % change Revenues from rental property (1) $ 292.8 $ 287.1 $ 5.7 2.0 % Rental property expenses: (3) Rent $ 2.8 $ 2.7 $ 0.1 3.7 % Real estate taxes 38.7 35.8 2.9 8.1 % Operating and maintenance 35.4 33.2 2.2 6.6 % $ 76.9 $ 71.7 $ 5.2 7.3 % Depreciation and amortization (4) $ 95.3 $ 82.8 $ 12.5 15.1 %  Comparison of the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016   Six Months Ended June 30, (amounts in millions) 2017 2016 Change % change Revenues from rental property (2) $ 582.2 $ 580.2 $ 2.0 0.3 % Rental property expenses: (3) Rent $ 5.5 $ 5.5 $ - - Real estate taxes 77.0 70.3 6.7 9.5 % Operating and maintenance 69.7 67.8 1.9 2.8 % $ 152.2 $ 143.6 $ 8.6 6.0 % Depreciation and amortization (4) $ 187.3 $ 167.6 $ 19.7 11.8 %  (1) Revenues from rental property increased for the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition and consolidation of operating properties during 2017 and 2016, providing incremental revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 of $13.8 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in revenues of $7.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to tenant vacates during 2017 and 2016, which includes below market rent write-offs, and (iii) a decrease in revenues of $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due to properties sold during 2017 and 2016.  (2) Revenues from rental property increased for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition and consolidation of operating properties during 2017 and 2016, providing incremental revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 of $27.3 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in revenues of $17.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due to properties sold during 2017 and 2016 and (iii) a decrease in revenues of $8.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to tenant vacates during 2017 and 2016 which includes below market rent write-offs.  (3) Rental property expenses include (i) rent expense relating to ground lease payments for which the Company is the lessee, (ii) real estate tax expense for consolidated properties for which the Company has a controlling ownership interest and (iii) operating and maintenance expense, which consists of property related costs including repairs and maintenance costs, roof repair, landscaping, parking lot repair, snow removal, utilities, property insurance costs, security and various other property related expenses. Rental property expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016, primarily due to the increase in real estate tax expense and acquisition/consolidation of operating properties in 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the disposition of properties during 2017 and 2016.  (4) Depreciation and amortization increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016, primarily due to the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties in 2017 and 2016, and write-offs relating to the Company's redevelopment projects in 2016, partially offset by property dispositions in 2017 and 2016.  General and administrative costs include employee-related expenses (salaries, bonuses, equity awards, benefits, severance costs and payroll taxes), professional fees, office rent, travel expense and other company-specific expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $2.7 million and $4.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016, primarily due to reductions in public company costs, professional fees and other personnel related costs.  During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $31.3 million and $58.1 million, respectively, for which the Company's estimated fair values of these properties were primarily based upon estimated sales prices from  Other income/(expense), net changed $3.9 million to income of $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to an expense of $1.2 million for the corresponding period in 2016. This change is primarily due to (i) a reduction in acquisition and demolition related costs of $1.1 million, (ii) an increase in foreign currency translation gains of $0.9 million and (iii) an increase in gains on land sales of $0.6 million.  Interest expense decreased $4.4 million and $10.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. This decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates on borrowings during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016.  Benefit/(provision) for income taxes, net changed $13.4 million to a benefit of $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to a provision of $11.9 million for the corresponding period in 2016. This change is primarily due to (i) a decrease in foreign tax expense of $29.9 million primarily relating to the sale of certain unconsolidated properties during 2016 within the Company's Canadian portfolio which were subject to foreign taxes at a consolidated reporting entity level and (ii) a decrease in tax provision of $4.3 million resulting from the Company's merger of its taxable REIT subsidiary into a wholly-owned LLC of the Company on August 1, 2016, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in tax benefit of $21.2 million related to impairment charges recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Equity in income of joint ventures, net decreased $95.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a decrease in gains of $92.9 million resulting from fewer sales of properties and interests within various joint venture investments, including the Company's Canadian Portfolio, during the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, and (ii) lower equity in income of $4.5 million primarily resulting from the sales of properties within various joint venture investments and the acquisition of partnership interests in joint ventures by the Company during 2017 and 2016, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in impairment charges of $1.9 million recognized during 2017, as compared to 2016.  Equity in income of joint ventures, net decreased $150.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a decrease in gains of $146.4 million resulting from fewer sales of properties and interests within various joint venture investments, including the Company's Canadian Portfolio, during the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, and  During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company acquired, in separate transactions, a controlling interest in three operating properties from certain joint venture partners in which the Company had noncontrolling interests. The Company recorded a gain on change in control of interests of $71.2 million related to the fair value adjustment associated with its previously held equity interest in the operating properties.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company acquired, in separate transactions, a controlling interest in one operating property and one development project from certain joint venture partners in which the Company had noncontrolling interests. The Company recorded a gain on change in control of interests of $46.5 million related to the fair value adjustment associated with its previously held equity interest in the operating property.  Equity in income of other real estate investments, net increased $30.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $34.6 million in equity in income from the Albertsons joint venture resulting from a cash distribution received in excess of the Company's carrying basis during the three months ended June 30, 2017, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from and profit participation from capital transactions within the Company's Preferred Equity Program of $4.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.  Equity in income of other real estate investments, net increased $23.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $34.6 million in equity in income from the Albertsons joint venture resulting from cash distributions received in excess of the Company's carrying basis during the six months ended June 30, 2017, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from and profit participation from capital transactions within the Company's Preferred Equity Program of $11.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.  Table of Contents  During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company disposed of 11 consolidated operating properties and five out-parcels, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $157.3 million. These transactions resulted in an aggregate gain of $21.6 million and aggregate impairment charges of $2.4 million.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company disposed of 20 consolidated operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $282.3 million. These transactions resulted in an aggregate gain of $66.2 million, after income tax expense, and aggregate impairment charges of $7.2 million.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $9.8 million and $9.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. This increase is primarily due to equity in income attributable to the Company's noncontrolling partners in the Albertsons joint venture during 2017.  Net income attributable to the Company was $143.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $203.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. On a diluted per share basis, net income available to the Company's common shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was $0.31 as compared to $0.46 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Net income attributable to the Company was $220.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $344.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. On a diluted per share basis, net income available to the Company's common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was $0.46 as compared to $0.77 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. These changes are primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in equity in income of joint ventures, net, resulting from the sales of properties within various joint venture investments and the acquisition of partnership interests in joint ventures by the Company during 2017 and 2016, and (ii) a decrease in gains on sale of operating properties, partially offset by (iii) an increase in equity in income of other real estate investments, net, (iv) a decrease in impairment charges of operating properties, (v) an increase from gain on change of control of interests and (vi) a decrease in interest expense.  Tenant Concentration  The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At June 30, 2017, the Company's five largest tenants were TJX Companies, The Home Depot, Ahold Delhaize, Bed Bath & Beyond and Albertsons, which represented 3.6%, 2.5%, 2.1%, 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively, of the Company's annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's capital resources include accessing the public debt and equity capital markets, mortgage and construction loan financing, borrowings under term loans and immediate access to an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with bank commitments of $2.25 billion which can be increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature.  The Company's cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions):   Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 300.0 $ 215.8 Net cash flow (used for)/provided by investing activities $ (147.4 ) $ 311.3 Net cash flow used for financing activities $ (152.0 ) $ (378.9 )  Operating Activities  The Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its Credit Facility, and the issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017, were $300.0 million, as compared to $215.8 million for the comparable period in 2016. This increase of $84.2 million is primarily attributable to (i) an increase of cash flow due to new leasing, expansion, re-tenanting of core portfolio properties and a decrease in interest expense and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities due to timing of receipts and payments and  Table of Contents  Investing Activities  Cash flows used for investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017, were $147.4 million, as compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of $311.3 million for the comparable period in 2016. This change of $458.7 million resulted primarily from (i) a decrease in return of investment from liquidation of real estate joint ventures of $149.3 million, primarily due to the liquidation of certain Canadian joint ventures in 2016, (ii) a decrease in proceeds from the sale of operating properties of $148.1 million, (iii) a decrease in distributions from liquidation of real estate joint ventures of $136.0 million, (iv) an increase in improvements to real estate under development of $73.3 million (v) a decrease of $40.6 million in reimbursements of investments in and advances to real estate joint ventures and (vi) an increase in improvements to operating real estate of $10.9 million, partially offset by (vii) a decrease in acquisition of real estate under development of $40.8 million, (viii) a decrease in acquisition of operating real estate and other related net assets of $39.8 million and (ix) an increase in reimbursements of investments and advances to other real estate investments of $29.3 million.  Acquisitions of Operating Real Estate and Other Related Net Assets-  During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company expended $56.0 million and $95.8 million, respectively, towards the acquisition of operating real estate properties. The Company continues to transform its operating portfolio through its capital recycling program by acquiring what the Company believes are high quality U.S. retail properties and disposing of lesser quality assets. The Company anticipates acquiring approximately $275.0 million to $325.0 million of operating properties during the remainder of 2017. The Company intends to fund these acquisitions with proceeds from property dispositions, cash flow from operating activities, assumption of mortgage debt, if applicable, and availability under the Company's revolving line of credit.  Improvements to Operating Real Estate- During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company expended $81.3 million and $70.3 million, respectively, towards improvements to operating real estate. These amounts consist of the following (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Redevelopment and renovations $ 66,934 $ 38,217 Tenant improvements and tenant allowances 10,047 26,470 Other 4,299 5,646 Total (1) $ 81,280 $ 70,333  (1) During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company capitalized interest of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and capitalized payroll of $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in connection with the Company's improvements to operating real estate.  During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company capitalized personnel costs of $6.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, relating to deferred leasing costs.  The Company has an ongoing program to redevelop and re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. The Company is actively pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its operating portfolio which it believes will increase the overall value by bringing in new tenants and improving the assets' value. The Company has identified three categories of redevelopment, (i) large scale redevelopment, which involves demolishing and building new square footage, (ii) value creation redevelopment, which includes the subdivision of large anchor spaces into multiple tenant layouts, and (iii) creation of out-parcels and pads which are located in the front of the shopping center properties. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these redevelopment projects and re-tenanting efforts during the remainder of 2017 will be approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Company's revolving line of credit.  Real Estate Under Development-  The Company is engaged in select real estate development projects, which are expected to be held as long-term investments. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had in progress a total of five active real estate development projects and two additional projects held for future development located in the U.S. The Company anticipates costs to complete these projects to be approximately $600.0 million to $700.0 million. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these . . .  Jul 28, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Kimco Realty (KIM) Meets Q2 FFO Estimates, Reaffirms Outlook


July 27, 2017, 10:34:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 Retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Kimco Realty Corporation  's KIM  second-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) came in at 38 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported the same FFO a year ago.    Total revenue for the quarter was $297 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292 million.Adjusted revenues came in at $292.8 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter.    At the end of the quarter, pro rata occupancy came in at 95.5%, reflecting a sequential increase of 20 basis points (bps).    Same-property net operating income (NOI) inched up 0.3% year over year. Pro rata rental-rate leasing spreads grew 10.5%, with rental rates for new leases and renewals/options, increasing 17% and 7.8%, respectively.   Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise      Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Kimco Realty Corporation Quote   Note: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share  .   Balance Sheet Position    Kimco exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $143.1 million, up from $142.5 million at year-end 2016.    The company also received $23.7 million as cash distribution from its investment in Albertsons LLC.   Portfolio Activity    During the quarter, the company announced acquisitions of a parcel for $700 million. Kimco share of the purchase price was $340 million. The parcel located in Augusta, GA, is adjacent to the company's Augusta Exchange shopping center.    On the other hand, its second-quarter sales aggregated $155.8 million, with Kimco's share of sale price $128.1 million. This involved the disposition of nine shopping centers, aggregating 892,000 square feet of space and two land parcels. Following these disposals, the company wound up its business in the states of Maine and Louisiana.    (Read more: Kimco Buys Jantzen Beach Center, Reveals Q2 Activities  .)  Guidance    Kimco reaffirmed its outlook for 2017. The company projects FFO as adjusted per share in the $1.50-$1.54 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 is currently pegged at $1.52.    Notably, the company estimates the U.S. portfolio occupancy to be in the range of 95.8-96.2%, same-property NOI (including redevelopments) to grow 2-3%, operating property acquisitions of $300-$400 million and dispositions of $300-$400 million.   Dividend Update    Kimco's board of directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 27 cents. The dividend will be paid on Oct 16 to shareholders of record as of Oct 4, 2017.   Our Viewpoint     The company remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the U.S. This is reflected in its portfolio restructuring activities in the quarter. With premium properties in high-income and high-growth areas, Kimco is well poised for growth.    However, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Further, retailers not being able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like Kimco, as this trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably.    Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).    You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here     The stock has lost 21.5% year to date, underperforming the 3.8% decline of the industry  it belongs to.       We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust RPT  , Boston Properties, Inc. BXP  and Macerich Company (The) MAC  . While Ramco-Gershenson Properties and Boston Properties are scheduled to announce results on Aug 1, Macerich Company is slated to report Q2 numbers on Aug 2.   Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.

by Ciara Linnane









Mall REITs lead broad-based selloff of real estate-related stocks 
Real estate-related stocks were the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Monday, led by mall REITS, on continued concerns about weak traffic and the onslaught on bricks-and-mortar stores from juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. . The sector has struggled this year as a record number of retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, while others have announced store closures. Retailers like Macy's Inc. , which reports first-quarter earnings this week, and Sears Holdings Corp.  are viewed as anchor stores that help draw traffic to malls, to the benefit of specialty retailers, who rely on that traffic boost. Among individual stocks, Kimco Realty Corp. , an operator of outdoor malls, was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Macerich Company  slid 2.5%, Simon Property Group Inc.  was down 2.3% and GGP Inc.  fell 2.1%. Federal Realty Investment Trust  and Regency Centers Corp.  fell 1.9%.  The SPDR S&P Retail ETF  was down 0.3%. The S&P 500  was down 0.2%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
