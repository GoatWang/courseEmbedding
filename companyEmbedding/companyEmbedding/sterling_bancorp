Kitchen Sinks FAQs



Q: 
What is Vikrell®?


Solid Vikrell material by Sterling offers exceptional strength combined with resistance to chipping, cracking and peeling. Vikrell is a solid composite material made of resins, fiberglass and filler that is exclusive to Kohler Company. The material is compression molded in large presses to form baths and wall surrounds that are structurally rigid yet lightweight and feature a non-porous surface that is easy to clean. Click here to learn more about Vikrell material. 



Q: 
Is higher or lower gauge steel better?


The lower the gauge, the thicker the steel. Thick steel is less likely to dent and is more sound resistant.



Q: 
What is SilentShield® technology?


SilentShield sound-deadening pads are applied to all STERLING sinks creating a quieter sink (from clanging disposal or silverware) versus many competitors. The sound-deadening technology was borrowed from the auto industry.

Bathtubs FAQs



Q: 
What is the difference between a right-hand and left-hand bath?


When looking at a whirlpool or bath, you must establish the reference point, which is the entry side or threshold. From the entry side of the whirlpool or bath, the drain location determines whether the unit is right-hand or left-hand.  An right-hand bath has its drain on the right side and a left-hand bath has its drain on the left side.



Q: 
What is the removable apron option?


The apron or skirt, covers the front of a bath or whirlpool.  A removable apron allows limited access to the pump/motor and to plumbing system components on the apron side of the unit.



Q: 
The bathtub in my home measures 58" but I cannot find a STERLING bathtub for that size?


The standard size for bathtubs is 60" and are installed in the rough stage of construction (against the studs). After rough installation a 1/2" of wall board and a 1/2" of tile is typically added on top of the studs at each end of the bath making a finished installation roughly 58".

The management of Skye Bank on Friday confirmed holding about $41 million (about N12. 9billion) belonging to the Nigerian Investments Management Services, NAPIMS, allegedly kept away from the Treasury Single Account, TSA account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN.
The money is part of about $793.2 million (about N249.9 billion) allegedly kept illegally in the custody of seven commercial banks.
This was in violation of the directive by the Accountant General of the Federation that effective September 15, 2015, all such funds be transferred to the TSA account domiciled with the CBN.
The affected banks include Skye Bank, United Bank for Africa, UBA; Diamond Bank Plc; First Bank Limited; Fidelity Bank Plc; Keystone Bank Limited and Sterling Bank Plc.
The funds allegedly kept by the banks include revenues, donations, transfers, refunds, grants, taxes, fees, dues, tariffs, etc by different government ministries, departments, parastatals, and agencies.
A Federal High Court in Lagos on Thursday ordered the banks to remit the various amounts sum into the TSA account at the CBN.
Justice Chuka Obiozor had in the case brought by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation ordered the seven banks to immediately remit the various amounts allegedly kept illegally in their custody to the designated Federal Government’s Asset Recovery dollars account with the CBN.
Details showed about $367.4million was concealed by three government agencies in UBA, while about $41million belonging to NAPIMS, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, subsidiary was placed on fixed deposit account with the Skye Bank.
Others included $277.9million in Diamond Bank, $18.9million in First Bank; $24.5million in Fidelity Bank; $17million in Keystone Bank; and $46.5million in Sterling Bank.
But, Skye Bank, in a statement on Friday, confirmed the $41 million in its custody, but denied keeping same illegally or concealing the transaction.
“The management of Skye Bank hereby states that it neither colluded nor unilaterally hid the reported sum or any other funds in its custody.” it’s spokesperson, Nduneche Ezurike, said in the statement.
“On the contrary, the said funds are held with the full knowledge of the relevant agencies of government, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the DSS, the National Assembly and the Inspector General of Police’s Special Investigation Panel, with whom we have engaged extensively over same,” he explained.
As a law abiding institution, Mr. Ezurike said Skye Bank would not conduct itself in breach of the laws or policies of the government, including the TSA policy.
He said the bank would take appropriate legal steps to respond to the ruling of the Court come August 8 when the substantive hearing is scheduled.

TSA Breach: Seven Banks 'Hid N249.6b For Unknown Government Officials'


The AGF through a counsel, Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN), accused the commercial banks of illegally keeping the sums in their custody for “unknown government officials.”





by The Nation Newspaper
Jul 20, 2017



























A Federal High Court in Lagos Thursday ordered seven banks to remit a total of $793,200,000 (about N249,659,700,000.00), allegedly hidden with them in breach of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) policy, to the Federal Government.
A vacation judge, Justice Chuka Obiozor, made the interim order following an ex parte application by the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF).
The judge warned that the remittance order would be made permanent on August 8, unless cause was shown why it should not.
The AGF through a counsel, Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN), accused the commercial banks of illegally keeping the sums in their custody for “unknown government officials.”
Justice Obiozor ordered the banks to remit the various amounts to the designated Federal Government’s Asset Recovery dollars account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
The banks are United Bank for Africa (UBA), Diamond Bank Plc, Skye Bank Plc, First Bank Limited, Fidelity Bank Plc, Keystone Bank Limited and Sterling Bank Plc.
According to court processes filed by Akinseye-George (SAN), a total of $367.4m was illegally hidden by three government agencies in UBA.
Another $41m was allegedly illegally kept in a National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) fixed deposit account with Skye Bank.
The documents stated that $277.9m was hidden in Diamond Bank, $18.9m in First Bank, $24.5m in Fidelity Bank, $17m in Keystone Bank, and $46.5m in Sterling Bank.
The AGF’s application was supported by a 15-paragraph affidavit deposed to by a lawyer from Akinseye-George’s law firm, Vincent Adodo.
Adodo averred that the banks colluded with Federal Government officials to hide the funds in breach of the TSA policy.
The funds, he stated, were revenues, donations, transfers, refunds, grants, taxes, fees, dues, tariffs etc accruable to the Federal Government from different ministries, departments, parastatals and agencies.
Adodo said the banks failed to remit the funds to the TSA domiciled in the CBN in violation of the guidelines issued by the Accountant-General of the Federation which fixed September 15, 2015 as the deadline for such funds to be moved.
“The 1st to 7th respondents (banks), in collaboration with and/or collusion with unknown officials of the Federal Government, conspired to disobey the relevant constitutional provisions, thereby depriving the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of funds belonging to it, which are needed urgently to fund pressing national projects under the 2017 budget,” Adodo said.
Among the allegedly culpable government agencies is National Petroleum Developing Company (NPDC).
Moving the ex parte application yesterday, Akinseye-George said it would best serve the interest of justice for Justice Obiozor to order the banks to remit the funds to the Federal Government, to prevent the funds from being moved or dissipated.
“The withheld funds are urgently required for the implementation of the 2017 budget. The budget has a lifespan of 12 months and we are already in the middle of the year.
“By hiding these hidden funds, the Federal Government is being forced to borrow money from these commercial banks at exorbitant interest rates,” Akinseye-George added.
After listening to the SAN, Justice Obiozor granted the interim orders.
He directed that the order should be published in a national daily newspaper.
The judge adjourned till August 8, “for anyone interested in the funds to appear” before him “to show cause why the interim orders should not be made permanent.”

FirstBank, Keystone Deny Concealing TSA Funds

July 23, 2017 0 1060 















Obinna Chima
FirstBank Nigeria Limited has denied reports that it failed to comply with the federal government’s Treasury Single Accounts (TSA) policy. The bank said this in a statement saturday.





Ten months after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) suspended nine commercial banks from trading in the interbank foreign exchange (IFEX) market for failing to remit a total of $2.33 billion belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation/Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company to the federal government’s TSA, a Federal High Court in Lagos had Thursday ordered seven of the banks to temporarily remit a total of $793.2 million allegedly still domiciled with them in contravention of the TSA policy.
Justice Chuka Obiozor had ordered the seven banks – Diamond Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), FirstBank, Skye Bank, Fidelity Bank, Sterling Bank and the defunct Keystone Bank (acquired by Heritage Bank) – to remit the various amounts allegedly kept “illegally in their custody” to the designated federal government asset recovery dollar account domiciled with the CBN.
According to the court papers filed by counsel for the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN), a total of $367.4 million was illegally hidden by three government agencies in UBA, while the sum of $41 million was illegally kept in a National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMs) fixed deposit account with Skye Bank.
But FirstBank in the statement explained “that it does not hold any funds due NPDC and NNPC that are TSA eligible as carried in recent media reports as the bank has since transferred all funds due to the TSA accounts in compliance with the policy directive.”
It added: “FirstBank remains a compliant institution and always abides by all extant regulatory rules and regulations.”
Meanwhile, the management of Keystone Bank Limited has insisted that the lender did not and has never hidden any fund belonging to the Federal Government or its agencies.
Justice Chuka Obiozor of a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos had recently ordered seven banks to remit the various sums allegedly being kept illegally in their custody to the designated Federal Government’s Asset Recovery dollars-account domiciled with the CBN.
The banks in question were United Bank for Africa, UBA; Diamond Bank Plc; Skye Bank Plc; First Bank Limited; Fidelity Bank Plc; Keystone Bank Limited; and Sterling Bank Plc.
However, some of these banks have disputed this allegation. In a statement, Keystone Bank also said: “In response to the news making the rounds that the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos had made an order directing Keystone Bank Limited to remit the sum of $17 million allegedly illegally kept in its custody to the TSA, we wish to state that Keystone Bank has never illegally hidden any amount of money belonging to the Federal Government or any of its agencies.
“Details of all Federal Government funds in custody of Keystone Bank had always been fully disclosed to all relevant federal government agencies and at no time did Keystone Bank collude or ‎conspire with any official of the Federal Government to disobey the Federal Government directives on the TSA. We are taking appropriate steps to respond to the issues raised in the Court Order,” the bank stated.

A Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday ordered seven banks to remit to the Federal Government $793,200,000 (about N249,659,700,000.00) allegedly hidden with them in breach of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) policy.




According to The Nation, the interim order was given by a vacation judge, Justice Chuka Obiozor following an ex parte application by the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF).




The judge warned that the remittance order would be made permanent on August 8, unless cause was shown why it should not. The AGF, through his counsel, Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN), accused the commercial banks of illegally keeping the sums in their custody for “unknown government officials”.




Justice Obiozor ordered the banks to remit the money to the designated Federal Government’s Asset Recovery dollars account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
The banks are United Bank for Africa (UBA), Diamond Bank Plc, Skye Bank Plc, First Bank Limited, Fidelity Bank Plc, Keystone Bank Limited and Sterling Bank Plc.
According to court processes filed by Akinseye-George (SAN), $367.4m was hidden by three government agencies in UBA; $41m was kept in a National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) fixed deposit account with Skye Bank.
The documents stated that $277.9m was in Diamond Bank, $18.9m in First Bank, $24.5m in Fidelity Bank, $17m in Keystone Bank, and $46.5m in Sterling Bank.
The AGF’s application was supported by a 15-paragraph affidavit deposed to by a lawyer from Akinseye-George’s law firm, Vincent Adodo. Adodo averred that the banks colluded with Federal Government officials to hide the funds in breach of the TSA policy.

Court orders remittance of $792.3m allegedly hidden in 7 banks
Barsaba Taglieri
Luglio 22, 2017



Condividere













Justice Chuka Obiozor of the Lagos Division of the Federal High Court has ordered the remittance of $793,200,000 by some Nigerian commercial banks to the federal government. The management of Skye Bank hereby states that it neither colluded nor unilaterally hid the reported sum or any other funds in its custody.It will be recalled that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in the past sanctioned banks for hiding funds belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) from the TSA.The 7 banks affected by the court order are United Bank for Africa (UBA), Diamond Bank Plc, Skye Bank Plc, First Bank Limited, Fidelity Bank Plc, Keystone Bank Limited and Sterling Bank Plc.Justice Obiozor ordered the banks to remit the money to the designated Federal Government's Asset Recovery dollars account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).The interim order was given after the court listened to an ex-parte application filed by Yemi Akinseye-George, professor and counsel to the attorney general of the federation.The documents stated that $277.9m was in Diamond Bank, $18.9m in First Bank, $24.5m in Fidelity Bank, $17m in Keystone Bank, and $46.5m in Sterling Bank.In early August 2015, the Federal Government had directed all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), including to make payments into a Treasury Single Account (TSA).The government had expressed optimism that the directive would promote transparency and facilitate compliance with Sections 80 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution.

Sterling Bancorp is a regional bank holding company whose principal subsidiary, Sterling National Bank, provides a full range of banking and financial services to business owners, their families, and consumers, primarily in the greater New York metropolitan and Hudson Valley regions.

History[edit]
The entity now known as Sterling was founded in 1888 under the name Provident Bank. It later became a subsidiary of Provident New York Bancorp.[5]
On August 10, 2012, the company acquired Gotham Bank of New York, which enabled the company to expand into the New York City marketplace.[6]
On October 31, 2013, the company acquired Sterling Bancorp through a merger. Provident changed its legal name to Sterling Bancorp and the name of its principal banking subsidiary to Sterling National Bank. The merger was intended to create a larger, more diversified company with a broader range of products and services for small-to-middle market commercial clients and consumers.[2]
On June 30, 2015, Sterling completed the acquisition of Hudson Valley Holding Corp., which further expanded its presence in the greater New York Metropolitan region.[2]
The company also made smaller acquisitions to add specialized products and services, most recently including Damian Services Corp., a payroll financing business (acquired March 2, 2015),[7] and a factoring portfolio from First Capital Corp. (acquired May 18, 2015).[8]
Through these acquisitions Sterling has expanded its range of services and market presence while providing opportunities for cost efficiencies and higher revenues and earnings.[2]
Differentiation[edit]
The company is pursuing a strategy of becoming a high-performing banking institution with a focus on serving small to middle market commercial businesses and affluent consumers. The bank believes this client segment is frequently underserved by larger bank competitors in its market area. Sterling employs a team-based strategy in which each client is served by relationship team that provides a single point of contact for delivering the bank’s products and services and manages all aspects of the client relationship.[2]

History[edit]
The entity now known as Sterling was founded in 1888 under the name Provident Bank. It later became a subsidiary of Provident New York Bancorp.[5]
On August 10, 2012, the company acquired Gotham Bank of New York, which enabled the company to expand into the New York City marketplace.[6]
On October 31, 2013, the company acquired Sterling Bancorp through a merger. Provident changed its legal name to Sterling Bancorp and the name of its principal banking subsidiary to Sterling National Bank. The merger was intended to create a larger, more diversified company with a broader range of products and services for small-to-middle market commercial clients and consumers.[2]
On June 30, 2015, Sterling completed the acquisition of Hudson Valley Holding Corp., which further expanded its presence in the greater New York Metropolitan region.[2]
The company also made smaller acquisitions to add specialized products and services, most recently including Damian Services Corp., a payroll financing business (acquired March 2, 2015),[7] and a factoring portfolio from First Capital Corp. (acquired May 18, 2015).[8]
Through these acquisitions Sterling has expanded its range of services and market presence while providing opportunities for cost efficiencies and higher revenues and earnings.[2]
Differentiation[edit]
The company is pursuing a strategy of becoming a high-performing banking institution with a focus on serving small to middle market commercial businesses and affluent consumers. The bank believes this client segment is frequently underserved by larger bank competitors in its market area. Sterling employs a team-based strategy in which each client is served by relationship team that provides a single point of contact for delivering the bank’s products and services and manages all aspects of the client relationship.[2]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Benefits are routine.ConsThis is a place for a job, not a career. Little chance for advancement unless you are part of the "inner circle," closest to the President and executive management. Sad, you could work your butt off for years, and never acheive the level you may desire. As the bank is actively gobbling up other smaller banks and laying off their staff, there is always the real risk that management will decide one day to sell the bank at a profit. The "inner circle" will move on.Advice to ManagementKeep the "lower level" employees in the loop. Most people really want to know what's going on in the organization from day to day, that affects them directly, beyond their routine JOB assignment.Employees want to know as far ahead of time if they are going to become unemployed.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Sterling Bancorp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sterling Bancorp 2016-08-18 12:27 PDT Jul 24, 2016 Helpful (1)"Client Service Associate"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Client Service Associate in Rockland, NYFormer Employee - Client Service Associate in Rockland, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at Sterling Bancorp full-time (More than a year)ProsThe best reason to work for this bank is that you have a job and work with mostly good people.ConsThe pay is fairly low with virtually no raises. They expect you to do sales referrals but, unlike just about every other bank, they don't pay you for them. Management pushes for sales and outstanding customer service with the hopes of getting bonuses but doesn't tell you the bonuses are not for you but just them. The technology is very outdated and the systems go down at least once a week and their IT department seems clueless as far as fixing them. Their is virtually no training. Customers constantly talk about how much better the bank was before all the mergers.Advice to ManagementStep into the 21st century with your technology and if you insist that they sell or refer your product pay your front line employees for doing so.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Sterling Bancorp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sterling Bancorp 2016-07-24 08:20 PDT Join the Sterling Bancorp team See Our Latest Jobs Jul 15, 2016"Client Service Associate"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Yonkers, NYFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Yonkers, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Sterling Bancorp full-timeProsNone- You have a job.Glad to have been laid off while this outrageous changes with in the bank.ConsAcquiring bank to lay off many employees. Customers are very disappointed because they were forced to deal with THIER community bank closing. Head management never addresses questions but beat around the bush. Financial centers have many procedures with a ripped apart, thinned out staff. Salary was changed when conversion happened which was very difficult to adjust to after so many years.Advice to ManagementThink about every one else that comes to work and first handily services the customers. Hudson valley bank NEVER treated customers as a number that's what made us different. They should understand the staff isn't robots and working in an environment like that is not very welcoming.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Sterling Bancorp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sterling Bancorp 2016-07-15 14:30 PDT May 22, 2016"Yes, I know how to review and clear titles and surveys"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsCurrent Employee - Mortgage Loan Processor in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Mortgage Loan Processor in New York, NYI have been working at Sterling Bancorp full-time (More than 3 years)ProsI work with wonderful peopleConsWe may not be employed for long with this companyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Sterling Bancorp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sterling Bancorp 2016-05-22 18:21 PDT Jun 17, 2016"Horrendous"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYDisapproves of CEOProsNone to list unless change is made in the near future.ConsToo many to list.

Not a well-run organization, with erosion of the former service brand and a very high turnover, with indifference to the talent that has left the organization. Management trend is to clear-out acquired company's staff, which has resulted in a significant talent drain. Company seems to follow the Project Runway mantra: "one day you are in and the next day you are out."Advice to ManagementThis is a short-term, get the company ready for sale business strategy. Long-term, it will erode the franchise value and inhibit ability to grow, cultivate and retain high quality talent.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Sterling Bancorp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sterling Bancorp 2016-03-03 06:14 PST Jan 13, 2016"Can't complain"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Customer Service Associate I in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Customer Service Associate I in New York, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Sterling Bancorp full-time (More than a year)ProsThe employees are the best thing about working here.

Would be nice to you one minute, then would turn on you forgetting that they were nice to you just minutes before. It was like walking on egg shells. Made for an uncomfortable working environment.

Kitchen Sinks FAQs



Q: 
What is Vikrell®?


Solid Vikrell material by Sterling offers exceptional strength combined with resistance to chipping, cracking and peeling. Vikrell is a solid composite material made of resins, fiberglass and filler that is exclusive to Kohler Company. The material is compression molded in large presses to form baths and wall surrounds that are structurally rigid yet lightweight and feature a non-porous surface that is easy to clean. Click here to learn more about Vikrell material. 



Q: 
Is higher or lower gauge steel better?


The lower the gauge, the thicker the steel. Thick steel is less likely to dent and is more sound resistant.



Q: 
What is SilentShield® technology?


SilentShield sound-deadening pads are applied to all STERLING sinks creating a quieter sink (from clanging disposal or silverware) versus many competitors. The sound-deadening technology was borrowed from the auto industry.

Bathtubs FAQs



Q: 
What is the difference between a right-hand and left-hand bath?


When looking at a whirlpool or bath, you must establish the reference point, which is the entry side or threshold. From the entry side of the whirlpool or bath, the drain location determines whether the unit is right-hand or left-hand.  An right-hand bath has its drain on the right side and a left-hand bath has its drain on the left side.



Q: 
What is the removable apron option?


The apron or skirt, covers the front of a bath or whirlpool.  A removable apron allows limited access to the pump/motor and to plumbing system components on the apron side of the unit.



Q: 
The bathtub in my home measures 58" but I cannot find a STERLING bathtub for that size?


The standard size for bathtubs is 60" and are installed in the rough stage of construction (against the studs). After rough installation a 1/2" of wall board and a 1/2" of tile is typically added on top of the studs at each end of the bath making a finished installation roughly 58".

History[edit]
The entity now known as Sterling was founded in 1888 under the name Provident Bank. It later became a subsidiary of Provident New York Bancorp.[5]
On August 10, 2012, the company acquired Gotham Bank of New York, which enabled the company to expand into the New York City marketplace.[6]
On October 31, 2013, the company acquired Sterling Bancorp through a merger. Provident changed its legal name to Sterling Bancorp and the name of its principal banking subsidiary to Sterling National Bank. The merger was intended to create a larger, more diversified company with a broader range of products and services for small-to-middle market commercial clients and consumers.[2]
On June 30, 2015, Sterling completed the acquisition of Hudson Valley Holding Corp., which further expanded its presence in the greater New York Metropolitan region.[2]
The company also made smaller acquisitions to add specialized products and services, most recently including Damian Services Corp., a payroll financing business (acquired March 2, 2015),[7] and a factoring portfolio from First Capital Corp. (acquired May 18, 2015).[8]
Through these acquisitions Sterling has expanded its range of services and market presence while providing opportunities for cost efficiencies and higher revenues and earnings.[2]
Differentiation[edit]
The company is pursuing a strategy of becoming a high-performing banking institution with a focus on serving small to middle market commercial businesses and affluent consumers. The bank believes this client segment is frequently underserved by larger bank competitors in its market area. Sterling employs a team-based strategy in which each client is served by relationship team that provides a single point of contact for delivering the bank’s products and services and manages all aspects of the client relationship.[2]
