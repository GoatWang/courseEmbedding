        Top 30 Venture Capital Firms of 2013
    

        Who are the big spenders that help grease the wheels of biotech?
    


Alex  Philippidis





This year’s list has been expanded to a top 30 in part to include the higher number of firms with funds totaling more than $1.1 billion compared with 2012. [Bobby4237 - Fotolia.com]









Just last week, a new biotech company called Juno Therapeutics was launched to the tune of $120 million in Series A financing. Where did this money come from? From the generous coffers of venture capital firms, including ARCH Venture Partners and the Alaska Permanent Fund. Such it is with every startup—venture capital is part of what makes new biotechs and biopharmas blossom. So, which VC companies invested money in those fields this year? Below is a list of 30 top venture capital firms, and broader financial firms that invest venture capital or other equity in early- to late-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, ranked by total capital under management or, for some firms, total active “committed” capital from funds in use.
This year’s list has been expanded to a top 30, in order to paint a more complete picture of biopharma venture investment and its key players—as well as to include the higher number of firms with funds totaling more than $1.1 billion compared with 2012.
The firms themselves are the sources of much of the information, though in some instances they have declined comment on news reports that they are raising additional capital; those instances are included in footnotes where the companies have not challenged the accuracy of the reports. In a handful of instances, figures and facts came from biographies of the firms’ principals available on the websites of investee companies and publicly available investor presentations posted online.
Interestingly, this year, five firms listed closed on new funds—less than the seven that did so last year, but a still-significant sign that more firms resumed raising new capital following years of near-standstill wrought by the 2007–09 recession.

        Top 30 Venture Capital Firms of 2013
    

        Who are the big spenders that help grease the wheels of biotech?
    


Alex  Philippidis





This year’s list has been expanded to a top 30 in part to include the higher number of firms with funds totaling more than $1.1 billion compared with 2012. [Bobby4237 - Fotolia.com]









Just last week, a new biotech company called Juno Therapeutics was launched to the tune of $120 million in Series A financing. Where did this money come from? From the generous coffers of venture capital firms, including ARCH Venture Partners and the Alaska Permanent Fund. Such it is with every startup—venture capital is part of what makes new biotechs and biopharmas blossom. So, which VC companies invested money in those fields this year? Below is a list of 30 top venture capital firms, and broader financial firms that invest venture capital or other equity in early- to late-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, ranked by total capital under management or, for some firms, total active “committed” capital from funds in use.
This year’s list has been expanded to a top 30, in order to paint a more complete picture of biopharma venture investment and its key players—as well as to include the higher number of firms with funds totaling more than $1.1 billion compared with 2012.
The firms themselves are the sources of much of the information, though in some instances they have declined comment on news reports that they are raising additional capital; those instances are included in footnotes where the companies have not challenged the accuracy of the reports. In a handful of instances, figures and facts came from biographies of the firms’ principals available on the websites of investee companies and publicly available investor presentations posted online.
Interestingly, this year, five firms listed closed on new funds—less than the seven that did so last year, but a still-significant sign that more firms resumed raising new capital following years of near-standstill wrought by the 2007–09 recession.

	Annual Report on

	Form 10-K

	(Annual Report).



	Solicitation



	This solicitation is made on behalf of the Board of Directors. We will bear the costs of preparing, mailing, online processing and other costs
	of the proxy solicitation made by our Board of Directors. Certain of our officers and employees may solicit the submission of proxies authorizing the voting of shares in accordance with the Board of Directors recommendations. Such
	solicitations may be made by email, telephone, facsimile transmission or personal solicitation. No additional compensation will be paid to such officers, directors or regular employees for such services. We will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and
	other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable


	out-of-pocket


	expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to stockholders.



	Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials



	In accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), instead of mailing a printed copy of
	our proxy materials to each stockholder of record, the Company may furnish proxy materials via the internet. Accordingly, all of the Companys stockholders will receive a Notice, to be mailed on or about April 28, 2017.


	On the date of mailing the Notice, stockholders will be able to access all of the proxy materials on the website at

	www.proxyvote.com

	.
	The proxy materials will be available free of charge. The Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials (including the Annual Report) over the internet or through other
	methods specified on the website. The website contains instructions as to how to vote by internet or over the telephone. The Notice also instructs you as to how you may request a paper or email copy of the proxy card. If you received a Notice and
	would like to receive printed copies of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions included in the Notice for requesting such materials.

	Voting Rights and Outstanding Shares



	Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on April 21, 2017 are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote
	at, the Annual Meeting. Each holder of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on April 21, 2017, there were 43,622,095 shares of common stock
	issued and outstanding.


	A quorum of stockholders is necessary to take action at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders representing a majority
	of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date (present in person or represented by proxy) will constitute a quorum. We will appoint an inspector of elections for the meeting to determine whether or not a quorum is present and
	to tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions, withheld votes and broker

	non-votes

	(which occur when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does
	not vote on a particular matter because such broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner) are counted as present for purposes of
	determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.





	Votes Required for Each Proposal



	To elect our directors and approve the other proposals being considered at the Annual Meeting, the voting requirements are as follows:


	 


























	Proposal




	  



	Vote

	Required



	 


	  



	Discretionary Voting

	Permitted?



	 





	Election of Directors



	  


	 


	Plurality


	 


	  


	 


	No


	 





	Ratification of KPMG LLP



	  


	 


	Majority


	 


	  


	 


	Yes


	 






	Discretionary


	Voting


	Permitted

	means that brokers will have discretionary
	voting authority with respect to shares held in street name for their clients, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from their client.





	Majority

	means a majority of the votes properly cast for and against such matter.




	Plurality

	means a plurality of the votes properly cast on such matter. For the election of directors, the two nominees
	receiving the plurality of votes entitled to vote and cast will be elected as directors.


	The vote required and method of calculation for
	the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting are as follows:



	Proposal


	OneElection


	of


	Directors.

	If a quorum is present, the two director nominees receiving the highest number of votes, in person or by proxy, will be elected as directors. You may vote FOR all nominees, WITHHOLD for all nominees, or WITHHOLD
	for any nominee by specifying the name of the nominee on your proxy card. Proposal One is not considered to be a discretionary item, so if you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to this proposal, your broker may not vote on this
	proposal, and those votes will be counted as broker

	non-votes.

	Withheld votes and broker

	non-votes

	will have no effect on the outcome of the election of the
	directors.



	Proposal


	TwoApproval


	of


	the


	Ratification


	of


	KPMG




	 LLP


	as


	Independent


	Registered


	Public


	Accounting


	Firm.

	Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and against such matter. You may vote FOR,
	AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting on this proposal. If you abstain from voting on this matter, your shares will not be counted as votes cast with respect to such matter, and the abstention will have no effect on the
	proposal. Proposal Two is considered to be a discretionary item, and your broker will be able to vote on this proposal even if it does not receive instructions from you. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that there will be any broker

	non-votes

	on this proposal; however, any broker

	non-votes

	will not be counted as votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the proposal.

	Table of Contents



	We request that you vote your shares by proxy following the methods as instructed by the Notice:
	over the Internet, by telephone or by mail. If you choose to vote by mail, your shares will be voted in accordance with your voting instructions if the proxy card is received prior to or at the Annual Meeting. If you sign and return your proxy card
	but do not give voting instructions, your shares will be voted FOR (i) the election of each of the Companys two (2) nominees as Class II directors; (ii) the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the
	independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017; and (iii) as the proxy holders deem advisable, in their discretion, on other matters that may properly come before the Annual
	Meeting.



	Voting by Proxy Over the Internet or by Telephone



	Stockholders whose shares are registered in their own names may vote by proxy by mail, over the Internet or by telephone. Instructions for
	voting by proxy over the Internet or by telephone are set forth on the Notice. The Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 19, 2017. The Notice will also provide instructions on how you can
	elect to receive future proxy materials electronically or in printed form by mail. If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to the proxy materials and a
	link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials electronically or in printed form by mail will remain in effect until you terminate such election.


	If your shares are held in street name, the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee should indicate whether
	the institution has a process for beneficial holders to provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. A number of banks and brokerage firms participate in a program that also permits stockholders whose shares are held in street name
	to direct their vote over the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm gives you this opportunity, the voting instructions from the bank or brokerage firm that accompany this Proxy Statement will tell you how to use the Internet or
	telephone to direct the vote of shares held in your account. If your voting instruction form does not include Internet or telephone information, please complete and return the voting instruction form in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope
	provided by your broker. Stockholders who vote by proxy over the Internet or by telephone need not return a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail, but may incur costs, such as usage charges, from telephone companies or Internet service
	providers.



	Revocability of Proxies



	Any proxy may be revoked at any time before it is exercised by filing an instrument revoking it with the Companys Secretary or by
	submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date prior to the time of the Annual Meeting. Stockholders who have voted by proxy over the Internet or by telephone or have executed and returned a proxy and who then attend the Annual Meeting and
	desire to vote in person are requested to notify the Secretary in writing prior to the time of the Annual Meeting. We request that all such written notices of revocation to the Company be addressed to Tricia Suvari, Secretary, c/o Global Blood
	Therapeutics, Inc., at the address of our principal executive offices at 400 East Jamie Court, Suite 101, South San Francisco, CA 94080. Our telephone number is

	(650) 741-7700.

	Stockholders may
	also revoke their proxy by entering a new vote over the Internet or by telephone before these voting facilities close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 19, 2017.






	Stockholder Proposals to be Presented at the Next Annual Meeting



	Any stockholder who meets the requirements of the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
	Act), may submit proposals to the Board of Directors to be presented at the 2018 annual meeting. Such proposals must comply with the requirements of

	Rule 14a-8

	under the Exchange Act and be
	submitted in writing by notice delivered or mailed by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, to our Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above no later than December 27, 2017 in order to be considered for
	inclusion in the proxy materials to be disseminated by the Board of Directors for such

	Table of Contents



	annual meeting. If the date of the 2018 annual meeting is moved by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous years proxy statement, then notice must be
	received within a reasonable time before we begin to print and send proxy materials. If that happens, we will publicly announce the deadline for submitting a proposal in a press release or in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission (the SEC). A proposal submitted outside the requirements of

	Rule 14a-8

	under the Exchange Act will be considered untimely if received after March 12, 2018.


	Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) also provide for separate notice procedures to recommend a person for nomination as a
	director or to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting. To be considered timely under these provisions, the stockholders notice must be received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set
	forth above no earlier than February 20, 2018 and no later than March 22, 2018. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders notice.


	The Board of Directors, a designated committee thereof or the chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the introduction of any
	stockholder proposal if it is not made in compliance with the applicable notice provisions.

	include nearly 30 years of experience in leading biotechnology research and development in small, large, public and private biotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms.



	Board of Directors Role in Risk Management



	Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks,
	including risks relating to our financial condition, development and commercialization activities, clinical and regulatory matters, operations and intellectual property. Management is responsible for the


	day-to-day


	management of risks we face, while our Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our Board of
	Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed.


	The role of our Board of Directors in overseeing the management of our risks is conducted primarily through committees of the Board of
	Directors, as disclosed in the descriptions of each of the committees below and in the charters of each of the committees. The full Board of Directors (or the appropriate board committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a
	particular committee) discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our company, and the steps we take to manage them. When a board committee is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the management of a particular
	risk or risks, the chairman

	of the relevant committee reports on the discussion to the full Board of Directors during the committee reports portion of the next board meeting. This enables our Board of Directors and its
	committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.



	Compensation Risk Assessment



	We believe that although a portion of the compensation provided to our executive officers and other employees is performance-based, our
	executive compensation program does not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking. This is primarily due to the fact that our compensation programs are designed to encourage our executive officers and other employees to remain focused on both
	short-term and long-term strategic goals, in particular in connection with our


	pay-for-performance


	compensation philosophy. As a result, we do not believe that our
	compensation programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.



	Board of Directors and Committees of the Board



	During 2016, the Board of Directors held a total of six meetings. All directors attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings,
	except that Dr. Homcy attended four of the six meetings, and all directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of Board committees on which the director served during the time he served on the Board or such committees.


	Our Board of Directors has determined that all of our directors, except for Dr. Love, are independent, as determined in accordance with
	the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) and the SEC. In making such independence determination, the Board of Directors considered the relationships that each

	non-employee

	director has with us
	and all other facts and circumstances that the Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each

	non-employee

	director. In
	considering the independence of the directors listed above, our Board of Directors also considered the association of our directors with the holders of more than 5% of our common stock. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or
	executive officers.


	The Board of Directors has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance
	Committee and Research and Development Committee. Each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is composed entirely of independent directors in accordance with current NASDAQ listing
	standards. Furthermore, our Audit Committee meets the enhanced independence standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rulemaking of the SEC. Copies of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate
	Governance Committee charters and our corporate governance guidelines are available, free of charge, on our website at http://www.globalbloodtx.com, under the Investors & Media/Corporate Governance link.

	Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to retain compensation
	consultants to assist in its evaluation of executive and director compensation. The Compensation Committee engaged Compensia, Inc. (Compensia) and Arnosti, Inc. (Arnosti) as compensation consultants in 2016. The Compensation
	Committee instructed the consultants to develop a peer group of companies to assess the competitiveness of the executive, equity and Board of Directors compensation programs and to review the Companys equity program and broader equity
	practices. Our Compensation Committee plans to retain one or more third-party compensation advisors to provide similar information and advice in future years for consideration in establishing overall compensation for the Companys executives
	and directors. We do not believe the retention of, and the work performed by, Compensia and Arnosti creates any conflict of interest.


	During 2016, Mr. Perry, Mr. Bonney, Mr. Patrick and Dr. Homcy served on the Compensation Committee and the Committee held
	seven meetings. Effective as of March 10, 2016, Mr. Bonney was appointed as a member of the Compensation Committee, and Dr. Homcy resigned as a member of the Compensation Committee.

	meetings.



	Board Leadership



	We do
	not currently have a Chairman of the Board, but we have appointed Mark L. Perry to serve as our lead independent director. We believe that the appointment of a lead independent director allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our


	day-to-day


	business, while allowing the lead independent director to lead our Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of
	management. Our Board of Directors recognizes the time, effort and energy that the Chief Executive Officer is required to devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as the commitment required to serve as our lead independent
	director, particularly as our Board of Directors oversight responsibilities continue to grow.


	While our Bylaws and corporate
	governance guidelines do not require that we appoint a separate Chairman of the Board or lead independent director and Chief Executive Officer, our Board of Directors believes that having a Chief Executive Officer and a separate designated lead
	independent director is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance. Our separated lead independent director and Chief Executive Officer positions are augmented by the
	independence of eight of our nine directors, and our entirely independent Board committees that provide appropriate oversight in the areas described above. At executive sessions of independent directors, these directors speak candidly on any matter
	of interest, without the Chief Executive Officer or other executives present. The independent directors met four times in 2016 without management present. We believe this structure provides consistent and effective oversight of our management and
	the Company.



	Director Nominations



	The director qualifications developed to date focus on what our Board believes to be essential competencies to effectively serve on the Board
	of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reassesses such criteria from time to time and submits any proposed changes to the Board of


	 


	12







	Table of Contents



	Directors for approval. Presently, at a minimum, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must be satisfied that each nominee it recommends (i) has experience at a strategic or
	policymaking level in a business, government,

	non-profit

	or academic organization of high standing, (ii) is highly accomplished in his or her respective field, with superior credentials and recognition,
	(iii) is well regarded in the community and has a long-term reputation for high ethical and moral standards, (iv) has sufficient time and availability to devote to the affairs of the Company, particularly in light of the number of boards
	of directors on which such nominee may serve, and (v) to the extent such nominee serves or has previously served on other boards, the nominee has a demonstrated history of actively contributing at board meetings.


	In addition to those minimum qualifications, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends that our Board of Directors select
	persons for nomination to help ensure that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a majority of our Board is independent in accordance with NASDAQ standards;




	 




	 


	


	 


	each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee be comprised entirely of independent directors; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	at least one member of the Audit Committee shall have the experience, education and other qualifications necessary to qualify as an Audit Committee financial expert as defined by the rules of the SEC.




	In addition to other standards the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may deem appropriate from time to time for
	the overall structure and compensation of the Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider the following factors when recommending that our Board select persons for nomination:


	 




	 


	


	 


	whether a nominee has direct experience in the biotechnology or pharmaceuticals industry or in other fields relevant to the Companys operations; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	whether the nominee, if elected, assists in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a diversity of background and experience.




	Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider whether nominees assist in achieving a mix of Board members that
	represents a diversity of background and experience, which is not only limited to race, gender or national origin, we have no formal policy regarding board diversity.


	The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee adheres to the following process for identifying and evaluating nominees for the Board of
	Directors. First, it solicits recommendations for nominees from non-management directors, our Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers, third-party search firms or any other source it deems appropriate. The Nominating and Corporate
	Governance Committee then reviews and evaluates the qualifications of proposed nominees and conducts inquiries it deems appropriate; all proposed nominees are evaluated in the same manner, regardless of who initially recommended such nominee. In
	reviewing and evaluating proposed nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider, in addition to the minimum qualifications and other criteria for Board membership approved by our Board from time to time, all facts and
	circumstances that it deems appropriate or advisable, including, among other things, the skills of the proposed nominee, his or her depth and breadth of business experience or other background characteristics, his or her independence and the needs
	of the Board.


	If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee decides to retain a third-party search firm to identify proposed
	nominees, it has sole authority to retain and terminate such firm and to approve any such firms fees and other retention terms.


	Each nominee for election as director at the 2017 Annual Meeting is recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and is
	presently a director and stands for

	re-election

	by the stockholders.

	Table of Contents



	One of our current Class II directors, Michael W. Bonney, will not stand for

	re-election

	at the Annual Meeting. From time to time, the Company may pay
	fees to third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees, although no such fees have been paid in connection with nominations to be acted upon at the 2017 Annual Meeting.


	Pursuant to our Bylaws, stockholders who wish to nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting must be a
	stockholder of record at the time of giving the notice, entitled to vote at the meeting, present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting and must comply with the notice procedures in our Bylaws. A stockholders notice of nomination to be made at
	an annual meeting must be delivered to our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting. However, if an annual meeting is more than
	30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, the notice must be delivered no later than the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which the first public
	announcement of the date of such annual meeting was made. A stockholders notice of nomination may not be made at a special meeting unless such special meeting is held in lieu of an annual meeting. The stockholders notice must include the
	following information for the person making the nomination:

	the class and number of shares of the Company owned beneficially or of record;




	 




	 


	


	 


	disclosure regarding any derivative, swap or other transactions which give the nominating person economic risk similar to ownership of shares of the Company or provide the opportunity to profit from an increase in the
	price of value of shares of the Company;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any proxy (other than a revocable proxy given in response to a public proxy solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Exchange Act), agreement, arrangement, understanding or relationship that confers a
	right to vote any shares of the Company;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any agreement, arrangement, understanding or relationship engaged in for the purpose of acquiring, holding, disposing or voting of any shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Company;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any rights to dividends or other distributions on the shares that are separate from the underlying shares;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any performance-related fees that the nominating person is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of any shares of the Company;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a description of all agreements, arrangements or understandings by and between the proposing stockholder and another person relating to the proposed business (including an identification of each party to such agreement,

	


	 


	a statement whether or not the proposing stockholder will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a business proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all shares of capital
	stock required to approve the proposal or, in the case of director nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock reasonably believed by the proposing stockholder to be sufficient to elect the nominee; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other information relating to the nominating person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement filed with the SEC.




	With respect to proposed director nominees, the stockholders notice must include all information required to be disclosed in a proxy
	statement in connection with a contested election of directors or otherwise required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to
	serving as a director if elected).

	Table of Contents



	For matters other than the election of directors, the stockholders notice must also include
	a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of the stockholder(s) proposing the business.


	The stockholders notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information required to be provided in the notice is
	true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting.


	The Board of
	Directors, a designated committee thereof or the chairman of the meeting will determine if the procedures in our Bylaws have been followed, and if not, declare that the proposal or nomination be disregarded. The nominee must be willing to provide
	any other information reasonably requested by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in connection with its evaluation of the nominees independence. There have been no material changes to the process by which stockholders may
	recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.



	Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors



	Stockholders may send correspondence to the Board of Directors c/o the lead independent director of the Board at our principal executive
	offices at the address set forth above. The Company will forward all correspondence addressed to the Board or any individual Board member. Stockholders may also communicate online with our Board of Directors as a group by accessing our website
	(www.globalbloodtx.com) and selecting the Investors & Media tab.



	Director Attendance at Annual Meetings



	Directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting. Six of our directors attended the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.






	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

	Director Compensation



	In July 2015, our Board of Directors adopted a

	non-employee

	director compensation policy, which became
	effective upon the completion of our initial public offering in August 2015. The policy is designed to provide a total compensation package that enables us to attract and retain, on a long-term basis, high-caliber

	non-employee

	directors. This policy was subsequently amended by our Board of Directors on September 8, 2016. Under this policy, all

	non-employee

	directors are paid
	cash compensation for service on the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors as set forth below, prorated based on days of service during a calendar year.

	In addition, under the
	policy, each new

	non-employee

	director who is initially appointed or elected to our Board of Directors will receive an option grant to purchase up to 30,000 shares of common stock, which will vest in equal
	monthly installments during the 36 months following the grant date, subject to the directors continued service on our Board of Directors. Thereafter, on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, each continuing

	non-employee

	director will be eligible to receive an annual option grant to purchase up to 15,000 shares of common stock, which will vest in equal monthly installments during the 12 months following the date of
	grant, subject to the directors continued service on our Board of Directors. All stock options granted to our

	non-employee

	directors pursuant to this policy are subject to full acceleration of vesting
	upon the consummation of a sale event. Our

	non-employee

	directors may also be granted such additional stock options in such amounts and on such dates as our Board of Directors may recommend. All of the
	foregoing options will be granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and will be exercisable (to the extent vested) for up to one year following cessation of the directors service on
	our Board of Directors, so long as the director was not removed for cause.


	We have agreed to reimburse all reasonable


	out-of-pocket


	expenses incurred by

	non-employee

	directors in attending Board and committee meetings.

	PROPOSAL 2






	RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for 2017. Representatives
	of KPMG LLP will attend the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.


	The Companys organizational documents do not require that the stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as the Companys
	independent registered public accounting firm, and stockholder ratification is not binding on the Company, the Board or the Audit Committee. The Company requests such ratification, however, as a matter of good corporate practice. The ratification of
	the selection of KPMG LLP requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. Our Board, including our Audit Committee, values the opinions of our stockholders and, to the extent there is any
	significant vote against the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders concerns and evaluate what actions may be appropriate to address those concerns, although the
	Audit Committee, in its discretion, may still retain KPMG LLP.


	The following table shows information about fees billed to the
	Company by KPMG LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	Audit fees of KPMG LLP for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were for professional services rendered for the audits of our financial statements, including accounting consultation, reviews of quarterly
	financial statements and professional services rendered in connection with our registration statements. Fees for 2016 include services associated with our

	follow-on

	public offering, which was completed in June
	2016, and fees for 2015 include services associated with our initial public offering, which was completed in August 2015.

	Committee

	Pre-Approval

	Policies



	The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the
	appointment, retention and termination, and for determining the compensation, of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee shall

	pre-approve

	all auditing services
	and the terms thereof and

	non-audit

	services (other than

	non-audit

	services prohibited under Section 10A(g) of the Exchange Act or the applicable rules of the SEC
	or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board), except that

	pre-approval

	is not required for the provision of

	non-audit

	services if the de minimus
	provisions of Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act are satisfied. The Audit Committee may delegate to the chairperson of the Audit Committee the authority to grant

	pre-approvals

	for audit and

	non-audit

	services, provided such approvals are presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All services provided by KPMG LLP during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 (following our initial public
	offering) were

	pre-approved

	by the Audit Committee in accordance with the

	pre-approval

	policy described above.

	Required Vote



	The ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual
	Meeting (meaning the number of shares voted for the proposal must exceed the number of shares voted against the proposal). Abstentions are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose, and will have no effect on the
	vote for this proposal.



	Recommendation of the Board of Directors




	The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the independent
	registered public accounting firm of the Company for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.

	In accordance with SEC rules, these columns reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock and option awards granted during 2016 and 2015 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Pursuant to FASB ASC
	Topic 718, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. For additional information on the valuation assumptions underlying the value of restricted stock and options, see

	The amounts reported for 2016 reflect the cash incentive compensation determined by our Compensation Committee (for the Named Executive Officers other than the CEO), and by our Board of Directors upon recommendation of
	our Compensation Committee (for our CEO), based on achievement of certain research and development, clinical, financial and operational metrics related to our 2016 corporate objectives, as specified by our Board of Directors.






	(3)


	The amounts reported in this column consist of employer matching contributions received by Dr. Love, Mr. Farrow and Ms. Suvari in connection with the Companys 401(k) plan benefits, described in
	greater detail below, and certain termination benefits paid to Dr. Ramos, as described in greater detail below.

	Ms. Suvari joined us in October 2016, and the amount reported in the salary column reflects her partial year of service with us. In addition, Ms. Suvari was paid a

	one-time

	cash bonus on January 31, 2017, which we deemed to be compensation earned in 2017 and is not included in the table above.






	(7)


	Dr. Ramos employment with the Company ended effective October 24, 2016. We entered into a Termination Letter Agreement with Dr. Ramos, effective November 7, 2016, which provided for the payment
	of cash severance, the continuation of certain benefits, and accelerated vesting for certain of Dr. Ramos outstanding stock options. See Termination Agreement with Eleanor L. Ramos, M.D., below, for further details.

	Base


	Salaries.

	Our Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named executive
	officers, from time to time and makes adjustments (or, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, may recommend adjustments for approval by the Board of Directors) as it determines to be reasonable and necessary to reflect the scope of the
	executive officers performance, contributions, responsibilities, experience, prior salary level, position (in the case of a promotion) and market conditions, including base salary amounts relative to similarly situated executive officers at
	peer group companies.



	Cash


	Incentive


	Compensation.

	In January 2016, the Board of Directors adopted the
	Companys Senior Executive Cash Incentive Bonus Plan (the Incentive Plan), which applies to certain key executives (the Covered Executives), that are recommended by the Compensation Committee and selected by the Board of
	Directors. The Incentive Plan provides for bonus payments based upon the attainment of performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee and related to operational and financial metrics with respect to the Company or any of its
	subsidiaries (the Corporate Performance Goals), which may include achievement of specified research and development, publication, clinical and/or regulatory milestones, total shareholder return, earnings before interest, taxes,
	depreciation and amortization, net income (loss) (either before or after interest, taxes, depreciation, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and/or amortization), changes in the market price of the Companys common stock, economic
	value-added, funds from operations or similar measure, sales or revenue, acquisitions or strategic transactions, operating income (loss), cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow and free cash flow), return on capital, assets,
	equity, or investment, return on sales, gross or net profit levels, productivity, expense, margins, operating efficiency, customer satisfaction, working capital, earnings (loss) per share of the Companys common stock; bookings, new bookings or
	renewals; sales or market shares; number of customers, number of new customers or customer references; operating income and/or net annual recurring revenue. Any bonuses paid under the Incentive Plan will be based upon objectively determinable bonus
	formulas that tie such bonuses to one or more performance targets relating to the Corporate Performance Goals. The bonus formulas will be adopted in each performance period by the Compensation Committee and communicated to each Covered Executive. No
	bonuses will be paid under the Incentive Plan unless and until the Compensation Committee makes a determination with respect to the attainment of the performance objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee may adjust
	bonuses payable under the Incentive Plan based on achievement of individual performance goals or pay bonuses (including, without limitation, discretionary bonuses) to Covered Executives under the Incentive Plan based on individual performance goals
	and/or upon such other terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may in its discretion determine.

	Incentive


	Compensation.

	Historically, we have generally granted stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, in connection with their initial employment with us. Beginning in 2017, our practice is to grant a combination of
	stock options and restricted stock units to our employees, including executive officers, in connection with their initial employment with us. Prior to our initial

	public offering in August 2015, we granted to employees, including certain of our named executive officers, at their election, shares of restricted stock purchased at fair market value, as
	determined by our Board of Directors at the time of grant. We also have historically granted stock options and prior to our initial public offering, in the case of certain of our named executive officers, at their election, shares of restricted
	stock purchased at fair market value, as determined by our Board of Directors at the time of grant on an annual basis as part of annual performance reviews of our employees. Beginning in 2017, our equity award grant policy also contemplates the
	grant of stock options and restricted stock units to existing employees, including our named executive officers, in connection with annual performance evaluations.

	Dr. Love purchased 21,428 shares of our restricted common stock under our 2012 Stock Option and Grant Plan (the 2012 Plan) on September 4, 2013 in connection with joining our Board of Directors. Of

	Dr. Love purchased 201,428 shares of our restricted common stock under our 2012 Plan on April 9, 2015 in connection with an annual replenishment grant. Of this total, 1/16th of the shares of restricted common

	Dr. Love purchased 99,285 shares of our restricted common stock under our 2012 Plan on April 9, 2015. Of this total, 25% of the shares are subject to vesting upon the achievement of each of four
	(4) specified corporate operating milestones on or before certain specified dates, subject to Dr. Loves continuous service through each such vesting date. On March 10, 2016 and September 29, 2016, the Compensation Committee
	determined that two of the four corporate milestones were met within the specified timeline and accordingly 49,643 shares of the restricted common stock in column (i) vested. In addition, one of the four corporate milestones was not met within
	the specified timeline and accordingly, 24,821 shares of the restricted common stock were cancelled during 2016.

	Dr. Love purchased 99,285 shares of our restricted common stock under our 2012 Plan on April 9, 2015. The shares will not vest until our market capitalization (determined based on the number of shares of
	common stock outstanding multiplied by the closing market price for our common stock as reported on NASDAQ) exceeds at least $2.0 billion for 20 consecutive trading days on or before the date twenty-four (24) months after the closing of
	our initial public offering (IPO), which was on August 11, 2015.






	(9)


	Mr. Farrow received a grant of an option to purchase 120,000 shares of our common stock under our 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) on February 24, 2016 in connection with the
	commencement of his service relationship with the Company, as an advisor. His full time employment with the Company commenced effective April 4, 2017. Of this total, 25% of the shares subject to the option vested on April 4, 2017, and the
	remaining shares vest quarterly over the following three years thereafter, subject to Mr. Farrows continuous service through each such vesting date.






	(10)


	Ms. Suvari received a grant of an option to purchase 100,000 shares of our Common Stock under our 2015 Plan on October 11, 2016 in connection with the commencement of her employment. 25% of the shares subject
	to the option will vest on October 11, 2017, and the remaining shares vest quarterly over the following three years thereafter, subject to Ms. Suvaris continuous service through each such vesting date.






	(11)


	Dr. Ramos employment ended effective October 24, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Dr. Ramos held outstanding stock options to purchase a total of 182,856 shares of common stock, and was entitled
	to exercise these stock options until ninety (90) days after her October 24, 2016 separation date under the terms of her Termination Letter Agreement with us.








	401(k) Savings Plan and Other Benefits






	We maintain a

	tax-qualified

	retirement plan, or 401(k) Plan, that provides eligible U.S. employees with
	an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax advantaged basis. Eligible employees are able to defer eligible compensation subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) limits. Employees

	pre-tax

	contributions are allocated to each participants individual account and are then invested in selected investment alternatives according to the participants directions. Employees are immediately
	and fully vested in their contributions. Our 401(k) Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code with our 401(k) Plans related trust intended to be tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. As a

	tax-qualified

	retirement plan, contributions to our 401(k) Plan and earnings and matching amounts on those contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from our 401(k) Plan. In December 2015, our
	Compensation Committee approved a 401(k) plan matching policy under which, effective as of January 1, 2016, subject to reassessment of the cap on matching for the calendar year thereafter, we match in cash 100% of employees 401(k)
	contributions up to the first $500 and, thereafter, we match in cash 50% of employees first 6% of 401(k) contributions, subject to a cap of $2,500 per employee. In January 2017, our Compensation Committee approved a revised and simplified
	401(k) Plan matching policy under which, effective as of January 1, 2017, subject to reassessment of the cap on matching for the calendar year thereafter, we match in cash 50% of employees 401(k) contributions, subject to a cap of $2,500
	per employee. We also pay, on behalf of our employees, the premiums for health, life and disability insurance.



	Employment Arrangements with Our Named
	Executive Officers





	Change in Control Policy




	We consider it essential to the best interests of our stockholders to foster the continuous employment of our key management personnel. In this
	regard, we recognize that the possibility of a change in control may exist and that the uncertainty and questions that it may raise among management could result in the departure or

	Table of Contents



	distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and our stockholders. In order to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of certain key members of
	management, in July 2015, our Board of Directors adopted a Change in Control Policy, which was amended in January 2016 (the Policy). Pursuant to the Policy, in the event the employment of any of our named executive officers is terminated
	by us or our acquirer or successor without Cause or for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Policy) within one year after the consummation of a sale event, he or she will be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits, subject
	to his or her execution and

	non-revocation

	of a severance agreement within 60 days following the date of such termination, including a general release of claims:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a lump sum cash payment equal to nine months (or 12 months in the case of Dr. Love as our CEO) of the named executive officers then-current base salary;




	 




	 


	


	 


	payment of the named executive officers target annual incentive compensation;




	 




	 


	


	 


	if the named executive officer elects to continue his or her group healthcare benefits, payment of an amount equal to the monthly employer contribution we would have made to provide the named executive officer with
	health insurance if he or she had remained employed by us until the earlier of (i) nine months (or 12 months in the case of Dr. Love as our CEO) following the date of termination or (ii) the end of the named executive officers
	COBRA health continuation period; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all time-based stock options and other stock-based awards granted to the named executive officer will become fully exercisable and

	non-forfeitable

	and all performance-based awards
	will accelerate and vest based on the deemed achievement of 100% of target levels as of the date of the named executive officers termination.




	In addition, upon a sale event, to the extent Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is applicable, each named
	executive officer who is then employed with us will be entitled to receive the better treatment of: (i) payment of the full amounts set forth above to which the named executive officer is entitled or (ii) payment of such lesser amount that
	does not trigger excise taxes under Section 280G.


	Employees who are party to an agreement or an arrangement with the Company that
	provides greater benefits in the aggregate than set forth in the Policy are not eligible to receive any payments or benefits under the Policy.


	In addition, we have also entered into a written employment agreement with each of our named executive officers that provides for other
	compensation and benefits, as described below.




	Ted W. Love, M.D.




	We entered into an

	at-will

	employment offer letter agreement with Dr. Love in May 2014, pursuant
	to which he began serving as our President and CEO in June 2014 (the CEO Employment Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement, Dr. Love is entitled to an annual base salary currently set at $525,000, subject
	to adjustment pursuant to our employee compensation policies in effect from time to time. Pursuant to the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement and the Incentive Plan, Dr. Love is eligible to receive annual incentive compensation at a target
	percentage (currently 60%) of his then-current annual base salary, as determined by our Board of Directors. In connection with his appointment as President and CEO, we issued Dr. Love 714,285 shares of our common stock pursuant to a restricted
	stock award agreement dated June 11, 2014.


	Dr. Loves employment under the CEO Employment Agreement is

	at-will.

	In the event that Dr. Loves employment is terminated by the Company without cause, we will provide certain termination benefits, including (i) continuation of base salary for a period of
	nine months after the effective date of termination and (ii) continuation of group health plan benefits to the extent authorized by and consistent with COBRA, with the cost of the regular premium for such benefits shared in the same relative
	proportion by us and Dr. Love as in


	 


	26







	Table of Contents



	effect on the effective date of termination until the earlier of (x) the date that is nine months after the effective date of termination and (y) the date Dr. Love becomes eligible
	for health benefits through another employer or otherwise becomes ineligible for COBRA, in each case, subject to Dr. Loves execution and

	non-revocation

	of a separation agreement and release,
	resignation from all positions with us and compliance with our instructions regarding Company property.


	Under the CEO Employment
	Agreement, the term cause is generally defined as follows:


	cause means (i) dishonest
	statements or acts with respect to us or any of our affiliates, or any current or prospective customers, suppliers vendors or other third parties with which such entity does business; (ii) commission of (A) a felony or (B) any
	misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud; (iii) failure to perform assigned duties and responsibilities to our reasonable satisfaction, which failure continues, in our reasonable judgment, after written notice by us;
	(iv) gross negligence, willful misconduct or insubordination with respect to us or any of our affiliates; or (v) material violation of any provision of any agreement(s) between Dr. Love and us relating to noncompetition,
	nonsolicitation, nondisclosure and/or assignment of inventions.


	Dr. Love is also eligible to receive certain post-termination
	compensation and benefits in connection with a change in control in accordance with the Policy described above.




	Jeffrey Farrow




	We entered into an employment offer letter agreement with Mr. Farrow, pursuant to which he assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer in
	April 2016. The agreement entitles Mr. Farrow to an annual base salary that is currently set at $415,000, subject to adjustment pursuant to our employee compensation policies in effect from time to time. Pursuant to the terms of his agreement
	and the Incentive Plan, Mr. Farrow is eligible to receive annual incentive compensation at a target percentage (currently 40%) of his then-current annual base salary, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
	Pursuant to the terms of his agreement, Mr. Farrow was issued an option to purchase 120,000 shares of our common stock on February 24, 2016.


	Mr. Farrow is also eligible to receive certain post-termination compensation and benefits in connection with a change in control in
	accordance with the Policy described above.




	Tricia Suvari




	We entered into an employment offer letter agreement with Ms. Suvari, pursuant to which she assumed the role of Chief Legal Officer in
	October 2016. The agreement entitles Ms. Suvari to an annual base salary that is currently set at $365,000, subject to adjustment pursuant to our employee compensation policies in effect from time to time. Pursuant to the terms of her agreement
	and the Incentive Plan, Ms. Suvari is eligible to receive annual incentive compensation at a target percentage (currently 40%) of her then-current annual base salary, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
	Pursuant to the terms of her agreement, Ms. Suvari was issued an option to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock on October 11, 2016.


	Ms. Suvari is also eligible to receive certain post-termination compensation and benefits in connection with a change in control in
	accordance with the Policy described above.



	Termination Letter Agreement with Eleanor L. Ramos, M.D.



	We entered into a termination letter agreement and release with Dr. Ramos on November 7, 2016 (the Termination
	Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Company agreed, in exchange for a full release of claims from Dr. Ramos, to (i) pay Dr. Ramos an aggregate of $190,000, which represented six additional months
	of her base salary, less applicable withholding, (ii) reimburse Dr. Ramos for certain benefits continuation through April 30, 2017 and (iii) accelerate the vesting of 54,999 shares subject to Dr. Ramos outstanding
	options.

	Includes the 2015 Plan and the ESPP, as well as our 2012 Plan. Our 2015 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase each January 1,
	beginning on January 1, 2016, by 4% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares as determined by the compensation committee of the Companys Board of
	Directors. Our ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January 1, from January 1, 2016 until January 1, 2025, by the lesser of (i) 3,000,000 shares of common stock,
	(ii) 1% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or (iii) such lesser amount of shares as determined by the compensation committee of the Companys Board of Directors. On
	January 1, 2017, the number of shares available for issuance under our 2015 Plan and our ESPP increased by 1,492,000 shares and 186,500 shares, respectively, pursuant to these provisions. These increases are not reflected in the table above. We
	no longer grant new awards under our 2012 Plan, and any awards previously granted under such plan prior to our initial public offering that are forfeited, canceled, reacquired by us prior to vesting satisfied without the issuance of stock or
	otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) are added to shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan.

	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND
	RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS



	The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership information of our common stock by:


	 




	 


	


	 


	each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock as of March 31, 2017;




	 




	 


	


	 


	each named executive officer;




	 




	 


	


	 


	each of our directors; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all of our executive officers and directors as a group.




	We have based our calculation of the
	percentage of beneficial ownership of 43,602,804 shares of common stock outstanding on March 31, 2017.


	Each individual or entity
	shown in the table has furnished information with respect to beneficial ownership. The information with respect to each individual or entity is as of March 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted. The information with respect to certain significant
	stockholders is based on filings by the beneficial owners with the SEC pursuant to section 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the SECs rules. These rules generally
	attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules include shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of
	stock options that are either immediately exercisable or exercisable on or before May 30, 2017, which is 60 days after March 31, 2017. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those
	options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities
	identified in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws.

	over 5,597,467 shares of common stock. Abigail P. Johnson is a Director, the Vice Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the President of FMR LLC. Members of the Johnson family including Abigail P. Johnson, are the predominant owners, directly or
	through trusts, of Series B voting common shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting power of FMR LLC. The Johnson family group and all other Series B shareholders have entered into a shareholders voting agreement under which all Series
	B voting common shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of Series B voting common shares. Accordingly, through their ownership of voting common shares and the execution of the shareholders voting agreement, members of the
	Johnson family may be deemed, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, to form a controlling group with respect to FMR LLC. Neither FMR LLC nor Abigail P. Johnson has the sole power to vote or direct the voting of the shares owned directly by the
	various investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act (Fidelity Funds) advised by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR LLC, which power resides with the

	SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE



	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our
	equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required to furnish us with copies of all such forms which they file.


	To our knowledge, based solely on our review of such reports or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all of
	the filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors, greater than 10% beneficial owners and other persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act were complied with during the year ended December 31, 2016, except that one Form
	4 filed on behalf of Dr. Love, to report the repurchase of unvested restricted stock that was forfeited, was filed late due to administrative error.



	The following Audit Committee Report is not considered proxy solicitation material and is not deemed filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Companys filings made under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act that might incorporate filings made by the Company under those statutes, the Audit
	Committee Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any prior filings or into any future filings made by the Company under those statutes.









	AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT



	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee) has furnished this report concerning the independent audit of
	the Companys financial statements. Each member of the Audit Committee meets the enhanced independence standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rulemaking of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and
	the NASDAQ Stock Market regulations. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the Companys website at http://www.globalbloodtx.com.


	The Audit Committees responsibilities include assisting the Board of Directors regarding the oversight of the integrity of the
	Companys financial statements, the Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence, and the performance of the independent registered
	public accounting firm.


	In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Companys
	financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 with the Companys management and KPMG LLP. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP, with and without management present, their evaluation of
	the Companys internal controls over financial reporting and overall quality of the Companys financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing
	Standards No. 114 (formerly SAS 61), as amended (AICPA,

	Professional


	Standards

	, Vol. 1 AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee also
	received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 and the Audit Committee discussed the independence of KPMG LLP with that firm.


	Based on the Audit Committees review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the
	Board of Directors approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Companys Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.


	The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have recommended the selection of KPMG LLP as the Companys independent registered
	public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2017.

	HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS



	We have made available a procedure approved by the SEC known as householding. This procedure allows multiple stockholders residing
	at the same address the convenience of receiving a single copy of our Notice, Annual Report on

	Form 10-K

	and proxy materials, as applicable. This allows us to save money by reducing the number of
	documents we must print and mail, and helps protect the environment as well.


	Householding is available to both registered stockholders
	(i.e., those stockholders with certificates registered in their name) and streetname holders (i.e., those stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage).



	Registered Stockholders



	If you are a
	registered stockholder and would like to consent to a mailing of proxy materials and other stockholder information only to one account in your household, as identified by you, we will deliver or mail a single copy of our Annual Report and proxy
	materials for all registered stockholders residing at the same address. Your consent will be perpetual unless you revoke it, which you may do at any time by contacting the Householding Department of American Stock Transfer & Trust
	Company, LLC (AST), at One Embarcadero Center, Suite 530, San Francisco, CA 94111.


	Registered stockholders who have
	not consented to householding will continue to receive copies of Annual Reports and proxy materials for each registered stockholder residing at the same address. As a registered stockholder, you may elect to participate in householding and receive
	only a single copy of Annual Reports or proxy statements for all registered stockholders residing at the same address by contacting AST as outlined above.



	Street Name Holders



	Stockholders who
	hold their shares through a brokerage may elect to participate in householding or revoke their consent to participate in householding by contacting their respective brokers.








	OTHER MATTERS



	We are not aware of any matters that may come before the meeting other than those referred to in the Notice. If any other matter shall
	properly come before the Annual Meeting, however, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote all proxies in accordance with their best judgment.


	Accompanying this Proxy Statement is our Annual Report. Copies of our Annual Report are available free of charge on our website at
	www.globalbloodtx.com or you can request a copy free of charge by calling Investor Relations at

	(415) 946-1090

	or sending an

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates generally to text communications over a communications network such as the Internet. More particularly, the invention concerns concurrent viewing of video programming and of text communications between viewers of the video programming.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In recent years, communications networks such as the Internet have become popular for their ability to enable people to communicate a virtually limitless variety of information across great distances. More importantly, the development of the Internet has enabled persons even with relatively little technical training to find, send and receive information using a browsing device (e.g. a personal computer or a television set-top box (STB)) running a browser program (e.g. MICROSOFT® Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator). This, in turn, has led to meteoric growth in Internet use.
One Internet feature which has gained particular popularity provides for real-time text conversations between users. These conversations, referred to as “chat”, typically involve a number of individuals, each of whom is in communication with a chat server where messages from each participant are received for distribution to all other participants. Once received by the chat server, the messages are available to the browsing devices where they are presented to respective participants. The chat server thus establishes a virtual “chat room” where participants can carry on a text conversation over the Internet.
Due to the vast number of Internet users, and the similarly vast number of chat rooms, it has become common practice to define a topic for discussion in a given chat room. The topic may be defined by agreement of the participants, but more typically is established by the chat service provider upon creation of the chat room. The topic may be maintained by the chat service provider policing the chat room, and limiting participation to those who engage in discussion on the defined topic. Alternatively, the chat room may be controlled by the participants themselves. In either event, however, the chat room typically is a somewhat permanent fixture available to participants throughout the day.
In order to access the Internet, many users subscribe to Internet access services which provide a convenient standardized interface between users and the vast number of Internet sites. One such Internet access service is the WEBTV® Internet access network (WEBTV is a registered trademark of WebTV Networks, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.). The WEBTV Internet access network links a large number of browsing devices, referred to as client terminals, with at least one host server which directs the flow of information to and from the client terminals. The client terminals are connected to the host server via conventional modem pools, either by Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connections, telephone lines, or other data links. Using these connections, users are able to access informational sites established by Internet publishers, and are able to access “chat rooms” whereby they may participate in interactive text conversations online. The host server also may offer supplemental services, such as email, news reports, television program guides, and enhanced access to certain web pages for subscribers of the service.
Although chat rooms are accessible to most users of the Internet, it can sometimes be difficult to find a chat room directed to a particular topic, especially when that topic has a limited period of relevance. Chat rooms relating to television programs fall into this category. For example, a chat room relating to a particular television show is of greatest interest for a short period around the time the show is aired. Unfortunately, there may not be a permanent chat room dedicated to a particular show where viewers can congregate and, even where such a chat room exists, a viewer may have difficulty locating the particular chat room and thus may be discouraged from experiencing chat rooms.
In the past, some television broadcasters have attempted to make chat available to viewers by providing chat rooms related to particular programming. Others have attempted to incorporate selected excerpts from relevant chat rooms into the broadcast itself. However, until now, viewers have not been provided with a system and method whereby they are able to simultaneously view a video program and participate in a chat room related to the video program using the same display. Moreover, viewers have been unable to select a chat option while viewing a video program so that the viewers may chat during the video program.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
A method and a system are provided for linking chat rooms and television viewing. More particularly, a system is provided in which a video signal, such as a television program, is received and displayed to viewers. The system has a user-selectable chat option in which viewers can enter text messages that will be displayed to other viewers of the video signal who have also selected the chat option. In one embodiment, the video signal is displayed on a graphical user interface in the form of a template having a video region for display of the video signal and a chat region for display of the text messages.
In some embodiments, the system also provides a viewer the ability to select among a plurality of different television programs to display. The system then provides a plurality of separate chat rooms, each associated with a corresponding television program. Upon selection of the chat option when viewing a particular one of the television programs, a viewer is placed in a chat room corresponding to the displayed television program. Thereafter, text messages from viewers of the same program who have likewise selected the chat option are displayed to each other.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 FIGS. 1–14 and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable networked computing environment in which the invention may be implemented. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other networked computer devices, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network.
 FIG. 1 depicts a control unit or browsing device 10 in the form of a client system. As indicated, the client system includes an electronics unit 12, a television 14, and a remote control 16. Electronics unit 12 typically is referred to as a set-top box (STB), because of its usual placement on top of television 14. Set-top box 12, however, may be built into television 14, forming an integral unit. The client system uses television 14 as a display device for displaying both video data and a graphical user interface, and as a loudspeaker device for emitting audio data. The set-top box is coupled to the television by a communications link 18. The link is an RF (radio frequency), S-video, composite video, or other equivalent form of communications link.
The set-top box includes hardware and/or software for receiving and decoding a broadcast video signal 20, such as an NTSC, PAL, SECAM or other TV system video signal, and providing video data to the television via link 20. Set-top box 12 also includes a browser program, which may be implemented in hardware and/or software, to cause a graphical user interface 22 to be displayed on television 14. The browser program enables a user to access various WEBTV network services, browse the World Wide Web, send email, or otherwise access the Internet.
Client system 10 may include a standard modem or an ISDN modem, such that the communication link between set-top box 12 and the Internet can be either a telephone (POTS) connection 24 or an ISDN connection 26. Alternatively, client system 10 may include a DOCSIS modem for communicating via a cable system or an antenna for wireless communications such as via satellite. As a further alternative, client system 10 may receive data via one type of communication line and send data or requests for data over a different medium. The set-top box receives power through a power line 28.
Remote control 16 is operated by the user to control television viewing, and to control the client system while browsing the World Wide Web, sending email, or performing other Internet-related functions. Remote control 16 typically includes a keyboard to allow an operator to enter text data, such as for email, and may also include a pointing device, microphone or other input device. The set-top box receives commands from remote control 16 via an infrared (IR) communication link. Alternatively, the link between the remote control and the set-top box may be an RF communication link or any equivalent communication link (e.g., wires, etc.).
 FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating internal features of set-top box 12. In this illustration, operation of the client system is controlled by a processing unit, such as central processing unit (CPU) 30, which is coupled to an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) 32. The CPU executes software designed to implement various features of the present invention. ASIC 32 contains circuitry which may be used to implement these features. ASIC 32 is coupled to an audio digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 34 which provides audio output to television 14. In addition, ASIC 32 is coupled to a video encoder 36 which provides video output to television 14. An IR interface 38 detects IR signals transmitted by remote control 16 and, in response, provides corresponding electrical signals to ASIC 32. A standard telephone modem 40 or an ISDN modem 42 are coupled to ASIC 32 to provide for connection(s) to the Internet. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the set-top box also may include a cable television or radio frequency modem or other system for sending and/or receiving data (not shown).
A receiver 44 receives broadcast video signals, such as an NTSC video signal. The video signal may be received and decoded directly by the receiver or may be a feed from a separate box, such as a cable decoder or a satellite receiver (not shown). Typically, the receiver is able to tune into a selectable channel or control/monitor the tuning of an external device such as the satellite receiver. This capability allows the set-top box to know what video signal is being processed, which in turn enables various functional capabilities described hereinbelow.
The receiver is coupled to ASIC 32 to provide corresponding electrical signals to ASIC 32. This allows video data carried in broadcast video signal 20 to be presented to the viewer on television 14. More specifically, receiver 44 is configured to digitize the incoming video signal, which is stored in RAM 48, so that ASIC 32 and CPU 30 can process the video signal before displaying it on the television. This configuration enables the set-top box to generate shared screen viewing where the video signal only occupies a portion of the screen. The remaining screen area then can be used to display various user interface controls or data, as described in more detail below.
By virtue of the combined video and Internet browsing capabilities of the set-top box, it is possible to provide functional integration between television viewing and Internet browsing. For instance, one feature of set-top boxes, as described herein, is provision of an electronic programming guide for television viewing. The electronic programming guide is an electronic database on the client which is periodically updated by the host server. The database includes scheduling, rating and other information about the television shows available to the user. Among other things, the electronic programming guide also can include links to websites associated with various shows. Using information associated with the programming guide, users are, for instance, able to conveniently access websites that relate to television shows using on screen links.
Also coupled to ASIC 32 is memory, including random access memory (RAM) 48 and read-only memory (ROM) 46, which provides for storage of program code for implementing application software to be executed by the set-top box. Note that ROM 46 may be a programmable ROM (PROM), or any form of erasable PROM (EPROM), or flash memory. A mass storage device 50 optionally may be provided and coupled to ASIC 42. The mass storage device may be used to input software or data to the client terminal or to store downloaded software or data. Mass storage device 50 can be any suitable device for storing machine-executable instructions, such as a magnetic drive, optical drive, and the like.
 FIG. 3 depicts an alternate browsing device in the form of a conventional personal computer 11, including a central processing unit (CPU) 52, a memory 54, and a bus 56 that couples various components (including the memory) to the CPU. Bus 56 may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The memory includes read-only memory (ROM) 58 and random access memory (RAM) 60. A basic input/output system 62 (BIOS), containing basic routines which help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer (such as during start-up), is stored in ROM 58.
The personal computer further includes a hard disk drive 66 and an optical disk drive 70 for reading from or writing to a removable optical media such as a CD-ROM or other optical storage. Hard disk drive 66 and optical disk drive 70 are connected to bus 56 by a hard disk drive interface 72 and an optical drive interface 76, respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the personal computer.
A video capture card 68 is connected to bus 56. Video capture card 68 provides functionality similar to that of the receiver of the set-top box of FIG. 2. In particular, the video capture card receives a video signal and feeds a digitized output to memory 54 or video memory on a video adapter. The video capture card is typically able to receive either an RF video input or a direct video/audio input. In the case of RF input, the user is normally able to control the channel or tuning through a software interface.
Although the exemplary environment shown in FIG. 3 employs a hard disk and a removable optical disk, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data which is accessible by a computer (e.g. magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs), etc.) also may be used.
A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk, optical disk, ROM 58, or RAM 60, including an operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. A user may enter commands and information into personal computer 11 through input devices such as a keyboard 78 and/or a pointing device (mouse) 80. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices often are connected to central processing unit 52 through a serial port interface 82 which is coupled to the bus. However, the input devices may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB).
A monitor 84 or other type of display device is also connected to bus 56 via an interface, such as a video adapter 86. In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as speakers and printers. Finally, personal computer 11 includes a browser program, which may be implemented in hardware and/or software to cause a graphical user interface to be displayed on monitor 84. The user employs the graphical user interface to browse the World Wide Web, send email, and otherwise access the Internet. In a typical graphical user interface, the user is also able to dedicate a portion of the screen to display of video content such as acquired through the video capture card. The personal computer also typically includes a modem 88, such as an ISDN modem or telephone line modem, connected to the serial bus for communication with remote computers through a communications network.
 FIG. 4 illustrates a basic configuration of a network computing environment in which a browsing device, such as a client terminal or personal computer, typically operates. A number of browsing devices 10 are coupled to a modem pool 90 via bi-directional data connections 92, which may be a telephone connection, ISDN connection, or any other similar type of connection, such as cable and satellite forward channels. Modem pool 90 typically is coupled through a router, such as that conventionally known in the art, to a server arrangement including a number of remote servers 94 via a conventional communications network 96, such as the Internet. Connected to the communications network is a host server 98, which specifically supports and communicates with browsing devices 10 and forms part of the server arrangement. The browsing devices each have a connection to host server 98 through modem pool 90 and the Internet. Note that modem pool 90 is a conventional modem pool, such as is found today throughout the world providing access to the Internet and private networks. A chat server 99 is accessible via the Internet to handle chat room operation as described below.
The present invention preferably is implemented on a communications network navigable by hypertext links, such as the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web encompasses a vast collection of web pages residing as data files on remote servers connected to the Internet. Each web page is downloadable and viewable by a browsing device, and often contains hypertext links, which, if selected, cause the browsing device to point to, or download and display, a new web page.
Within the World Wide Web, a collection of related web pages forms a website. Individuals or organizations that provide content to the World Wide Web are known as publishers. A single publisher on the Internet may establish a single page, an entire website, or multiple websites. Web pages are stored as data files on remote servers, and transmitted to browsing devices upon request from each browsing device. Each remote server has a unique identifier such as an Internet protocol (IP) address which marks its location on the Internet. Most have an alphanumeric domain name, associated with the IP address, providing an alternative, easy-to-remember address at which the remote server may be contacted. Each data file which contains web page data has a unique file path to indicate its location within the remote server.
To download and present data from a remote server over the communications network, browsing device 10 contacts one of remote servers 94 through communications network 96 using a network address such as a universal resource locator (URL). The URL, it will be appreciated, specifies the protocol by which the data is to be transferred, as well as the unique identifier (e.g. domain name or IP address) at which the remote server is located, and the file path of the specific file to be transferred. The remote server then transmits the requested data to the browser program, which in turn displays the data according to predefined conventions.
Data files containing web pages typically are transmitted using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and encoded using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). The HTML language provides a standard for interpretation of text data, formatting instructions, and other behavioral attributes of a web page, including links to other web pages or resource files containing image, video, and audio data.
 FIG. 5 illustrates a user interface 100 having a television program displayed thereon, as indicated by the large letters TV. A chat icon 104 appearing generally like a cartoon dialog bubble is selectively superimposed over the television program to provide the user with a chat option relating to the video program presented on the display. When the chat icon is displayed, a user can select or activate a link represented by the icon by pressing a particular button on the remote control such as “GO” or “RETURN”.
Upon activation of the link, the user is transferred into a chat room related to the particular television show being viewed as depicted in FIG. 6. In the chat room of FIG. 6, text messages from the new user (as well as other participants in the chat room) are displayed in a chat region 108 of a chat user interface 110, as symbolized by the large “Chat Transcript” identifier. Text messages between the various participants are transmitted to each other over a communications network, which is typically the Internet. As indicated, the chat user interface may include a text entry box 112 into which users are able to enter text messages using the remote control. After entry of the message, the user typically selects and actuates a send button 114 with the remote control to deliver a new message to add to the chat transcript. A scroll bar 116 on the edge of the chat user interface may be provided to allow the user to scroll up and down to review older messages that may have scrolled out of the chat region.
Chat user interface 110 also includes a video region 118 for display of a video signal, i.e., a television program which the user was viewing prior to entry of the chat room. The chat interface may further include a logo region 120 for display of a selected logo which may be associated with the chat room. An informational region 122 also may be provided, the information region including various data such as a clock 124, a television program identifier 126, i.e., a show name, a program schedule time 128 and an interactive link 130. Interactive link 130 may be provided to permit a user to jump to a website related to the television content being viewed, or receive other interactive data related to the television program. For instance, a user may be linked to the NBC website during viewing of an NBC show or may receive sports scores during a sporting event.
The area of the screen beneath the video and information regions may include a background image 132 used to also display some identifying characteristic of the television program. In FIG. 6 the background image is the logo for the network supplying the show, i.e., the NBC peacock logo. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 7, the background region may be used to display the logo associated with the show, i.e., Third Rock From the Sun. Some other possible identifying characteristics are a logo for the local network affiliate which broadcasts the television show or the title of a particular episode of the show.
An alternative user interface arrangement for a chat interface is illustrated in FIG. 8. In the interface of FIG. 8, chat region 108 is smaller and is positioned at the top of the interface, with video region 118 being located at the bottom. As indicated, text entry box 112 and send button 114 may be positioned between the video and chat regions. A status line 134 may be provided at the top of the interface to report the number of participants in the chat room. Additionally, a network logo (e.g., the Comedy Central logo) associated with the current television show may be displayed in logo region 120. An informational region 122 also may be provided, the depicted informational region including a clock 124 and a television program identifier 126. Additionally, a user selection area 136 may be provided such that the user is able to select between an Online Store option 138 and a TV Schedule option 140, allowing a user to access a website where they could purchase show-related goods online or access scheduling information related to the current show or its network. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 9, the logo or informational regions may contain the logo of the network service provider such as WEBTV and/or may contain advertisements.
 FIG. 10 illustrates another embodiment of a chat user interface arrangement. In particular, video region 118 in FIG. 10 is larger than the video region shown in FIG. 6 or FIG. 8. Chat region 108 is smaller and is disposed below the video region. As indicated, the informational region may be positioned at the left side and may include a clock 124 and a television program identifier 126. A logo region 120 may be positioned in the upper left hand corner and can display the network service provider logo, as shown, or may display a television network, a local affiliate or a show logo as previously described.
 FIG. 11 depicts another chat user interface embodiment which utilizes a full screen video region 118. As indicated, chat region 108, together with text entry box 112 and send button 114, may occupy the entire screen and are superimposed over the television program. This has the advantage of providing the maximum space for both video and chat regions, but legibility of the text messages may be reduced with some video content.
 FIGS. 12 and 13 depict two alternative paths for a user to enter a chat room related to a television program. FIG. 12 depicts a program information interface in which information such as a show time and episode description is presented for a particular television show. An interactive link 150 allows a user to automatically connect to a related website upon activation as described previously for link 130. A similar chat link 152 may be provided which transfers the user into the associated chat room upon selection as with chat icon 104. Video region 118 displays the selected television show if it is currently playing. Otherwise, the video region will display the currently playing show on the selected channel. The interface also typically provides user selectable buttons 154, 156 and 158 to allow a user to control recording of the show by an attached VCR (not shown), to set a reminder to appear prior to the start of the show and to exit the program information interface, respectively.
 FIG. 13 depicts an options screen that can be actuated using the remote control while viewing a television program. As indicated, the options screen may include an interactive link 150, a chat link 152, and user selectable buttons 160, 162 and 164, which allow a user to access a programming guide for a current day, access the previously-described program information interface and access a television favorites mode where still images from multiple channels are displayed simultaneously on separate small areas of the screen. The options screen also may include a user selectable button 166 which links the user to a chat room related to the current program upon selection. Button 166 is shown in the highlighted condition in FIG. 13.
It should be understood that, in the described embodiment, the presence of a chat room for a particular show is optional. For instance, the network service provider ultimately controls whether or not a chat link is presented to the user by controlling the display of the set-top box. Thus, a chat room may be provided only for certain shows. A broadcast network may contract with the network service provider to have a chat room for all of the shows broadcast by that network. Alternatively, shows may be individually selected to have an associated chat room based on user interest or other considerations.
Whether or not a chat link shows up for a particular television show typically is controlled by data in the electronic programming guide. In the electronic programming guide, each show has a unique identifier. Thus, a chat link may be created by simply changing a corresponding field in the electronic programming guide entry for the particular show. That field may then be monitored by the set-top box to determine whether or not to display a chat link when that show is active. Of course, the appearance of the chat link could be controlled many other ways, such as by information broadcast with the show. Such information could be a specific control signal, or monitoring the closed captioning text for a particular keyword, for instance.
Referring to FIG. 14, operation of an exemplary entertainment system is demonstrated, the depicted system including a chat client, a host server and a chat server. As indicated, when a user selects a chat option for a show X, a chat request typically is sent to the host server, which responds by sending an HTML formatted web page to the chat client for use in dynamically creating the desired user interface. Alternatively, the HTML formatted web page may be stored in memory at the chat client, or elsewhere for ready retrieval by the chat client. The HTML formatted web page thus may be employed as a user interface template for use in quickly creating a desired user interface.
It will be appreciated that various alternative templates may be used to create alternative user interfaces as described above. Furthermore, the template employed may be selected based on an identifying characteristic of the broadcast video signal. Upon identifying such a characteristic, for example, a template may be selected which defines a video region for display of the broadcast video signal, a chat region for display of text communications, and a logo region for display of a logo which reflects the identifying characteristic of the broadcast video signal. It thus will be appreciated that the interface may be customized based on the particular show, episode, network, network affiliate or other consideration.
The network, affiliate and program name, which are typically used to control the branding or logo selection for the user interface, generally are stored in the electronic programming guide in the entry for the particular show. The server may use the show, episode, network or affiliate information to select a particular template. The template then may be used to provide for presentation of a predefined user interface file for the particular show, episode, network or affiliate being viewed. If there is more than one interface that might apply to a particular show (e.g. an interface for the network and an interface for the show are available), the most specific interface (e.g. the interface for the show) is typically chosen.
Referring still to FIG. 14, it will be noted that the server response also includes instructions to the set-top box identifying the chat server. This allows for communication between the chat client and the desired chat room. It should be understood that the chat server functionality could be integrated into the host server system or could reside on any number of separate server systems.
The set-top box automatically connects to the chat server into a chat room identified using the show identifier for show X. The chat room may, in fact, be created upon request of a chat client to chat about a particular show. This tends to reduce the number of chat rooms which must be serviced by the chat server at any given time. If there is no interest in chatting about a particular show, the server will not create a chat room for that show.
Using the show identifier in the chat room designation allows simple and automatic linking of the various viewers of the show. Also, because the show identifier is unique, it is unlikely that two shows will have the same chat room designation. Users in the chat room are typically identified by their user ID, although any other suitable identifier could be used.
The chat server runs a standard chat server software such as ired. The server software maintains a table of the various participants in the chat room and echoes all messages from any of the participants to all of the participants. The set-top box runs corresponding client software which forwards messages entered in the text entry box to the chat server and displays the messages forwarded from the server. In the case of a personal computer based client, the user might have custom software to link to the chat room corresponding to a video program being viewed. Alternatively, a personal computer user could link to the chat by running a standard chat client program such mIRC and entering the appropriate chat server identification and chat room identification. If the personal computer user does not have access to electronic programming guide data as described above, the PC user could be provided with the necessary information via a website related to the current show, via data embedded in the broadcast signal of the show, or by requesting the information from the host server.
Normally, participants in the chat room for a particular show will leave within a short period following the end of the show. However, if participants do not exit the chat room spontaneously, they may receive a “Shows Over” reminder in place of the show time to encourage closure of the chat room. After a predetermined duration of time, the chat server may unilaterally close the chat room. This is helpful in ensuring that the chat server is able to adequately serve chat rooms for all shows currently being broadcast. Urging users to exit the chat room may also help to avoid chat between chat clients viewing the show in different time zones.
It is also possible, however, that the chat room could simply be maintained until such time as the last participant has left the chat room. Moreover, interactive link 130 may be changed to be a link to the chat room for the next show playing on that network. Thus, a user would be encouraged to continue viewing and chatting about the particular network's shows. It should be noted that the video region will be displaying the current show on the network, so that the new chat link would take the user to the chat room for the show playing after the end of the show associated with the current chat room.
As indicated above, one challenge presented by chat rooms linked to a particular show is that the show may play at different times in different time zones. Thus, depending on the length of the show, the show may or may not have ended by the time it starts in the next time zone. Thus, it may be desirable to create time zone specific chat rooms to eliminate the possibility of intersecting usage by participants in different time zones. The various changes that may occur at the end of a show are implemented by the set-top box which, using the show data in the electronic programming guide, can determine when a particular show has ended by comparing the show time to an internal clock. Fortunately, the internal clock is specific to the particular time zone and thus correctly tracks show play times in the current zone.
