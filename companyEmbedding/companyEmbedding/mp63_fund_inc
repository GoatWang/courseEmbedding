We

                the companies in
                the Index* (and
                fund). If a company
                were to no longer
                fulfill its role
                in our portfolio,
                we would replace
                it. We are happy
                to say that, after
                careful scrutiny,
                we believe that
                both our method
                of investing and
                our stock selections
                are on course to
                produce the results
                we desire
Many
                of you have been
                taking advantage
                of the automatic
                investing option
                to increase your
                holdings, as well
                as the increased
                limits on retirement
                account contributions.
                These are important
                parts of the steady
                inflow of new cash
                that fuels asset
                growth. 
Thanks
                to our disciplined
                shareholders, we've
                never had to sell
                stock to meet redemption
                requests, a problem
                that plagued some
                more conventional
                funds during the
                recent bear market.
                Such shareholder
                conduct has allowed
                us to take advantage
                of market declines
                to buy more shares.
We
                want to thank you
                for your comments
                and questions. As
                managers, we will
                continue to be accessible
                and responsive and
                we encourage you
                to join us in a
                regular program
                of investing in
                the fund over the
                long term.

                A dollar-cost averaging

                of such securities.

                You should consider

                your financial ability

                to continue purchases

                through periods

                of high and low

                a dollar-cost averaging

                strategy because

                the investments

                it makes are controlled

                by the investment

Please 
                read the MP 63 Fund prospectus carefully before you invest or

The
                opinions reflected
                above are subject
                to change are not
                investment advice
                and any forecasts
                made cannot be guaranteed.
                Past performance
                does not guarantee
                future results.
                The investment return
                and principal value
                of an investment
                will fluctuate so
                that an investor's
                shares, when redeemed,
                may be worth more
                or less than their
                original cost.
Dollar-cost
                averaging does not
                assure a profit
                and does not protect
                against a loss in
                declining markets.
                A dollar-cost averaging
                strategy involves
                continuous investment
                in securities regardless
                of fluctuations
                in price levels
                of such securities.
                You should consider
                your financial ability
                to continue purchases
                through periods
                of high and low
                price levels. The
                MP 63 Fund does
                not strictly follow
                a dollar-cost averaging
                strategy because
                the investments
                it makes are controlled
                by the investment
                amounts it receives
                from its shareholders.
Please
                read the MP 63 Fund
                prospectus carefully
                before you invest
                or send money. If
                you have any questions,

                The investment return

                and principal value

                of an investment

                will fluctuate so

                that an investor's

                shares, when redeemed,

                may be worth more

                or less than their

                original cost.
Dollar-cost

                averaging does not

                assure a profit

                and does not protect

                against a loss in

                declining markets.

                A dollar-cost averaging

                strategy involves

                continuous investment

                in securities regardless

                of fluctuations

                in price levels

                of such securities.

                You should consider

                your financial ability

                to continue purchases

                through periods

                of high and low

                price levels. The

                MP 63 Fund does

                not strictly follow

                a dollar-cost averaging

                strategy because

                the investments

                it makes are controlled

                by the investment

                amounts it receives

                from its shareholders.
Please

                read the MP 63 Fund

                prospectus carefully

                before you invest

THE MP 63 FUND



Semi-Annual Report
August 31, 2003
(Unaudited)












8869 Brecksville Rd., Suite C Brecksville, Ohio 44141-1921
1-877-MP63FUND (1-877-676-3386)


Dear Fellow Shareholders,

August 31 marked the mid-point of our fifth fiscal year, and in the midst of a remarkable rally on Wall Street.  The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the MP 63 Fund stood at $9.81 on August 31, up 21.26% from the February 28 fiscal year-end, which closed with an NAV of $8.09.  This compared favorably with the 19.32% gain by the Dow Jones Industrials, the 19.84% rise by the S&P 500, and the gain of 35.36% by the NASDAQ Composite during the same period. 1 

By accumulating shares on a regular basis, weve tried to employ a method similar to a dollar-cost averaging 2 philosophy, and that appears to be proving itself over time.  Since passing the 3-year mark, weve maintained a five-star rating 3 from Morningstar.  We think our results will continue to be superior, thanks to our industry-leading companies, regular accumulation, and low turnover.  So far this year, the few replacements weve made have been due to mergers (Clayton Homes, Household International) and the imposition of high-fee DRIPs (Altria Group, Harley Davidson).  The companies that weve added (Colgate-Palmolive, Countrywide Financial, Kimberly-Clark, and Polaris Industries) feature safety and growth, as well as excellent potential for dividend increases.

The other major change for our fund was the move to a new administrator, Mutual Shareholder Services.  We believe that MSS is already helping us to limit costs and maximize shareholder value, as evidenced by our operating income of $93,092 for the past six months, compared with $58,288 a year earlier and $142,825 for the entire fiscal year that ended February 28, 2003.  Were hoping that shareholders will also join us in agreeing to receive annual and semi-annual reports in electronic form, which will save even more in printing and mailing costs.  Please see the enclosed form for that authorization.  Meanwhile, we hope youll join us in continuing to invest in the MP 63 Fund on a regular basis.

Sincerely,

/s/Vita Nelson
/s/ David S. Fish
Vita Nelson and David Fish, Co-Managers

Notes to Financial Statements
August 31, 2003 
(Unaudited)



1.)
ORGANIZATION
     The MP63 Fund (the "Fund") is organized as a Maryland Corporation, incorporated on October 13, 1998, and registered as an open-end, diversified, management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  The Fund's business and affairs are managed by its officers under the direction of its Board of Directors.  The Fund's investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation for shareholders.

2.)
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund.  These policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
A.  Security Valuation - Securities are valued at market value following procedures approved by the Board of Directors. 
B.  Security Transactions and Related Investment Income - Securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.  Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.
C.  Federal Income Taxes - The Fund complies with requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies, distributing all of its taxable income to its shareholders.  Therefore, no provision for Federal income tax is required.
D. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders - The Fund records dividends and distributions to shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The Fund will distribute its net investment income, if any, and net realized capital gains, if any, annually.
E.  Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3.)
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement (the "Agreement") with The Moneypaper Advisor, Inc. (the "Advisor").  Under this Agreement, the Advisor provides the Fund with investment advice and supervises the Fund's management and investment programs.  As compensation for the services rendered, the Fund pays the Advisor a fee accrued daily based on an annual rate of .35%.  For the six months ended August 31, 2003, the Advisor earned fees of $36,394.
     The Advisor has voluntarily agreed to defer its advisory fee and to reimburse the Fund for other expenses so that total operating expenses of the Fund do not exceed an annual rate of 1.25% of average daily net assets.  Under the terms of the Agreement, fees deferred or expenses reimbursed by the Advisor are subject to reimbursement by the Fund, if so requested by the Advisor, up to five years from the fiscal year the fee or expense was incurred. However, no reimbursement payment will be made by the Fund if it would result in the Fund exceeding the voluntary expense limitation described above.  As of August 31, 2003, there are $124,009 of fees subject to recapture by the Advisor.
     The Fund has an administrative agreement with Mutual Shareholder Services. (The "Administrator"). Under this agreement, the Administrator provides the Fund with administrative, transfer agency, and fund accounting services.  Mutual Shareholder Services charges an annual fee of approximate $50,000 for services rendered based on the Funds current asset size.  The Fund is responsible for the cost of printing, postage, telephone costs and certain other out-of-pocket expenses. Vita Nelson is an officer and director of the Advisor and also an officer and director of the Fund.

The MP63 Index is equally weighted among
                companies, regardless of size, and basically
                follows the fate of $100 investments in each
                company, with dividends reinvested, individually
                and in the aggregate. So each company has its own
                "index",
                regardless of price
                level or stock split
                history, and the
                overall index is
                the aggregate performance
                of all stocks. When
                an individual company
                has a reading of
                200, it has doubled
                the value of its
                initial investment,
 
                 which was made
                at the start of
                1994, turning $100
 
                 into $200. When
                the MP63 passed
                the 200 level, as
 
                 it did on June
                6, 1997, it meant
                that an initial
                investment of $6,300
                ($100 in each company)
                had achieved a value
                of over $12,600.

                The investment return
                and principal value
                of an investment
                will fluctuate so
                that an investor's
                shares, when redeemed,
                may be worth more
                or less than their
                original cost.
Dollar-cost
                averaging does not
                assure a profit
                and does not protect
                against a loss in
                declining markets.
                A dollar-cost averaging
                strategy involves
                continuous investment
                in securities regardless
                of fluctuations
                in price levels
                of such securities.
                You should consider
                your financial ability
                to continue purchases
                through periods
                of high and low
                price levels. The
                MP 63 Fund does
                not strictly follow
                a dollar-cost averaging
                strategy because
                the investments
                it makes are controlled
                by the investment
                amounts it receives
                from its shareholders.
Please
                read the MP 63 Fund
                prospectus carefully
                before you invest
