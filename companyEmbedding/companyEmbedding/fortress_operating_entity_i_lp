faith” or under another express standard, the General Partner

its Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to enforce
the terms of this Agreement, shall keep and retain in the strictest
confidence and not to disclose to any Person all confidential
matters of the Partnership or any Person included within Fortress

anything to the contrary herein, each Partner (and each employee,
representative or other agent of such Partner) may disclose to any
and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment
and tax structure of (x) the Partnership and (y) any of its
transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or
other tax analyses) that are provided to the Partners relating to
such tax treatment and tax structure.

 

(b)

threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of Section
2.12(a), the General Partner shall have the right and remedy to
have the provisions of such Section specifically enforced by
injunctive relief or otherwise by any court of competent
jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other security,
it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened
breach shall cause irreparable injury to the Partnership, the other
Partners, Fortress or any of its Subsidiaries, and the accounts and
funds managed by Fortress and that money damages alone shall not
provide an adequate remedy to such Persons.  Such rights and

may be incurred by any such Person in connection with the
activities of the Partnership and/or its Subsidiaries regardless of

of this Agreement.  The Partnership may enter into indemnity
contracts with Covered Persons and such other Persons as the
General Partner shall determine and adopt written procedures

ARTICLE III
 
INTERESTS AND ADMISSION OF PARTNERS
 

Section 3.1                                      
Units .

 

(a)                                  
Interests in the Partnership shall
be represented by Units.  Initially, all Units shall be
designated as “Class A Common Units” (“ Class
A Common Units ”) and “Class B Common Units”
(“ Class B Common Units ”), and, except as
expressly provided herein, a Class A Common Unit and a Class B
Common Unit shall entitle the holder thereof to equal rights under
this Agreement.  From time to time, the General Partner may
establish other classes or series of Units pursuant to Section
3.2.  Units may (but need not, in the sole discretion of the
General Partner) be evidenced by a certificate (a “
Certificate of Ownership ”) in the form set forth in
Exhibit A (for Class A Common Units or Class B Common Units)
or the Unit Designation relating to such Units (for other
Units).  The Certificate of Ownership may contain such legends
as may be required by law or as may be appropriate to evidence, if
approved by the General Partner pursuant to Section 8.1, the pledge
of a Partner’s Units.  Each Certificate of Ownership
shall be signed by or on behalf of the General Partner by either
manual or facsimile signature.  The Certificates of Ownership
of the Partnership shall be numbered and registered in the register
or transfer books of the Partnership as they are issued.  The
Partnership shall act as registrar and transfer agent for the
purposes of registering the ownership and Transfer of Units. 
If a Certificate of Ownership is defaced, lost or destroyed it may
be replaced on such terms, if any, as to evidence and indemnity as
the General Partner thinks fit.

 

(b)                                 
Transfer and Exchange
.  When Certificates of
Ownership are presented to the Partnership with a request to
register a Transfer, the Partnership shall register the Transfer or
make the exchange on the register or transfer books of the
Partnership if the requirements set forth in Section 8.1 of this
Agreement for such transactions are met; provided, however ,
that any Certificates of Ownership presented or surrendered for
registration of Transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument of Transfer in form
satisfactory to the Partnership duly executed by the holder thereof
or his attorney duly authorized in writing.  The Partnership
shall not be required to register the Transfer, or exchange, any
Certificate of Ownership if as a result the Transfer of the Units
at issue would cause the Partnership to violate the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act (including by causing
any violation of the laws, rules, regulations, orders and other
directives of any governmental authority) or otherwise violate
Section 8.1 of this Agreement.

 

(c)                                  
Record Holder
.  Except to the extent that
the Partnership shall have received written notice of a Transfer of
Units and such Transfer complies with the requirements of Section
8.1 of this Agreement applicable to such transaction, the
Partnership shall be entitled to treat the individual or entity in
whose name any Certificates of Ownership issued by the Partnership
stand on the books of the Partnership as the absolute owner
thereof, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to, or interest in, such Units on the part of any other
individual or entity.
 
15 





 

(d)                                 
Class B Common Unit Voting
Rights .  Holders of
Class B Common Units shall have no voting, consent or approval
rights with respect to any matter submitted to holders of Units for
their consent or approval, except as set forth in Sections 4.1(c)
and 10.1(a).

 

(e)                                  
Automatic Conversion of Class B
Common Units .  If,
as a result of an exchange pursuant to the Exchange Agreement,
Fortress or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any Fortress
Operating Group Entity and any Subsidiary of a Fortress Operating
Group Entity) acquires any Class B Common Units, such Units will
automatically convert into an equal number of Class A Common
Units.

 

Section 3.2                                      
Issuance of Additional
Units .  The General
Partner may from time to time admit any Person as an additional
Limited Partner of the Partnership (each such Person, if so
admitted, an “ Additional Limited Partner ” and
collectively, the “ Additional Limited Partners
”).  A Person shall be deemed admitted as a Limited
Partner at the time such Person (i) executes this Agreement or a
counterpart of this Agreement and (ii) is named as a Limited
Partner on the attached Schedule A .  Each Substitute
Limited Partner shall be deemed an Additional Partner whose
admission as an Additional Limited Partner has been approved by the
General Partner for all purposes hereunder.  Subject to the
satisfaction of the foregoing requirements and Section 4.1(c), the
General Partner is hereby expressly authorized to cause the
Partnership to issue additional Units for such consideration and on
such terms and conditions, and to such Persons, including the
General Partner, any Limited Partner or any of their Affiliates, as
shall be established by the General Partner in its sole discretion,
all without the approval of any Partner or any other Person. 
Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to Section 4.1(c), the
General Partner is expressly authorized to cause the Partnership to
issue Units (i) upon the conversion, redemption or exchange of any
debt, Units or other securities issued by the Partnership, (ii) for
less than fair market value, so long as the General Partner
concludes in good faith that such issuance is in the best interests
of the Partnership and its Partners, and (iii) in connection with
the merger of any other Person into the Partnership if the
applicable merger agreement provides that Persons are to receive
Units in exchange for their interests in the Person merging into
the Partnership.  The General Partner is hereby expressly
authorized to take any action, including without limitation
amending this Agreement and Schedule A , to reflect any
issuance of additional Units.  Additional Units may be Class A
Common Units, Class B Common Units or other Units.  Any
additional Units may be issued in one or more classes, or one or
more series of any of such classes, with such designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, powers and duties (including, without limitat
