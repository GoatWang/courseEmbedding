About Wealthminder



Wealthminder was created for one simple reason:
To help people get the financial assistance they need to achieve their long-term financial goals.


Wealthminder is a database of every Investment Advisor Representative in the country.
We work hard to collect and provide you the information you need to find a financial advisor who’s right for you.


If you are looking for a specific financial advisor and you can’t find them on Wealthminder,
it’s likely that they are either exclusively a broker or are unlicensed - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Financial Advisor through Wealthminder



Historically finding and hiring a financial advisor was hard.
Wealthminder was built to make the process much easier.


The best way to use Wealthminder is to take advantage of our free proposal system.
All you have to do is take a few minutes of your time to describe your situation and the assistance you are looking for.


Wealthminder then sends your request to our network of
prescreened financial advisors.
If a financial advisor is interested in your business, they will submit a proposal to you.


You review the proposals you receive and decide if you’d like to have a follow-up call with one or more of the financial advisors.


Throughout the process, you maintain control. We only share your contact information with a financial advisor once you ask for an introduction.

1The notation “Not an SEC Registered Municipal Advisor” indicates that the municipal advisor firm’s MSRB Form A-12 does not reflect current registration with the SEC and the municipal advisor was not listed by the SEC on its most recent list of registered municipal advisors, published here.
2The Series 50 is designed to test broad-based knowledge of the business and regulations governing municipal advisory activities. The examination is not designed to specifically test each specialized functional role or service that may be provided on behalf of a municipal advisor firm as defined in Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act and, therefore, does not confer the degree of knowledge and expertise needed to provide a municipal entity or obligated person client with informed advice as required under MSRB Rule G-42.  
3A municipal advisor firm is obligated to maintain a current and accurate SEC Form MA-I for each associated person.

Did you know there is a Taxpayer Bill of Rights?Taxpayer Bill of Rights.pdf Adobe Acrobat document [13.0 KB]             

 


 Why You Need A Financial Advisor  If you are a borrower eligible to take advantage of lower costing tax-exempt debt, did you know there are now laws that may affect the depth
of the advice your broker dealer/investment banker may give to you?
 
In the past, many borrowers have depended on ideas, suggestions and related "advice services" from public finance bankers outside of an
underwriting engagement. New rules (effective July 1, 2014) limit the ability of investment bankers to provide such assistance outside an underwriting engagement - and it may even limit some of the
advice they can give you even while engaged.
 
You should further note that the law requires an engaged underwriter to disclose to a municipal borrower that they may have interests adverse
to their own. This conflict of interest was the basis for why in year 2000, Jon Roberts formed Roberts Consulting, LLC. It took a 2008 world economic financial meltdown for the lawmakers to review
and acknowledge this conflict, and then it took nearly 6 years more to implement rules in an attempt to address it.   
 
Please Remember This:
Roberts Consulting, LLC is a registered Municipal Advisor.
 
In July 2010 the Dodd-Frank Act included a provision that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) regulate non-dealer "municipal advisors"
(MA).
 
If you have someone soliciting you and providing ideas as to how to structure a tax-exempt bond issue for your particular needs and circumstances - then they are likely undertaking a municipal
advisory activity. If they are not registered with the SEC and MSRB as an MA, they may be violating the law.
 
If your broker dealer renders advice particular to your needs outside an underwriting engagement, provided the transaction you execute utilizes
that advice, it would preclude that investment bank from acting as your underwriter. However, provided they are registered as an MA they can continue to work as your advisor.
 
The SEC's general definition of "advice" under the MA rules is: "advice includes, without limitation a recommendation that is particularized to the specific needs, objectives, or circumstances
of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, including with respect to the structure, timing, terms and
other similar matters concerning such financial products or issues, based on all the facts and circumstances."
 
For the typical Roberts Consulting, LLC client (all of whom are not
 “municipal entities”) read the above SEC definition of "advice" using the following understandings:
 
"obligated persons"
means a borrower  responsible for the repayment of municipal security indebtedness (could be a 501(c)3, a
for-profit developer entity, an owner of a manufacturing facility, etc.); and
 
"municipal financial products"
means products or services such as the reinvestment of bond proceeds, the use of interest rate derivatives (swaps and
caps), plus other products that are often tied or linked to the needs of issuing/using municipal security indebtedness.
 
The SEC's rules provide broker dealers with three narrowly-defined exemptions where "advice" may be given
without being considered a Municipal Advisor:

If the broker dealer is contractually engaged to serve as the borrower's underwriter 
If the borrower already has an "independent registered municipal advisor" and
If the broker dealer is responding to a request for proposal (RFP) 

The law does not provide a way for a borrower to agree with an underwriter to "opt out" from the applicability of these rules.
 
How do you know if you want to hire a broker dealer without knowing if they intend to (or even can) offer the financing solution best suited to
your needs? The devil is in the details - and they are not (without engagement) allowed to provide those details.
 
If you opt for the RFP exception, how do you know all the right questions or providers to ask if you don't fully understand the array of
products and services that might be available to you? The markets are forever changing, and the products and services keep developing to address those changes.
 
The problem is that what you don't know - and what you may not ask - can result in a higher costing and/or less than an optimally structured
financing. Today you are subject to increasingly more complicated products and structural choices. Meanwhile new regulations are serving to stymie traditional resources to learning which product or
service could or would be of particular interest to you. The result is that the use of a financial advisor (registered Municipal Advisor) is even more essential than it has ever been.
 
You should ask your advisor if they are a registered MA. Roberts Consulting is not a registered MA by choice. The law made us register. We are
-  long before the laws existed - a financial advisor because we know borrowers (of tax-exempt finance) need a fair, impartial voice they can trust. A voice that comes in the absence of material
conflicts of interest. A voice of experience, and one possessing the expertise they will learn to know they can rely on.

refinancing project. Our process was very well coordinated and managed and you contributed greatly to the outstanding results"   Steven Raichilson, 
Executive Director, Menorah Park Center for Senior Living  


 "Jon advised me in 2004 while working on my first 4% LIHTC deal. His expert opinion has proved
useful as I examine which deals to drop and which to close. He has great insight on his ability to model a transaction and his negotiating skills are sharp. I highly recommend Jon"               Chris

Financial Advisory


Our Approach
At PFM, our financial advisors play an active part in designing and executing the financing strategies of our clients. We see ourselves as both our clients' partner and guide in helping to achieve their specific goals.
We built our reputation by providing superior service to our clients and making their involvement in the day-to-day financing process as streamlined as possible. Perhaps this is why, since 1987, PFM’s financial advisory team has been ranked the nation's leading independent municipal financial advisors in terms of par amount and number of issues by Thomson-Reuters.






Ingenuity
Informed by deep insight into the marketplace, our solutions are never cookie-cutter. We believe that a financial advisor should be a resourceful partner, helping clients face whatever challenges may arise, with sound advice based on careful, relevant analysis.  We develop ideas that reflect the needs and perspective of our clients, allowing them to attend to their futures proactively instead of reactively.  
Diligent Management
When serving as financial advisor, we take an all-encompassing approach, ensuring that our clients’ best interests come first and foremost during each step of the capital formation process. We provide a forum for ideas, an environment for testing conventional wisdom, and a platform for forging value-added strategies. Most importantly, we help our clients execute transactions efficiently and seamlessly.
Fiduciary Focus
We believe advising our clients carries with it a sacred trust. Our 40+ year reputation is built upon putting our clients first. PFM incorporates our financial advisory professionals’ deep market expertise with sophisticated modeling capabilities, centralized bond pricing analysis and the collaborative power of teamwork to advise on each client’s unique objectives. Our goal is to reduce our clients’ financing costs and identify risks in ever-changing markets. 
Our Solutions
Transaction Management & Bond Pricing
Issuing debt requires careful analysis and expertly delivered advice at every turn. We help our clients access capital for their projects through multiple tools including municipal bonds, bank loans, state and federal loan programs, public-private partnerships and other options which may not require borrowing such as grants or pay-as-you-go sources. To each engagement, we bring an understanding of what others have done successfully and how those ideas or approaches may work within the context of a client’s specific circumstances. 
PFM professionals are among the most active participants in the municipal securities market. We were the first financial advisory practice to have dedicated individuals focused exclusively on developing tools that help our clients receive fair pricing for their bonds. Our pricing group practice possesses extensive experience in both competitive and negotiated sales, matched only by the largest underwriting firms.
Credit Strategies
Accessing the capital markets, or obtaining some form of lending, on predictable and acceptable terms depends on having an effective credit strategy. We help our clients develop and implement successful credit strategies that support their borrowing needs, while maintaining funding flexibility and sustainable finances.
Capital Planning
We design long term plans of finance to fund our clients’ ambitions. The crucial first step is to define the rules of the road — the financial planning that will get our clients where they need to go in the short and long term. A solid foundation of financial, debt and tax policies along with sound analytics is fundamental for creating a sustainable, long-range plan of finance. After that, we are with our clients every step of the way, as partners and advisors.
