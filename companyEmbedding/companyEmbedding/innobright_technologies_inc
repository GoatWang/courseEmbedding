Innobright Technologies Inc.
Render Smarter!






Company Overview
Animation/Commercial visual effects (VFX), Architectural visualization, Virtual reality/Gaming, Scientific visualization, Product design and Cloud Rendering firms of all sizes face a common challenge – Rendering Time. This problem is generally addressed with “brute force” CAPEX – adding more render servers + render software licenses to save time or by OPEX - renting more cloud rendering services.  Project costs still are high, since existing rendering technology takes a long time and devours anywhere from 20% to 30% of project budget. The denoising (or noise removal) alternative that “Altus” brings is more elegant, fits into the work flow and accelerates rendering throughput, resulting in a higher quality project outcome while saving time (2X to 12X faster) and money (30%-50% of rendering costs).

Quality 3D renders used to be expensive & time consuming.
NOT anymore!
Introducing  Altus – the world’s first multi-platform, high performance, Monte Carlo render denoising system What is Altus and its benefits?
Altus is a denoising software for physically-based, Monte Carlo renderers used in 3D pipelines. Altus takes feature and color information from existing rendering software systems and removes Monte Carlo noise in a very short time. The end result – user gets to render less, feed the noisy outputs to Altus and produce a high quality output. Altus CLI can be run as a post-processing plugin with existing render farm automation software such as Deadline, Muster or Royal Render. With Altus you can:
✔ Save time – Altus gives you the quality you want, in a fraction of the time – at least 70% for pre-renders and 40% for final renders. Altus lets you generate fast, noisy renders with smaller samples per pixel (SPP) and filters them to produce high quality images/animation.
✔ Reduce costs – at least 30% and in some cases 50%; costs include rendering personnel, computing for render nodes and IT/maintenance costs.
✔ Integrate easily – Altus seamlessly integrates into your render pipeline or workflow and accelerates Monte Carlo renders!

Significant Savings for Production!


Altus Innobright allowed us to generate light  image renders with noise, that when filtered have the same quality as heavy renders that take a longer time to process. When rendering complex images,  time has  improved by up to 30%, resulting in significant  production savings. Aronnax Animation Studios is very pleased with the benefits achieved during the production of the animated feature film “condorito".

“Altus saves on both OPEX and CAPEX!”


Altus is essential to our pipeline. Altus doesn’t just speed things up a bit, it removes the noise/speed compromise altogether. We would struggle to achieve the same quality in the 30 minute render that we get in the Altus filtered 12 minute render.

Discontinuing node-locked licenses



We’re simplifying our licensing options. As of May 4, we’ll only be offering direct sales of floating licenses. Floating licenses let you run Altus on any machine you’d like, provided you’re able to connect to your provisioned license server. We’ve removed the node-locked purchase options because many customers have purchased them only to realize it’s simply not versatile enough, creating support headaches for both you and us. If you have a specific use case where … Read More







Great News! Altus now costs 50% less!



That’s right! We’ve listened to your recent feedback and have cut our prices by as much as 50%. For both node-locked and floating, you’ll save 50% off our previous prices per month. For a semi-annual and annual licenses, you’ll get one month and three months free, respectively, just like before. Check out our new pricing at http://www.innobright.com/product/altus-purchase-options/. If you’re a current Altus customer, you should have received information about how we are adjusting your subscriptions … Read More







Innobright Noise Removal Software Review – Aleksey Voznesenski of ace5studios.com










Spanish review of Altus – Nov 2015!










Innobright Altus 1.3 now available



Altus 1.3 is ready! We’re later than we’d like, but unlike the leap day the next release of Altus will be well within 4 years. Altus is now quite a bit smarter in GPU mode. If you have a multi-GPU setup, Altus will automatically choose the card with the most memory. If a failure occurs while operating in GPU mode, Altus will automatically restart in CPU mode so your image will filter no matter what. … Read More







Innobright Altus 1.2 available



After staying up late New Years Eve fixing last-minute bugs, Altus 1.2 is now available! Are you held up on evaluating Altus because it was difficult to run? Callie has created a video walking through the setup for Altus for Windows. Watch it now. If you haven’t purchased Altus yet, evaluating Altus’ denoising performance may have been difficult because of the oppressive watermark. We’ve listened to you and made the watermark significantly less conspicuous for … Read More







Altus 1.1 available for download



Dear innobright user, We are excited to announce the availability of Altus 1.1 release for download.  Please visit innobright.com and click on the Downloads link to access the 1.1 release. Our enhanced website has pricing information and lets you purchase Altus! Please visit Products -> Altus Purchase Options page to purchase the watermark-free version of Altus. We also updated our Support -> Documentation page and we are constantly improving our FAQ page. We look forward … Read More

This problem is generally addressed with “brute force” CAPEX – adding more render servers + render software licenses to render faster or by OPEX - renting more cloud rendering services.  Project costs still remain high, since state-of-the-art rendering technology (Monte carlo methods based ray tracing) takes a long time to produce the high quality output that users desire. The denoising (or noise removal) alternative that “Altus” brings is elegant, fits into the work flow and accelerates rendering throughput, resulting in a higher quality project outcome while saving time and between >30% of render costs. 

Innobright’s Altus product represents the highest quality render denoising solution that is fast and easy for our customers to implement, affordably priced and generates an immediate, high value return on investment.

Altus value proposition includes: 
1)	Dramatically improves rendering throughput by 2x to 12x improvement in speed for a given quality
2)	Provides significant cost savings by avoiding added hardware/software CAPEX, third party “render farm” rentals and reducing personnel costs
3)	Works for all film/advertisement/architectural scenarios and provides perceivable image quality improvement
4)	Compatible with ANY Monte Carlo rendering system and runs on CPU and GPU servers 
5)	Seamlessly integrates into customer workflow, allowing ease of use and minimal learning

Market Opportunity:
In the world of CGI, the big budget projects and entertainment studios garner the most attention. However, the proliferation of VFX in Advertising, A&E, Gaming and VR has dramatically increased the number or seats or nodes in the rendering workflow. Worldwide, there are an estimated 2.5 to 3 million render nodes across all the industry segments combined (private render farms). In addition, there are about 1 million cloud rendering nodes (from cloud providers such as Google, Amazon etc).
