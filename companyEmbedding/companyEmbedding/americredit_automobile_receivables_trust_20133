For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2013-2 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2013-2
    





April 01, 2013 09:28 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 
      2013-2:
    

      --$214,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$382,800,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,800,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$84,170,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$104,490,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,750,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,290,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-2 is consistent 
      with 2013-1 and 2012 transactions. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac 
      Corp. (FICO) score is 566, and WA internal credit score is 240. Used 
      cars total 56.7% and WA loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 110%, all 
      consistent with recent pools.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with the last four transactions. The reserve is 2.00% 
      (non-declining) and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25% (both of 
      the initial pool balance), growing to a target of 14.25% of the current 
      pool balance, less the reserve.
    

      Stronger Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      portfolio and 2009 - 2012 AMCAR securitizations have declined to some of 
      the lowest levels ever seen, supported by the gradual economic recovery 
      and strong used vehicle values supporting higher recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook, and 
      GM Financial 'BB' with a Positive Watch. GM Financial recorded positive 
      corporate financial results since 2010, and the overall health of GM has 
      also improved.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and 
      securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI capable of adequately 
      servicing this series.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce CNL levels higher than the base 
      case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining loss 
      coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain 
      note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending 
      on the extent of the decline in coverage. Hence, Fitch conducts 
      sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base case CNL 
      assumption by 1.5x and 2.5x and examining the rating implications on all 
      classes of issued notes. The 1.5x and 2.5x increases of the base case 
      CNL represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively, and are 
      intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to 
      unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service 
      FitchResearch, which includes all presale reports, surveillance, and 
      credit reports on more than 20 asset classes, contact product sales at 
      +1-212-908-0800 or at 'webmaster@fitchratings.com'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

Key Rating Drivers Weaker Credit Quality: The 2013-3 pool has marginally weaker credit quality than  recent transactions, with a 562 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO)  score, a 239 WA internal credit score and 91.1% 60+ month loan terms (extended  term loans). The pool is consistent with 2013-2, including 48.9% new vehicles,  55% cars and a 109% WA LTV. Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a  sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is consistent  with the prior five transactions. The reserve is 2.00% (non-declining), and  initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25% growing to a target of 14.25% of the  outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount). Stronger Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on General Motors  Financial Company, Inc.'s portfolio and 2009 - 2012 AMCAR securitizations  declined to some of its lowest levels, supported by the gradual economic  recovery and strong used vehicle values supporting higher recovery rates. Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates General Motors Company (GM) 'BB+' with a  Stable Outlook, and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) 'BB';  Rating Watch Positive. GM Financial has recorded positive corporate financial  results since 2010, and the overall health of GM has also improved. Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AmeriCredit Financial Services  Inc. (AFSI) demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and  servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience  and securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing  this series. Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide  that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the timeliness of payments on  the securities. Rating Sensitivity Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on  defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and  could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the  sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of AmeriCredit Automobile  Receivables Trust 2013-3 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays some sensitivity to  increased defaults and losses, with some classes showing potential downgrades of  up to two rating categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss)  scenario. Some classes of notes could experience downgrades of more than three  rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.  Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the  accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at  'www.fitchratings.com'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
