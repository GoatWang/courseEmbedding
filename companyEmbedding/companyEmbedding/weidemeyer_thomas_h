Donor Stories
 
Thomas H. Weidemeyer ’69Gifts to Colgate Can Benefit Retirement and Create a Philanthropic Legacy
Weidemeyer, who retired as senior vice president and chief operating  officer of UPS, has made Colgate the beneficiary of a 15-year charitable  remainder trust.
“Giving through the trust was an opportunity to put some highly  appreciated assets to good use,” he said. “I avoided pretty dramatic tax  consequences [with capital gain] while providing Colgate with long-term  support. It also provides me with annual income.”
Colgate is an academic environment “second to none,” Weidemeyer said.  “It gave me the chance to be around others who were looking to be  successful in life. That liberal arts education stood me in good stead  for the next step in life”—earning a law degree and then working his way  up from an entry-level position to COO of UPS.
Weidemeyer originally did not designate how his gift should be used.  “The money being beneficial to Colgate was the most important thing to  me,” he said. “Colgate decided the best possible use was for the  financial aid initiative.”
Weidemeyer urges other alumni to consider how planned gifts can  benefit their retirement and create their philanthropic legacy at  Colgate.
“Think about how the foundation laid by your time at Colgate enabled  you to be successful,” he said. “Here’s the opportunity to provide  others with a similar chance.”
 
Back
The discussion herein is general in nature and may not apply to all individuals. Prospective donors are urged to consult their personal tax and financial advisors concerning the specific consequences of making gifts to Colgate. We would be pleased to discuss, in confidence, ways in which you may support Colgate. These measures may also have an impact on your estate planning.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
