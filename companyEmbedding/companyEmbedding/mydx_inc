MyDx – CannaDx Sensor & AnalyzerHome / MyDx – CannaDx Sensor & Analyzer





Portable Cannabis Potency and Chemical Analyzer
Find the Strain that Works for You
The CannaDx™ sensor will allow you to test your cannabis potency (% THC) on site and within a matter of minutes, but this proprietary sensor goes even beyond that. CannaDx™ detects other cannabinoids (such as CBD and CBN) as well as 20+ terpenes, providing you with a Total Canna Profile™ (TCP) – or a more comprehensive chemical analysis of your cannabis. These raw numbers are then matched against our lab tested chemical database and crowdsourced consumer feedback to provide you with a prediction of how this cannabis might make you feel and what symptoms it has been reported to potentially alleviate by other MyDx users. Using this track and predict feature will allow you to find a strain, or a Total Canna Profile™, that works for you. As seen in the video below, MyDx™ introduces an extremely easy and convenient method for cannabis testing.

Total Canna Profile™ (TCP™)
Cannabis contains over 400 compounds including cannabinoids, flavonoids, terpenes, fatty acids, and more, all with potential medical uses.

These compounds work together to create an Entourage Effect – the total physiological effects resulting from a particular strain. This Entourage Effect is a direct result of the chemical composition of the cannabis in question. A Total Canna Profile™ (TCP) is a more comprehensive view of the majority of the chemical components, and therefore knowing the TCP and tracking the TCP effects allows users to more reliably predict the physiological impact of cannabis on their minds and bodies.


The MyDx Total Canna Profile™ (TCP) is a proprietary cannabis index based on a set of algorithms and associated data resulting from using the MyDx handheld analyzer and mobile app. The TCP is essentially a summary of the  cannabinoids and terpenes and other compounds detected by our sensor.  It’s like a unique fingerprint.  The TCP provides a user with the ability to find a cannabis strain that works for them and correlate it with a desired effect, whether that be symptom relief or simply how it makes them feel.


Personal Profile – everyone reacts differently to cannabis and on top of that different cannabis strains can cause a myriad of different effects. Therefore, questions such as “what cannabis strain is best?” can only be answered from the perspective of the individual consuming it. Your cannabis experience relies on your own endocannabinoid system, your mental state prior to consuming cannabis, as well as the concentrations of natural compounds found in cannabis (such as cannabinoids and terpenes). The result is a complex and personalized experience that can be difficult to capture and classify. MyDx™ will allow you to do just that. You can track and predict how a strain might make you feel and what symptoms it might help relieve. In this way, the MyDx Analyzer can help provide answers to the age-old questions;
“How Will This Sample Make Me Feel?”
or
“What Symptoms Will This Sample Help Me Relieve?

Cannabinoids
Cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), are molecules that target receptors found throughout the body providing relief to an array of symptoms including pain, nausea, and inflammation. The principal  cannabinoids found in cannabis are THC, CBD, and cannabinol (CBN).
It is important to note that many other relevant cannabinoids such as THCv, which has been reported as an appetite suppressant, as compared to THC, which is typically reported as an appetite stimulant, are very much relevant and might be reflected in our TCP sensor response.  However, we do not at this time report a THCv values in our system as part of the TCP report.
Summary of the Principal Cannabinoids

Terpenes






Terpenes are what give cannabis its amazingly complex taste and smell. Without terpenes, cannabis would be very bland because THC and other cannabinoids have no distinguishable odor or taste. Alpha-pinene, myrcene, limonene, and linalool may not roll off the tongue, but their sensory descriptors like piney, musky, fruity, tropical, spicy, floral, and citrusy immediately conjure up memories of familiar tastes and aromas. It’s then no surprise to learn that terpenes aren’t unique to cannabis – they can be found in everything from plants and herbs to fruits and spices. Terpenes are an important component to the overall cannabis experience, not only influencing a strain’s taste and smell but also influencing its effects on the body (summarized in the table below). The total medicinal effect of all of the components in cannabis is referred to as the “entourage effect”. This documented phenomenon is what distinguishes one strain from another, and research shows it relies heavily on the physiological effects produced by terpenes. 
	
Summary of the Five Most Common Terpenes

Entourage Effect
 Sometimes you just find a strain that totally works for you. It’s all about the right ratio of terpenes and cannabinoids and the entourage effects that ratio produces. The result is a unique cannabis experience that essentially distinguishes the wide variety of strains (and their chemotypes). Clearly, the entourage effect should not be underestimated. Research shows that these synergistic effects lead to three to four times the medical efficacy; meaning a full cannabis extract will be three to four times as effective as a THC-only extract. Synergistic compounds also help mitigate some of the negative side effects of the primary constituents, THC in this case.
Summary of the Entourage Effect

MyDx: Welcome to Cannabis 2.0
When all of these variables are analyzed in the context of the data contained within a TCP, users experience a new way of consuming cannabis. Cannabis 2.0, wherein the user can directly track, predict, and record the effectiveness of a strain (or TCP) depending on their own specific needs. Essentially, this is cannabis tailored to the users’ needs. In order to help users get their desired cannabis experience MyDx utilizes all of this information to relate cannabinoid and terpenes content into feelings and symptom relief. The two tables below summarize these findings. 





 MyDx leverages the data above, a HIPPA compliant and secured crowd-sourced database, the resulting TCP, and proprietary algorithms to relate the concentrations measured into how that strain might make users feel and what symptoms it can potentially relieve. As the crowd-sourced database grows, so will MyDx’s ability to relate TCPs to users’ experiences. Similarly, the more a user tests and tracks their experiences the better MyDx will become at predicting the characteristics of future cannabis samples. By finding similar TCPs, MyDx allows users to more consistently find strains that deliver their desired effects.
Key Features of MyDx/CannaDx


			MyDx offers four main features to users: the ability to analyze cannabis samples for a TCP, to track how that TCP affected them, to seek similar TCPs to ones that worked for them, and to get information on where to find those strains, or TCPs, that delivered the experience they desire. The App screenshots below highlight these features. 
	

   
	     
MyDx provides the entire cannabis industry with the tools and knowledge needed to truly get the most out of their cannabis. We aim to bring manufacturers, distributors, consumers, and regulators together under a common goal of transparency, consistency, and reliability.
* DISCLAIMER: IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS TO BE ADVISED THAT ANY CLAIMS REGARDING THE MEDICAL BENEFITS OF CANNABIS ARE STILL UNDER RESEARCH AND UNTIL APPROVED BY THE FDA OR ANY OTHER RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY BODY, ARE CONSIDERED ANECDOTAL IN NATURE.

MyDx – Analyzer / Sensor – Electronic Nose TechnologyHome / MyDx – Analyzer / Sensor – Electronic Nose Technology




Electronic Nose Technology in the Palm of Your Hand.
MyDx™ is a portable analyzer that leverages over 2 generations of patented technology developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and put to practical use by NASA.  MyDx is engineered to act as an electronic nose that is able to detect molecules in vapor.  When a sample is placed in the testing chamber of the MyDx, the sample will be analyzed using our gas flow over-the-sensor system that supports the chemical release process and exposes the chemicals that are present.


Our bodies have 1,000 chemically different types of odorant receptors. A single receptor recognized multiple odorants and a single odorant is recognized by multiple receptors. Odorants may be identified by pattern combinations of activated receptors.



Acting as an electronic nose,MyDx is engineered to detect molecules in vapor. The sample that is placed in the MyDx device is analyzed by multiple sensors exposing the chemicals that are present.



The vapors cause swelling which induce resistance changes. MyDx is able to quantify THC to within 20% of conventional gas chromatography instruments. Our subsequent generation devices and sensors will target a marginal error rate within 5% of GC values.



Within minutes, the app will provide you with an in-depth analysis of the sample, including exactly what the information means and why you should care.


MyDx™ Sensors
We have successfully launched our CannaDx™ sensor and our R&D department is currently working on developing our three other sensors, OrganaDx™, AquaDx™, and AeroDx™, which should be available within the coming months.



Canna Dx™The CannaDx™ sensor will allow you to test your cannabis potency (% THC) on site and within a matter of minutes, but this proprietary sensor goes even beyond that. CannaDx™ detects other cannabinoids (such as CBD and CBN) as well as 20+ terpenes, providing you with a Total Canna Profile™ (TCP) – or a complete chemical analysis of your cannabis. These raw numbers are then matched with our extensive database providing you with an accurate prediction of how this cannabis will make you feel and what symptoms it can potentially relieve. Using this track and predict feature will allow you to find a strain, or a Total Canna Profile™, that works for you.
Organa Dx™The OrganaDx™ sensor allows users to measure the levels of pesticides found in the food they eat. OrganaDx™ gives you the ability to Trust and Verify™ that the organic food that you have purchased is in fact free of harmful pesticides. Unfortunately, pesticides are still commonly found in produce, even in supposedly organic produce. The health consequences can be serious, as countless studies have linked pesticides to major health problems.
Aqua Dx™The AquaDx™ sensor was designed to detect the presence of harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, in your water. AquaDx™ allows you to Trust and Verify™ the safety and purity of your drinking water. This sensor is ideal for travelers or people who live abroad where water regulations are less stringent. 
Aero Dx™The AeroDx™ is designed to measure the surrounding air quality in order to ensure the safety and purity of the air you breathe. This sensor is perfect for users who live in urban areas or for those who travel abroad where air quality regulations are less stringent. It doesn’t matter where you are or what time it is, at the push of a button you can easily test the quality of the air you breathe. This makes AeroDx™ ideal for people who have sensitive respiratory systems.

For what Medicinal purposes can MyDx suggest Cannabis Strains?
MyDx tests for the Total Chemical Profile of the plant and correlates that with your feelings, or your symptoms, so you can find a strain profile that works for you.  We hope CannaDx will help cancer patients track strains that have been shown to suppress tumor cell growth, relieve pain and increase energy.. We also hope the MyDx App can help patients identify strains that have been shown to alleviate stress and anxiety for insomnia sufferers.

Does MyDx ship Internationally? What are the costs?
Yes.  Standard shipping rates with major carriers will be available (FedEx, UPS, USPS).  Shipping costs will vary depending on the shipping method requested.  The shipping charge is calculated when the online order form is being entered.  Regulatory rules in various countries differ.  We cannot control the rules and regulations that will govern how quickly MyDx will get to certain countries. We are working as fast as we can to obtain approvals, but we want to let you know that this is a variable we cannot control, especially given some of the markets we are targeting.

Is there a cleaning procedure for the Disposable Sample Inserts or do you need to use a new one each time?
To insure the accuracy of testing we highly recommend you discard the disposable sample insert after each use (except for testing empty inserts).  Cleaning and reusing the inserts may compromise your test results.

MyDx Analyzer
MyDx Analyzer Questions

How Does MyDx Analyzer Work?
They MyDx Analyzer is an electronic nose that utilizes interchangeable sensors to identify the chemical signatures of organic properties in cannabis, food, water and air. The MyDx Analyzer electronically “smells” the sample by drawing the samples vapors across the various channels in each sensor. The MyDx Analyzer connects via Bluetooth or USB cable to Android, iOS or computer devices. The MyDx App communicates with a secure MyDx Cloud via the Internet. The electronic signature obtained from the sensor is then analyzed against a sophisticated database and algorithm in the MyDx Cloud.

How easy is the MyDx to use?
The simplicity behind the design of MyDx will allow you to go from sample to answer in 3 easy steps:
1. Connect the MyDx device to your Smartphone via USB or Bluetooth.
2. Place a few milligrams of the sample in the chamber
3. Begin testing.
The MyDx App will present an in-depth analysis of your sample, what the information means, and why it is important.

How does MyDx replace the existing way we test for cannabis?
In most countries across the world, people do not have the ability to know what is in their cannabis. In the United States, testing for the safety and potency of cannabis is limited to a few states that have central testing labs that offer such a service. For those that have access to this service, the cost can be anywhere from $50 – $300 USD per sample, you must hand-deliver the sample to the lab, and the testing process takes a few days to complete. Additionally, the lab requires up to a few grams of cannabis to produce an accurate analysis, which can further add to your cost. MyDx will put the power of a testing lab in the palm of your hands, in real-time, and at a fraction of the cost using only milligrams of your cannabis.

How does MyDx replace the existing way we test for water, organic purity and air quality?
Government agencies currently monitor these parameters. However, MyDx will empower consumers to trust & verify the quality of everything they eat, drink and inhale. MyDx will be useful for both people who reside in urban environments and also in remote regions of the world where food, water, and air quality are not as closely regulated or for those that travel often to those destinations.

What is the vision for CannaDx?
The vision includes a plan for CannaDx to be used in states where medical or recreational marijuana is legal. The ultimate goal is for patients to understand exactly what and how much of each component they are putting in their bodies as the cannabis industry begins its journey toward legalization and regulation.

What can affect the Test Results?
It is possible that oils or other substances on your hands could impact the sample data.  You should always wash your hands before inserting a new sample or wear rubber gloves.  You should always test in an area with clean air.  Smoky environments may impact the test results.  The cannabis flower sample should not be totally dry since a more fresh sample is needed to get a good chemical profile reading.

What does the CannaDx™ Sensor Analyze?
The CannaDx sensor is currently designed test for the presence of the most important compounds of interest in cannabis flower, including Cannabinoids and Terpenes.  Oils, hash, solvents, edibles, acid, shatter, keif and wax testing is not available but is being considered for future versions.
When presented with a sample of flower cannabis, MyDx will deliver a strain analysis revealing the a broader chemical profile of the plant, including the percentages of medically relevant Cannabinoids such as THC, and a class of compounds known as the Terpenoids, which give each strain of cannabis its unique smell and further contribute to the overall medical effect of the plant.

Why does the Sensor need to be replaced?
During testing vapors are drawn across the sensors.  Over time the residue from the vapors builds up on the sensors surface eventually coating them to where they do not analyze the sample properly.

Troubleshooting Tips For MyDx and App
Troubleshooting For MyDx And App
Before troubleshooting, carefully read the MyDx User Manual.  It is on the CDx web site at:
 https://www.cdxlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MyDx-User-Manual-150302.pdf

Apple iOS devices must have version 7 or greater operating system.  Android devices must be using version 4.4 or greater operating system.
Make sure you have your Bluetooth settings enabled.  If the MyDx is on, it will show up as OLS425.
Check the MyDx power switch to make sure it is turned on and the green indicator light is lit.
Make sure you are not in Simulation mode.  You can go into the MyDx App settings and select Do you have a MyDx Device?  Make sure it is set to Yes and Save the changes. 
If you have problems syncing with the MyDx device, your phone or tablet may not be using Bluetooth version 4.  Older versions will not work and there is no way to tell in the device settings so the manufacturer should be contacted.  A list of known Bluetooth version 4 compatible devices can be found on Bluetooth’s web site at http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices-List.aspx#SmartReady
Make sure you don’t have any other Bluetooth devices on nearby.
If the App “freezes” or does not return test results, make sure you have a strong Internet connection by WiFi or direct using your phone or tablet.  You may need to move to another location to improve your WiFi connection.  A consistently good connection is required for the App to sync with the MyDx database in the cloud. 
If the App stops during a test when receiving a phone call on your smartphone you will need to run the test again.  Putting your smartphone on Do Not Disturb settings will also correct this.
Close the MyDx App and restart it.
Shut both the MyDx and the smartphone off and then turn them both on again.

Restart your MyDx Analyzer by turning it off and then on again.
Reset network settings by tapping Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.
o This will reset all network settings including: previously connected Wi-Fi networks and passwords, recently used Bluetooth accessories, VPN, and APN settings.

The sample chamber will not close or opens when pushed closed

Make sure the MyDx is on a flat surface and not on its side.
Make sure the sample insert is not over filled and the sample insert is closed completely.
Try closing the chamber without a sample insert in it.  If it closes, try a different sample insert.
Pull the sample chamber all the way out and reinsert until you hear a click indicating it is locked in place.

Company Receives Initial Product Sales from its Canadian Campaign as it Ramps Up Over the Coming Month   SAN DIEGO, June 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MyDx, Inc. (MYDX), a science and technology company and creator of MyDx® (My Diagnostic), the first multi-use handheld chemical analyzer initially designed for cannabis professionals and retail consumers to measure the chemicals in cannabis and track their feedback on how each sample is impacting their physiology, today announced that as a direct result of its recently launched Canadian Product Marketing Campaign, it has begun receiving additional sales orders from Canada. Further, it plans to engage outside sales agencies that will partner with MyDx to increase product sales on a commission basis.   Photo - http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/529341/MyDx_I...e_2017.jpg   MyDx Intends to Further Penetrate Canada's ~$9bn Cannabis Market with its New Marketing and Sales Partners   The primary objective of MyDx's business development and market awareness efforts is to help people Trust & Verify® their consumption habits with CannaDxTM, consider alternative delivery Smart Devices like the MyDx ECO Smart PenTM that has the potential to limit abuse and enhance safer use, and leverage the MYDX 360TM service to support access to crowdsourced formulation data for new market entrants, Canadian biopharmaceutical companies and licensed growers.   The second objective was to support the LGBT community with the launch of its Take Pride in Your HighTM campaign. It did so with prominent mobile super boards at Toronto's Gay Pride Parade as illustrated in the image above. Further market awareness efforts were seen across Ontario and Vancouver radio stations, taxi cab advertisements and highway super boards, some examples of which can be viewed HERE.   Finally, MyDx plans to engage experienced outside sales agencies with localized experience who have had success in selling technical products for high profile brands in mass markets. The strategic objective is to expand its sales channel efforts globally beyond its current direct to consumer sales channel, which has been the primary source of its sales to date through www.mydxlife.com and www.cdxlife.com.   "With the help of the right seasoned Branding, Advertising, and Sales agencies, we have significantly strengthened our brand and ability to expand into new marketing and sales channels. Over the next several months, we will initially focus on big box Canadian retailers and seek partners with a solid network of licensed growers. Combine this with our recent financial progress, where MYDX achieved positive cash flow in Q1 of this year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on the market momentum. We are more optimistic than ever before about the future of MyDx, and we appreciate the faith and support of our loyal shareholders," concluded Daniel Yazbeck, CEO of MyDx.
