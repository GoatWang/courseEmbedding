About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Steven Tyler and Craig Jackson’s Barrett-Jackson to Auction Rare Hennessey Venom GT Spyder for Charity October 26, 2016Posted by Barrett-Jackson Rock and roll legend Steven Tyler and Barrett-Jackson chairman & CEO Craig Jackson in front of Tyler’s Hennessey Venom GT Spyder.Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and four-time Grammy winner Steven Tyler to sell an extremely rare Hennessey Venom GT Spyder to benefit Janie’s Fund at Barrett-Jackson’s 46th Annual Scottsdale Auction in January 2017Tyler’s Venom GT Spyder will be on display at the 2016 SEMA Show in Barrett-Jackson’s booth, November 1-4SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Oct. 26, 2016 –Barrett-Jackson, The World’s Greatest Collector Car Auctions®, will auction a Hennessey Venom GT Spyder owned by rock and roll legend Steven Tyler at its 46th Annual Scottsdale Auction in January 2017. The supercar will also be on display at the 2016 SEMA Show in Barrett-Jackson’s booth, November 1-4.This rare supercar is the fifth of only 12 Hennessey Venom GTs ever created and first of the Spyder convertibles. It will cross the auction block at No Reserve, with 100 percent of the hammer price benefiting Janie’s Fund, an initiative created in partnership with Tyler and Youth Villages to bring hope and healing for many of the country’s most vulnerable girls who have suffered the trauma of abuse and neglect.“Charity car sales create some of the most memorable moments from our Scottsdale auctions,” said Craig Jackson, chairman and CEO of Barrett-Jackson. “This past January, we had the VIN #001 Acura NSX, benefiting the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and Camp Southern Ground, and last year we sold the VIN #001 Ford GT350R with the entire hammer price going to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. A world-renowned celebrity like Steven Tyler donating a car as rare and desirable as the Hennessey Venom GT Spyder will undoubtedly be the next great moment for charity cars in Scottsdale, and I’m proud that Barrett-Jackson can be a platform to support a wonderful cause like Janie’s Fund.”Tyler’s Venom GT Spyder is the convertible version of the record-setting Venom GT that recorded a top speed of 270.49 mph at Kennedy Space Center in 2014. This specific vehicle belonging to Tyler is the first of the six Spyder convertibles produced. The 7.0-liter V8 engine produces 1,244 horsepower that muscles the 2,743-pound convertible from 0-60 mph in 2.7 seconds and 0-200 mph in 14.5 seconds. This car also has a custom JL Audio stereo system befitting a rock and roll superstar.Barrett-Jackson’s 46th Annual Scottsdale Auction will take place January 14-22 at WestWorld of Scottsdale, AZ.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Barrett-Jackson, 
      The World’s Greatest Collector Car Auctions®, will auction a Hennessey 
      Venom GT Spyder owned by rock and roll legend Steven Tyler at its 46th 
      Annual Scottsdale Auction in January 2017. The supercar will also be on 
      display at the 2016 SEMA Show in Barrett-Jackson’s booth, November 1-4.
    


      This rare supercar is the fifth of only 12 Hennessey Venom GTs ever 
      created and first of the Spyder convertibles. It will cross the auction 
      block at No Reserve, with 100 percent of the hammer price benefiting Janie’s 
      Fund, an initiative created in partnership with Tyler and Youth 
      Villages to bring hope and healing for many of the country’s most 
      vulnerable girls who have suffered the trauma of abuse and neglect.
    

      “Charity car sales create some of the most memorable moments from our 
      Scottsdale auctions,” said Craig Jackson, chairman and CEO of 
      Barrett-Jackson. “This past January, we had the VIN #001 Acura NSX, 
      benefiting the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and Camp Southern 
      Ground, and last year we sold the VIN #001 Ford GT350R with the entire 
      hammer price going to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. 
      A world-renowned celebrity like Steven Tyler donating a car as rare and 
      desirable as the Hennessey Venom GT Spyder will undoubtedly be the next 
      great moment for charity cars in Scottsdale, and I’m proud that 
      Barrett-Jackson can be a platform to support a wonderful cause like 
      Janie’s Fund.”
    

      Tyler’s Venom GT Spyder is the convertible version of the record-setting 
      Venom GT that recorded a top speed of 270.49 mph at Kennedy Space Center 
      in 2014. This specific vehicle belonging to Tyler is the first of the 
      six Spyder convertibles produced. The 7.0-liter V8 engine produces 1,244 
      horsepower that muscles the 2,743-pound convertible from 0-60 mph in 2.7 
      seconds and 0-200 mph in 14.5 seconds. This car also has a custom JL 
      Audio stereo system befitting a rock and roll superstar.
    

      Barrett-Jackson’s 46th Annual Scottsdale Auction will take place January 
      14-22 at WestWorld of Scottsdale, AZ. For more information on becoming a 
      bidder, follow the link to http://www.Barrett-Jackson.com/Bidder/Home.
