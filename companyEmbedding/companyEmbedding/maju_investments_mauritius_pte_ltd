Chesapeake aims to raise $5 billion



May 12th, 2010 | 
Author: otreva


By MURRAY EVANS Associated Press Writer
OKLAHOMA CITY — Chesapeake Energy Corp. said Monday it plans to raise about $5 billion over the next two years in an effort to expand its investment in oil and natural gas liquids and to reduce its debt.
Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake announced a “strategic and financial plan” that includes the sale of up to a 20 percent equity interest in its Chesapeake Appalachia LLC subsidiary to investors within the next three to 12 months. Chesapeake is a key driller in the Appalachian Basin, with 24 operating rigs in the Marcellus Shale natural gas play.
Chesapeake also announced a private placement of $600 million of a new series of convertible preferred stock to investors in Asia. The investors, Maju Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd. and Hampton Asset Holding Ltd., will have an option for up to $500 million more shares within the next 30 days.
Of the $5 billion to be raised, Chesapeake said it plans to use $3.5 billion to pay off its debt and $1.5 billion to focus on drilling for oil and natural gas liquids.
Chesapeake also is looking at negotiating various joint ventures as part of its plan, which the company said is ultimately designed to achieve an investment grade rating for its debt securities.
Chesapeake is one of the top independent natural gas producers in the U.S. but has gradually expanded its oil and natural gas liquids portfolio in recent months. Company spokesman Jim Gipson said natural gas accounted for about 90 percent of Chesapeake’s production in the first quarter of 2010, down from 93 percent a year ago.
Chesapeake’s CEO Aubrey McClendon has spoken in recent weeks about the company’s interest in expanding its oil and natural gas liquids production, noting that oil prices are rising while the cost of natural gas is stagnant. Crude oil rose $1.69 to $76.80 per barrel Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange while natural gas rose 15.5 cents to $4.170 per 1,000 cubic feet.
In a production update issued last week, Chesapeake said it is trying to identify more supplies of oil and natural gas liquids.

The investors include Maju Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned investment holding company of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek), and RRJ Capital.
Chesapeake Energy Corp currently owns about 26 percent of Frac Tech.
After the deal, Chesapeake’s ownership will increase to 30 percent, the company said.
Frac Tech said the investors have received $1.7 billion debt financing commitment from their financial advisors.
The company, whose customers include Petrohawk Energy Corporation , XTO Energy Inc, Chesapeake and Range Resources Corp , said it expects the transaction to close in the second quarter.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup are serving as the financial advisors to Chesapeake, Temasek and RRJ Capital, the company added.
