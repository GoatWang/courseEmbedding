About us


Who we are
Omnicap is active in virtually all areas of municipal finance.  We are a registered Municipal Advisor and nationally recognized financial and investment advisory services firm established in 2004. Omnicap is registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an investment advisor (CRD # 133387) and we are a registered municipal advisor with both the SEC (# 867-00683) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (# K0142).  Our public finance practice is one of the largest in the nation and our diverse backgrounds and commitment to teamwork and client service have earned us recognition as one of the foremost financial advisory, investment advisory, derivative advisory and arbitrage rebate compliance services firms in the country.

Fiduciary duty to our clients
Our fiduciary duty to our clients includes a duty of loyalty and a duty of care.  Omnicap has a fiduciary responsibility to our clients and we are independent of any financial institution or securities brokerage firm.  We provide sound, independent advice that is in the best interest of our clients. 
Experience and resources
Our team is comprised of industry professionals with broad experience and a long history of providing clients with municipal advisory services that cover both the pre-issuance and post-issuance process.  We strive to offer our clients exceptional resources to provide consistent, high quality services that add value to our clients’ bottom line.
Delivering value and exceptional services consistently
Our capabilities mirror our clients’ needs. Our business model focuses on providing exceptional services to a managed number of clients so we can administer our engagements in a manner that allows us to deliver what we promise without overloading our resources.  We strive to be considered an extension of our client’s internal staff.
Expertise from pre-issuance to closing to maturity
Omnicap offers both pre-issuance and post-issuance advice. Whether it’s in the planning and structuring phase, transaction phase, or after the closing of the transaction, Omnicap’s experience has you covered.  Most firms stop providing service once the transaction is closed.  Post-issuance advisory services have the potential to save our clients millions of dollars by reinvesting bond proceeds, terminating investment agreements or swaps, reducing arbitrage rebate due to the IRS, or finding alternative solutions when market conditions become difficult or volatile.

New York, NY. Nixon Peabody LLP, a full-service law firm with one of the largest public finance practices in the U.S., and OmniCap Group LLC, a provider of investment advisory/management, arbitrage rebate and consulting services, announce a strategic alliance to enhance their representation of clients in the public finance and tax arenas, including investment management, arbitrage rebate, tax compliance, investment advisory services, and consulting, as well as traditional bond and tax counsel services.  The alliance, which includes a strategic investment by Nixon Peabody in OmniCap, expands the capabilities of Nixon Peabody and OmniCap and provides each firm’s clients with access to a team of the industry’s leading tax and finance professionals whose capabilities cover a broad spectrum of public finance services. In addition, OmniCap is expected to expand its operations significantly as a result of Nixon Peabody’s investment. Nixon Peabody regularly ranks among the most active bond and underwriter counsels nationally and is recognized for its innovative work in a wide range of public finance projects. Nixon Peabody’s clients include state and local governments, underwriters, bond insurers, banks and corporate and not-for-profit entities. An important aspect of the firm’s public finance practice is the depth and strength of its tax law experience and capabilities. With the increasing emphasis from the Internal Revenue Service on enforcement, Nixon Peabody’s tax lawyers are increasingly sought out to represent issuers, borrowers, investment banks, and other law firms in IRS audits, private letter rulings, and in structuring transactions. Nixon Peabody’s tax lawyers have successfully represented governmental entities and associations in obtaining both legislative and regulatory relief. OmniCap provides investment management, arbitrage rebate, tax consulting and financial advisory services, and with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and Tampa. OmniCap provides consulting services to some of the largest bond issuers in the country and represents a number of clients on claims filed with the Internal Revenue Service. OmniCap has worked extensively with clients and issuers from every geographic region involving every segment of the tax exempt finance community. Prior to starting OmniCap, the founding members built a multi-billion dollar investment management and advisory practice, and led the management and creation of the largest arbitrage rebate practice in the country, completing more than 3,500 rebate reports per year. Mitch Rapaport, a tax partner in Nixon Peabody’s Public Finance Practice, said, “We have been looking to provide our clients with high-quality arbitrage rebate and related tax compliance service to complement the public finance legal services that we provide. The opportunity to work together with the OmniCap team—people who are the best in the industry with years of experience and a strong national practice—is exactly what we were hoping to achieve. Through this strategic alliance, Nixon Peabody and OmniCap have dramatically enhanced the services that we can provide to participants in the public finance industry in the tax, arbitrage rebate and other areas. We look forward to offering our clients the ability to take advantage of OmniCap’s specialized skills. With the establishment of our alliance with OmniCap, Nixon Peabody has once again demonstrated the firm’s ongoing commitment to expanding and developing its prominent position in the public finance marketplace.” Jeff Smith, President of OmniCap, stated, “Teaming with Nixon Peabody will greatly benefit our clients, and it strengthens our truly unique and extraordinary business platform. Nixon Peabody is renowned for its bond counsel practice and the depth of its experience in handling tax matters. The ability to work with Nixon Peabody’s financial advisory subsidiaries—Nixon Peabody Financial Advisory and Nixon Peabody Fiduciary Services—provides us with seamless access to additional resources that will enhance our services. Above all else, we are excited to build an alliance with a world-class firm that shares our commitment to our people, our clients and to the public finance industry.” Organizations interested in accessing the services of Nixon Peabody and OmniCap should contact Jeff Smith at (310) 937-6195 (jsmith@omnicapgroupllc.com) or Mitch Rapaport at (202) 585-8305 (mrapaport@nixonpeabody.com).
