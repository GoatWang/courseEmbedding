NEW YORK - Vantiv Inc. launched six new products in 2015. Five of them involved security enhancements that help merchants and banks guard against hackers.“It is part of every conversation,” said Todd Lasher, vice president of business development and partnerships for Vantiv, a Symmes Township-based payment-processing company with 3,300 employees, including 1,300 in Cincinnati.“Every CIO and CEO in our world is taking about security,” Lasher said in an exclusive WCPO interview at the National Retail Federation’s 2016 Big Show in New York. “They want to talk about lowering transaction cost. Then, they want to talk about preserving and protecting their companies and their data security. So, it is a big part of the sales process and a big part of the ongoing conversation in the industry.”Vantiv is a 2012 spin-off from Fifth Third Bancorp, which continues to benefit from the divestiture. The bank remains its largest investor despite selling off millions of shares over time, including a December transaction that netted $419 million for the bank. Vantiv has roughly doubled in revenue since splitting from Fifth Third, racking up $2.3 billion in revenue through nine months of 2015.Become a WCPO Insider to learn how Vantiv is winning converts with a fleet of new security products.

NEW YORK - Vantiv Inc. launched six new products in 2015. Five of them involved security enhancements that help merchants and banks guard against hackers.“It is part of every conversation,” said Todd Lasher, vice president of business development and partnerships for Vantiv, a Symmes Township-based payment-processing company with 3,300 employees, including 1,300 in Cincinnati.“Every CIO and CEO in our world is taking about security,” Lasher said in an exclusive WCPO interview at the National Retail Federation’s 2016 Big Show in New York. “They want to talk about lowering transaction cost. Then, they want to talk about preserving and protecting their companies and their data security. So, it is a big part of the sales process and a big part of the ongoing conversation in the industry.”Vantiv is a 2012 spin-off from Fifth Third Bancorp, which continues to benefit from the divestiture. The bank remains its largest investor despite selling off millions of shares over time, including a December transaction that netted $419 million for the bank. Vantiv has roughly doubled in revenue since splitting from Fifth Third, racking up $2.3 billion in revenue through nine months of 2015.Vantiv sent a team of 40 sales reps to meet with retailers in New York last week, all of them touting a product roster that included three new security enhancements launched since September.


Vantiv eProtect, an enhanced eCommerce data security solution launched Dec. 1.

		Vantiv’s eCommerce Fraud Tool Kit announced several new service levels on Oct. 22.

Omnishield Assure, a security suite to protect small- to mid-sized businesses, launched Sept.8.

Vantiv is scheduled to reveal fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 3 with an analysts feeling bullish on the stock. A Jan. 28 upgrade from “neutral” to “positive” by Susquehannah is the third ratings upgrade since early December by Wall Street analysts. Sun Trust Robinson rates the stock a buy, and Credit Suisse expects it will “outperform” the market.Payment processing companies are increasingly popular with investors because of an industry shift to EMV technology, or credit cards with chips instead of magnetic strips to carry personal data.A string of retail data breaches hastened the move to EMV. Vantiv is gaining new clients because of it.“EMV helps to generate new sales because it really creates a catalyst for a broader conversation about security,” Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker told analysts Oct. 28. “Within our Merchant business, we are processing EMV transactions for several leading retailers and are now processing well over 1 million EMV transactions a day.”Vantiv doesn’t break out revenue by security products, but it’s clear they still represent a small chunk of total revenue. In the quarter ending September 30, only 20 percent of Vantiv’s $430 million in net revenue came from financial institution services, a segment that includes security products. Most of Vantiv’s revenue comes from merchant services, which includes “all aspects of card processing including authorization and settlement, customer service, chargeback and retrieval processing and interchange management,” according to the company’s most recent quarterly report to shareholders.Lasher sees plenty of room for Vantiv to grow revenue from security products because of how it approaches the market. Instead of offering a one-size fits all solution, Vantiv offers a variety of products that are compatible with existing data systems. Whether a client is big or small, advanced or primitive in its approach to data protection, Lasher can find a Vantiv solution that makes consumer data more secure.“We’re not going to sell you vapor ware,” he said. “We’re going to work with you to find what’s the best solution for you.”Vantiv uses tools like tokenization, which means substituting sensitive customer data with information that is useless to data thieves, and point-to-point encryption, which means converting credit card numbers to indecipherable code when a card is scanned.“The reality is you can’t stop a hacker,” Lasher said. “But what you can do is you can neutralize a hacker. So, when somebody hacks, there’s no data. There’s nothing there. From a security perspective, it’s all about shielding the liability, protecting the customer information.”Other vendors take a similar approach, but Vantiv is winning converts. The U.S. Postal Service signed up last summer for a full range of payment-processing and security solutions. Trade publisher Paybefore recently selected Vantiv’s new OmniShield Assure as a winner in the “Fraud Fighter” category in its annual “Pay Awards” competition.

Commission File No.: 001-35462NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATIONTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FIRM INTENTION TO MAKE AN OFFER UNDER RULE 2.7 OF THE CITY CODE ON TAKEOVERS AND MERGERS (THE "CODE") AND THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT AN OFFER WILL BE MADEFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE5 July 2017Vantiv, Inc and Worldpay Group plc agree to key terms of possible offerFollowing the Possible Offer Announcement dated 4 July 2017 ("Possible Offer Announcement"), the boards of directors (the "Boards") of Worldpay Group plc ("Worldpay") and Vantiv, Inc. ("Vantiv") are pleased to announce that they have reached an agreement in principle on the key terms of a potential merger of Worldpay and Vantiv (the "Potential Merger" to form the "Combined Group").Under the terms of the Potential Merger, the ordinary shareholders of Worldpay (the "Worldpay Shareholders") would receive:For each ordinary share in Worldpay (a "Worldpay Share"):£0.55 in cash; and0.0672 new Vantiv shares (the "New Shares")Worldpay Shareholders would also be entitled to a cash dividend of 5 pence per Worldpay Share, in place of any anticipated interim dividend payment to be declared and approved by the Board of Worldpay by the time of Worldpay's Half Year Results 2017. The total value to Worldpay Shareholders would be £3.85 per Worldpay Share comprising the 5 pence dividend payment and £3.80 per Worldpay Share under the terms of the Potential Merger, based on the closing share price of Vantiv on 3 July 2017 of $62.51 (and converted to Pound Sterling using an exchange rate of £1:$1.2921, being the exchange rate at 5:00 pm on 4 July 2017). The Potential Merger terms (excluding the dividend) represent: Following completion of the Potential Merger, Worldpay Shareholders would own approximately 41% of the share capital of the Combined Group on a fully diluted basis.Compelling Strategic and Financial RationaleThe Boards of Worldpay and Vantiv see compelling strategic, commercial and financial rationale for combining Worldpay and Vantiv's complementary businesses. The Potential Merger creates a scale world class payments group in a dynamic market, with deep payments capabilities, product and vertical expertise and strong distribution channels to serve merchants around the world in the global ecommerce market, and in-store and online in the UK and US markets. The Combined Group is expected to benefit from its strong presence and substantial opportunities in integrated payments and global ecommerce. It will serve a wide range of customers, with a strong position in the four core regions of the US, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America, including many of the world's largest ecommerce merchants, and a substantial base of merchants of all sizes in Europe and the US. The Combined Group will benefit from cutting-edge innovation, and substantial engineering capability and talent, with hubs in the UK, Europe and US. The Boards of Worldpay and Vantiv have identified substantial opportunities for cost synergies, which support significant potential shareholder value creation. In addition, the Boards of Worldpay and Vantiv believe that there would be additional revenue growth opportunities that may be realised as a result of the Potential Merger. The Boards of Worldpay and Vantiv believe that the Combined Group will have a strong management team with deep industry experience and a strong track record.Governance and ManagementThe Combined Group will bring together the best of both companies' management to create a world class leadership team. To ensure a successful and smooth integration, the Combined Group will be led by Charles Drucker as Executive Chairman and Co-CEO and Philip Jansen as Co-CEO, with Stephanie Ferris as CFO. The Board of the Combined Group will consist of 4 Worldpay Directors and 7 Vantiv Directors, with both Sir Michael Rake and Jeffrey Stiefler continuing to serve on the Board in non-executive positions.Worldpay Trading UpdateWorldpay's current trading and outlook for the half year is in line with Worldpay's management expectations.Further Details on the Potential MergerFollowing completion of the Potential Merger, Worldpay Shares will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Common stock in Vantiv, which will be the ultimate holding company of the Combined Group, will continue to be listed on The New York Stock Exchange. Discussions between the parties remain ongoing regarding the other terms and conditions of the Potential Merger. Worldpay and Vantiv will proceed with a mutual due diligence process. The terms and conditions of any offer if made will be set out in a further announcement. There can be no certainty that any transaction will occur. Vantiv reserves the right, with the agreement or recommendation of the Worldpay Board, to make an offer for Worldpay, at any time, (a) on less or more favourable terms than the Potential Merger described above; and (b) varying the exchange ratio and/or cash consideration component and/or introducing other forms of consideration. Vantiv reserves the right to reduce the consideration in the event a dividend is declared and paid or becomes payable by Worldpay above the agreed 5 pence dividend. Completion of the Potential Merger will be subject to shareholder approvals and receipt, on satisfactory terms, of regulatory and merger control approvals as appropriate, as well as other customary conditions. In accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the UK Takeover Code, Vantiv is required to clarify its intentions by no later than 5.00pm on 1 August 2017 (or such later date as the Takeover Panel may consent to in accordance with the Code), by either announcing a firm intention to make an offer or that it does not intend to make an offer.

CINCINNATI, Oct. 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Vantiv Integrated Payments, a Vantiv company (NYSE:   VNTV), and a provider of payments technology and services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), today announced two new products, triPOS Cloud and triPOS Mobile, as an extension of the triPOS product line. Now equipped for every use case, software developers creating innovative point of sale solutions can integrate via the cloud or a native application. Vantiv will be demonstrating the two products in the Vantiv booth (#1020) at Money20/20, October 23-26 in Las Vegas. 


























              See how triPOS Mobile from Vantiv Integrated Payments works for small and medium sized businesses.
            











"The innovation occurring in the point of sale software development market is accelerating quickly, and Vantiv is excited to deliver these robust solutions to mobile and cloud developers and resellers. triPOS evolves with your business and works for most merchant industries operating in-store or on the go," said Coy Christensen, senior leader product, Vantiv Integrated Payments. "triPOS will not only enable the latest payment technologies, including emerging payments like Apple Pay and Android Pay, but it protects customer data with validated point to point encryption (P2PE), tokenization and EMV."
Both triPOS Cloud and triPOS Mobile simplify the merchant installation process by using a unique pairing process between PIN pads, merchant lanes and the account details. It is designed to also simplify the payment experience, by removing the complexities around device integrations, EMV certifications and PCI compliance. As new functionality, payment device support, transaction types and gateway capabilities are added to the Express Interface, triPOS PC, Mobile and Cloud easily deliver these enhancements with little or no additional integration work. 
Emporos, a leading provider of pharmacy POS, is one Vantiv partner already using triPOS to drive better adoption with its merchants. Emporos installed its first customer on triPOS in April of this year. Emporos Founder and CEO Greg Phillips described the integration experience as "easy and professional." "When we had questions, they were answered very quickly and completely," said Phillips. "The integration development and coding processed was well-documented, and the changes were addressed in a timely manner. We are very happy with the solution."  
Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) can now begin integrating to triPOS Mobile for iOS. Vantiv is currently piloting triPOS Cloud and launching it broadly in 2017. Developers can connect and integrate to triPOS at Vantiv O.N.E. To view a video on how triPOS Mobile works go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hsh73GMOPY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Not to be confused with Vantive.
Vantiv, Inc. is a public U.S.-based payment processing and technology provider headquartered in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio area. Vantiv is the largest U.S. merchant acquirer ranked by general purpose transaction volume.[1]
The company provides payment and technology services to merchants and financial institutions in the U.S. and processes more than 20.1 billion payment transactions and approximately $726 billion in volume annually. As of 2014, Vantiv supports approximately 400,000 merchant locations and more than 17,000 automated teller machines (ATMs) in 46 states and eight countries.[2]
The company's merchant base includes customers in vertical markets such as retail, restaurant, government, e-commerce, supermarket, drug store, business to business and consumer services.

History[edit]
In 1971, Fifth Third Bank formed Midwest Payment Systems (MPS) to provide Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) services to financial institutions. In 1977, Jeanie, the nation's first shared online ATM network was developed and implemented. In 1991, MPS expanded to offer Merchant Services. In 2000, MPS acquired Integrated Delivery Technologies, Inc. (IDTI), Cartel Network and ACI Merchant Services.[6]
In 2003, Midwest Payment Systems adopted the name Fifth Third Processing Solutions. In 2006, the company acquired Card Management Corporation (CMC) to provide a broader range of processing services. Several years later, in 2009, Fifth Third Processing Solutions spun off from Fifth Third Bancorp and was launched as a joint venture between Advent International and Fifth Third Bank, a subsidiary of Fifth Third Bancorp.[7]
By the end of 2010, the company had acquired TNB Card Services,[8] National Processing Company (NPC)[9] and certain assets of Springbok Services, Inc. Prepaid Platform.[10] In June 2011, Fifth Third Processing Solutions assumed the Vantiv name.[11]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Vantiv shares slump almost 4% after Worldpay offer
Shares of U.S. credit-card processor Vantiv Inc.  slumped almost 4% Wednesday after resuming trading following a halt for the news that it has agreed to merger terms with the U.K.'s Worldpay Group Inc.  in a deal valued at $10 billion. Worldpay and Vantiv announced the deal early Wednesday, beating out rival J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , which said shortly after that it would not be making an offer of its own. Vantiv is offering a total of 3.85 pounds in a cash and stock offer that is about 19% above Worldpay's closing price on Monday. Analysts at Stifel said in a note written before the terms were released that a deal would make strategic sense, although they were wary of it coming at too high a price. Speculation on Tuesday had placed the price at a higher range than the one agreed.  While PayPal's  name was not mentioned in any of the coverage of the deal on Tuesday, "we think it makes sense strategically and wouldn't be surprised to see PYPL enter the fray," they wrote. PayPal shares were last up 2%. Vantiv shares have gained 1.4% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.6%.

Worldpay and Vantiv reach agreement on merger terms
Worldpay Group plc  and Vantiv Inc.  said Wednesday they have reached an agreement in principle on the main terms of a merger, under which Worldpay shareholders would receive 55 pence in cash and 0.0672 new Vantiv shares for each of their Worldpay shares. The British payments processor said Tuesday it had received preliminary takeover approaches from Vantiv, a rival in the U.S., and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. . Under the terms of Vantiv's offer, Worldpay shareholders would also be entitled to a cash dividend of 5 pence per share. The total value of the offer is 3.85 pounds per Worldpay share, or a premium of 18.9% over Worldpay's closing share price on July 3. Worldpay shareholders would own 41% of the combined entity on a diluted basis. "The potential merger creates a scale world class payments group in a dynamic market, with deep payments capabilities, product and vertical expertise and strong distribution channels to serve merchants around the world in the global ecommerce market, and in-store and online in the UK and US markets," the companies said in a joint statement. Vantiv shares were halted in premarket trade for the news, but have gained 5% in 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.
