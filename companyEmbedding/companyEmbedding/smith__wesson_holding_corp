6 Reasons Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. Stock Could Rise
The gunmaker still has several rounds in the chamber to make the coming year a better one than expected.











                Rich Duprey
            

                (TMFCop)



            
            Jan 3, 2017 at 3:18PM
            
            





Although Smith & Wesson Holding (NASDAQ:AOBC) -- soon to be American Outdoor Brands Corporation -- only lost around 4% of its value in 2016, shares of the gunmaker have fallen more than 32% below their 52-week high. The consensus view is that the gun sales boom is over, and even if the industry is returning to a period of "normalization" as Smith & Wesson contends, its stock will at best tread water.
Here are six reasons the gunsmith just might be able to shoot that theory full of holes and see its stock rise in 2017.

Gun control concerns haven't gone away; they have just been displaced from the federal level to the states. Image source: Getty Images.
1. State gun control efforts take precedence
The conventional wisdom is that with the election of Donald Trump to the presidency and Republican control of the House of Congress, the chance any gun control legislation gets a hearing is gone. Even though there was little traction gained during President Obama's administration, there was always fear something would pass and a Supreme Court vacancy to be filled added a sense of urgency to the mix. 
But now, if there is to be any gun control action, it will happen at the state level. This past November, for example, California approved a measure to adopt background checks for ammunition purchases in a bid to make it harder to obtain ammo. Similarly, Nevada approved a "universal" background check that applies to private-party gun sales, though the state's attorney general just declared it "unenforceable" because the FBI won't allow "intermediaries" to run the checks through its system.
The battle for stricter gun control laws will move from the federal level to the states, so the concerns over the efforts haven't been eliminated, just muted somewhat.
2. Personal defense remains a recurrent theme
While gun control fears were thought by many to be the main driving force, the most popular guns sold were those for personal safety. Smith & Wesson's M&P Shield model has been one of the leading handguns on the market, but other popular brands including those made by Glock, Sig Sauer, and Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR), whose LCP model was the top concealed-carry weapon, showed it was self-protection, not gun control, that was the primary motivator.
With civil unrest still percolating under the surface -- there are reportedly mass demonstrations and disruptions planned for Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 -- rising violent crime rates, and acts of terrorism here and abroad, the desire to protect oneself, one's family, and one's property will remain strong. All those analysts expecting gun demand to evaporate may very well be surprised when it doesn't. For many people personal safety trumps the ephemeral fear of gun control.





3. Gun sales remain strong
Any of the mentioned factors could keep the momentum going, but Smith & Wesson has noted that while demand remains strong, there's been an increase in the number of long guns being sold, too. Although they're a smaller component of the gunsmith's total sales (some 23%), long gun shipments more than doubled, far outstripping the gains it saw in handgun shipments, which rose less than 40%.
Smith & Wesson has also admitted it has a gaping hole in the shotgun market that it intends to fill. Although the initial acquisitions it made this year have mostly been in the new rugged outdoors market, expect at least a few of them to target the firearms industry, and it wouldn't be surprising if one was a shotgun maker.

4. Smith & Wesson makes a transformative acquisition
Smith & Wesson has also said it will take great pains to grow inorganically in certain segments, which is why it recently raised its credit limit. On the gunmaker's fiscal 2017 second-quarter earnings call with analysts, CFO James Buchanan said Smith & Wesson has "consistently (tried) to organize our balance sheet to be ready for any one of these kinds of transaction because often the target won't wait -- like for you to go out and get the financing and whatever is needed to do a transaction." So it has its powder dry to make a transformational acquisition, even if small tuck-in or new platform acquisitions are more common.





5. Corporate name change sufficiently separates the stock from guns
As of the first month of the year Smith & Wesson Holding is now officially to be known as American Outdoor Brands. While the name change was effected because the S&W name didn't sufficiently represent the broader rugged outdoors market it was now targeting, or the range of products it offered, it also could have the salutary effect of disguising the stock from the gun issue.
It's true that Smith & Wesson's stock would surge then decline based on the politics of the moment or whatever gun issue was grabbing headlines. Sturm, Ruger' stock similarly rose and fell. However, Vista Outdoors (NYSE:VSTO) did not.
Known mainly as an outdoors gear company like Smith & Wesson is moving into, Vista also sells rifles and shotguns as well as manufactures ammunition and shooting sports gear and supplies. When Trump won the election, Smith & Wesson and Ruger cratered; Vista Outdoors barely budged. By changing its name to American Outdoors Brands, it may smooth out the volatility the stock currently experiences.

6. Smith & Wesson stock is massively undervalued
And last, but from an investor's point of view definitely not least, Smith & Wesson is being incredibly mispriced by the market. It trades at less than 9 times earnings and just 10 times next year's estimates. 
Further, the gunmaker has a fairly clean balance sheet and is able to consistently generate strong cash flow. Its enterprise value of $1.3 billion goes for just 7.6 times its free cash flow, an unbelievable discount for such a strong company.
Short interest in the stock is also at its highest level in over a year. While days to cover has eased in recent weeks to just four days from almost nine days at the end of October (anything over seven is considered a lot), a rally could see short sellers having to cover their positions fueling a further rise in the shares.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Smith & Wesson has produced revolvers over the years in several standard frame sizes. "M refers to the small early Ladysmith frame, I to the small .32 frame, J to the small .38 frame, K to the medium .38 frame, L to medium large, and N to the largest .44 Magnum type frame.[24] In 2003, the even larger X frame was introduced for the .500 S&W Magnum.

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]

Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]




A basic version of Smith & Wesson's SW1911 with user-installed Pachmayr grips.


Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

Blackie Collins designed the subsequent model 6020 and 6060 Survival knife in 1974–1979. All of these limited-production and custom knives were made at the Springfield, Mass., USA factory.
In October 2002, Smith & Wesson announced it had entered into a licensing agreement with Cycle Source Group to produce a line of bicycles designed by and for law enforcement. These bicycles feature custom configurations and silent hubs.[55][56]
Smith & Wesson flashlights are available to the general public. They are designed and produced by PowerTech, Inc, in Collierville, Tennessee.[57]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]

Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]




A basic version of Smith & Wesson's SW1911 with user-installed Pachmayr grips.


Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]

Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

Blackie Collins designed the subsequent model 6020 and 6060 Survival knife in 1974–1979. All of these limited-production and custom knives were made at the Springfield, Mass., USA factory.
In October 2002, Smith & Wesson announced it had entered into a licensing agreement with Cycle Source Group to produce a line of bicycles designed by and for law enforcement. These bicycles feature custom configurations and silent hubs.[55][56]
Smith & Wesson flashlights are available to the general public. They are designed and produced by PowerTech, Inc, in Collierville, Tennessee.[57]
Smith & Wesson has a line of wood pellet grills named after various pistol cartridges, such as .22 Magnum, .38 Special, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum, and .500 Magnum.[58]
Smith & Wesson has entered into a licensing agreement with North Carolina-based Wellco Enterprises to design and distribute a full line of tactical law enforcement footwear.[59]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]




A basic version of Smith & Wesson's SW1911 with user-installed Pachmayr grips.


Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

Smith & Wesson Holding Corp's Best Moves in 2016
It was actually a very good year for the gunslinger, its stock value notwithstanding.











                Rich Duprey
            

                (TMFCop)



            
            Dec 22, 2016 at 7:39PM
            
            





The firearms business might have hit record highs in 2016, but you'd never know it by looking at the stock of Smith & Wesson Holding (NASDAQ:AOBC) -- its shares are down about 1% in 2016. So as the year winds to a close, it might be worthwhile to look at what Smith & Wesson did right even though the market didn't seem to appreciate it.
Here were the best moves the gunslinger made this year that strengthened the business, and ought to position it for even better returns next year and beyond.

Restructuring
Smith & Wesson started off the year announcing a major restructuring of the company. No longer would it rely upon volatile gun sales for the bulk of its revenues, but would instead move in a different direction that would create three new divisions: firearms, manufacturing services, and accessories.
Separating itself from the firearms industry pure-plays like Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR), Smith & Wesson laid the groundwork for the move into accessories with its acquisition of Battenfeld Technologies, which introduced outdoors products from brands like Hooyman, Caldwell, and Wheeler. The new manufacturing services would let it introduce business-to-business services such as forging, heat-treating, plating, and finishing, to third parties that were countercyclical and counter-seasonal to the firearms business -- which would continue on as it had been selling Smith & Wesson-branded guns.
The realignment represented a fresh way of thinking at Smith & Wesson as it diversifies its revenue streams and smooths out the boom and bust gyrations of the firearms industry.

Acquisitions
The restructuring meant Smith & Wesson would need to find additional resources to fill these new divisions. The gunmaker went on a shopping spree, picking up knife maker Taylor Brands, laser sight manufacturer Crimson Trace, and rugged outdoors equipment maker Ultimate Survival Technologies (UST). It also expanded its borrow capacity indicating there was a lot more acquisitions coming in the future.
Although Taylor Brands and Crimson Trace were known quantities to Smith & Wesson because they were also suppliers to it, the purchase of the latter opened up a new avenue for the company as it subsequently created a fourth division, electro-optics, of which Crimson Trace would be the centerpiece. UST, though relatively small and unknown, is a key supplier to the survivalist and extreme outdoors market.
Considering the businesses it purchased and the restructuring it made, the holding company name no longer represented its focus. It wasn't just a gunmaker anymore, but over time would become a diverse retailer of goods and services that ran parallel to firearms, a meaning the name Smith & Wesson name could no longer convey. It proposed changing it to American Outdoor Brands and shareholders just overwhelming approved it, effective Jan. 1.
That makes it more like Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO), which also has an outdoors gear and firearms mix, though whether the name change is a smart move remains to be seen. There's a lot more competition and Smith & Wesson is a small, untested player, but as it will continue to manufacture its firearms under the Smith & Wesson brand, the most important aspect of its financial statements remains intact.

New product introductions
The new businesses may be exciting developments, but they still represent just a tiny portion of Smith & Wesson's overall financial picture. Management believes it may take around five years before it builds out these ancillary ventures to become meaningful components of the business. In the meantime, it needs to rely upon its core strengths, and that includes introducing new products that meet the ever-changing needs of gun buyers.
In 2016, there were three new products in particular that carried the day (or year) for the gunslinger:

Smith & Wesson sport series target pistols
M&P-branded modern sporting rifles
Thompson/Center bolt-action rifles

New product introductions remained key to Smith & Wesson's performance all year long. In its fiscal fourth quarter earlier this year, the target pistols and rifles represented 19.2% of total revenues after they were introduced in January and then they took off from there, accounting for 30.4% of total firearms revenues in the fiscal first quarter and 28.9% in the second.
Smith & Wesson has had troubles meshing the Thompson/Center business into the fold, and the rifles were subsequently subject to a recall, but in all new products remained an important factor in the gunmaker's performance.
Closing out the year
Smith & Wesson's business shouldn't be judged by its stock performance, which reacted more to external forces than what the company was trying to achieve. Indeed, if nothing else, the stock's movement across 2016 underscores the very reason Smith & Wesson took these actions and that means the discounted value those shares trade at ought to make them very attractive to long-term investors.

SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation (NASDAQ Global Select: SWHC), one of the world's leading providers of firearms and quality products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast, today announced financial results for the fiscal second quarter 2017, ended October 31, 2016.








Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Highlights

Quarterly net sales were $233.5 million compared with $143.2 million for the second quarter last year, an increase of 63.0%. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 41.8% compared with 39.2% for the second quarter last year.  
Quarterly GAAP net income was $32.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared with $12.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. 
Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $39.1 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared with $14.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments in net income exclude a number of acquisition-related costs, including amortization, one-time transaction costs, and inventory valuation adjustments.  For a detailed reconciliation, see the schedules that follow in this release. 
Quarterly non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDAS was $72.4 million, or 31.0% of net sales. 
The company acquired substantially all of the net assets of Taylor Brands, LLC ("Taylor Brands") and all of the issued and outstanding stock of Crimson Trace Corporation ("Crimson Trace") for an aggregate of $178.1 million, subject to certain adjustments, utilizing cash on hand. 
The company's unsecured revolving credit line commitment was increased to $500 million from $225 million. 

James Debney, Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which exceeded our financial guidance. In our Firearms Segment, we believe higher revenue was driven by strong consumer demand as reflected in adjusted background checks from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) as well as our own market share gains.  In our Outdoor Products & Accessories Segment, we completed the acquisitions of Taylor Brands and Crimson Trace, both of which were accretive to our non-GAAP earnings."
"Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets of Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc. ("UST"), a provider of high-quality survival and camping products. UST delivered compound annual revenue growth of 49% from 2012 through 2015, maintained healthy gross margins, and developed hundreds of high quality products.  We believe the UST distribution network will create incremental opportunities for our existing accessory product lines."  
"Overall, we are well on our way to achieving our vision of being a leading provider of high-quality products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast.  By executing our strategy, we have successfully grown from a single operating division to four operating divisions that serve a large addressable market and represent more than 18 respected consumer brands.  Accordingly, on January 1, 2017, our holding corporation will become American Outdoor Brands Corporation, pending shareholder approval.  We believe this name better represents our broad range of product offerings and our plan to continue building upon our portfolio of strong American brands.  American Outdoor Brands Corporation will serve as the holding corporation for Smith & Wesson Corp., Battenfeld Technologies, Inc., and Crimson Trace Corporation, which represent our company's firearms, manufacturing services, accessories, and electro-optics divisions.  With a commitment to creating, preserving, and acquiring strong brands, we remain committed to our future growth, focusing on brands and products that best meet the needs and lifestyle of our target consumers," concluded Debney. 
Jeffrey D. Buchanan, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer, said, "During the quarter, we secured a commitment to increase our revolving line of credit to $500 million from $225 million.  This expansion of our unsecured credit line provides us with greater opportunities to invest in our future growth, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our increased access to capital is a clear reflection of the confidence our bankers have in our company as well as the overall strength of our business."

Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures, including "non-GAAP net income," "Adjusted EBITDAS," and "free cash flow" are presented. From time-to-time, the company considers and uses these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide the reader with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends.  The company believes it is useful for itself and the reader to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) TCA accessories transition costs, (iii) discontinued operations, (iv) DOJ and SEC costs including insurance recovery costs, (v) acquisition-related costs, (vi) fair value inventory step-up and backlog expense, (vii) bond premium paid, (viii) debt extinguishment costs, (ix) the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, (x) net cash provided by operating activities, (xi) net cash used in investing activities, (xii) acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, (xiii) receipts from note receivable, (xiv) interest expense (xv) income tax expense, (xvi) depreciation and amortization, and (xvii) stock-based compensation expense; and (2) the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information. The company presents these non-GAAP measures because it considers them an important supplemental measure of its performance. The company's definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. The company believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis.  These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's GAAP measures.  The principal limitations of these measures are that they do not reflect the company's actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its financial measures on a GAAP basis.

Safe Harbor Statement 
Certain statements contained in this press release may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, and we intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor created thereby.  Such forward-looking statements include our belief that higher revenue was driven by strong consumer demand as reflected in adjusted background checks from the NICS system as well as our own market share gains; our belief that the Taylor Brands and Crimson Trace acquisitions were accretive to our non-GAAP earnings; our belief that the UST distribution network will create incremental opportunities for our existing accessory product lines; our belief that we are well on our way to achieving our vision of being a leading provider of high-quality products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast; our expectation that our holding corporation will become American Outdoor Brands Corporation, pending shareholder approval; our belief that this name better represents our broad range of product offerings and our plan to continue building upon our portfolio of strong American brands; our commitment to creating, preserving, and acquiring strong brands and our commitment to our future growth, focusing on brands and products that best meet the needs and lifestyle of our target consumers; our belief that the expansion of our unsecured credit line provides us with greater opportunities to invest in our future growth, both organically and through strategic acquisitions; our belief that our increased access to capital is a clear reflection of the confidence our bankers have in our company as well as the overall strength of our business; and our expectations for net sales, GAAP income per diluted share, acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, fair value inventory step-up and backlog expense, tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, and non-GAAP income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and for fiscal 2017.  We caution that these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by such forward-looking statements.  Such factors include the demand for our products; the costs and ultimate conclusion of certain legal matters; the state of the U.S. economy in general and the firearm industry in particular; general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns; the potential for increased regulation of firearms and firearm-related products; speculation surrounding fears of terrorism and crime; our growth opportunities; our anticipated growth; our ability to increase demand for our products in various markets, including consumer, law enforcement, and military channels, domestically and internationally; the position of our hunting products in the consumer discretionary marketplace and distribution channel; our penetration rates in new and existing markets; our strategies; our ability to introduce new products; the success of new products; our ability to expand our markets; our ability to integrate acquired businesses in a successful manner; the general growth of our outdoor products and accessories business; the potential for cancellation of orders from our backlog; and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.

                Smith & Wesson's Business Strategy            


    By Zaw Thiha Tun | July 15, 2015 — 6:01 AM EDT    






Share
























































Founded in 1852, Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. (SWHC) is an American arms manufacturer whose firearms have seen action in every major world conflict since its inception. Smith & Wesson, the Freedom Group, and Sturm, Ruger & Co, Inc. (RGR) are the Big Three gun producers in the US, responsible for a combined 40 percent of the total market share, according to the Small Arms Survey.
Business
The $838 million market cap company, Smith & Wesson employs 1,758 people, and according to their first quarter 2015 earnings report, the company derives its revenues from selling handguns, long guns, and firearms-related accessories to a wide variety of customers, ranging from civilians seeking home protection to military agencies around the world. S&W is also a leading manufacturer of handcuffs in the United States, as well as a provider of gun smithing and gun cleaning supplies (the complete list of products and brands they sell under can be found in their official filing).
The company's net sales figures for first quarter 2015 came in at $130 million, 11.5 percent below the same quarter in 2014, while net income also dropped to $8.1 million from $20.8 million in 2014. The dramatically inflated numbers in the prior quarters can be attributed to an industry-wide surge in business due to the possibility of gun control measures being introduced in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre. Gun buyers flooded to the market in an effort to purchase their guns before potential legislation got introduced. Subsequently, gun sales, as reflected by the number of checks ran by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check system, exploded to 19.5 and 21 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively, up from 16.4 million in 2011. (See Also: Sandy Hook's Consequences For the Gun Industry.)
S&W’s profits rose along with the NICs numbers, and the company reported the highest all time earnings for fiscal year ended April 2014, with net sales total net sales of $626 million, up six percent from $587 million in FY 2013. (For more, see: How Does Gun Control Policy Affect the Stock Price of Firearms Companies?)
The Rocky Years
Even though Smith & Wesson has been around for over 160 years, things have not always been smooth sailing for the iconic brand. According to ClassicValueInvestors, problems began for S&W during the 1980s when an influx of imported firearms entered the American markets. Smith & Wesson was confident in its brand loyalty and ignored the threat of competition from such firms like Glock Ges.m.b.H. Only when Smith & Wesson began to lose its law enforcement contracts to the lighter, sleeker, and more powerful Austrian-made pistols, did Smith & Wesson decide to take this threat seriously. Unfortunately, by then it was too late, and S&W’s market share had plummeted.
In 2000, the company would face another setback, one that almost drove it to bankruptcy. In the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, US President Bill Clinton proposed measures that would enforce safety and design standards, as well as impose restrictions on magazine size. Voluntarily, the fledging Smith & Wesson agreed to the restrictions, seeing a chance to be part of a "preferred buying program" with various law enforcement agencies and potentially revitalize its popularity with the public. The exact opposite occurred: the National Rifle Association immediately boycotted the company, which resonated with the gun enthusiasts who viewed Smith & Wesson’s act as a form of betrayal. The result was a 40 percent decline in sales in the year after adopting the new safety standards. Then, in May 2001, the company was sold to Saf-T-Hammer Corp., a Scottsdale, Arizona-based firearm safety and security device developer, and in 2002, the company was renamed as the Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.
Turn Around: 2004-2007
Smith & Wesson’s turn around came in 2004 in the form of a new CEO: Michael Golden, who immediately went to work in developing new product lines and reaching new customers. Immediately Golden brought on board sales specialists from Glock’s sales teams and began to use the brand name to win over key police and military contracts. Prior to this, Smith & Wesson was primarily concentrated in the retail sector. Furthermore, after conducting a sales survey and realizing that there was interest for other guns aside from pistols and revolvers, S&W began to develop rifles, shotguns, and ammunition.
The results were remarkable: under Golden’s leadership, S&W’s stock went on a run from $1.45 per share, to $20.09 from 2004-2007. Unfortunately, the good times ended as abruptly as they came with the onset of the 2008 recession, as well as, losses stemming from the acquisition of Thompson/ Center Arms, which drove S&W's stock to a low of $1.53. For the next three years, it would continue to linger below $5.
Present to Future
After trading below $5 per share from 2009-2011, the stock has recovered to $15.69 per share as of last closing mid-June 2015. This resurgence can be attributed to a general recovery of the markets, new government contracts, successful product launches (for example, the Smith & Wesson Military and Police or “M&P” line of firearms has been very well received), and doing away with the Clinton-era policies.
In lieu of a diversified portfolio, the company has decided to concentrate its efforts on winning more contracts and improving what it does best: building guns. For example, in 2012 S&W sold off its security perimeter division to FutureNet, and one of S&W’s most recent purchases in 2014, has been Tri Town Precision Plastics, a maker of polymer frames and other parts for the majority of Smith & Wesson models. The acquisition, as part of a vertical scaling process, added 70-90 basis points to S&W’s gross margins, and could be especially conducive towards the manufacturing of the popular M&P line.
Also in 2014, S&W acquired Battenfeld Technologies, an industry-leading supplier of hunting and shooting accessories that will contribute to S&W’s civilian sales, responsible for 85 percent of its revenues. However, these acquisitions pale in comparison to Smith & Wesson’s announcement to pursue the coveted US Army Modular Handgun System contract, in a partnership with defense industry giant, General Dynamics Ordnance. If successful, this would mark the first instance that Smith & Wesson has secured a highly lucrative, long-term, military contract.  
The Bottom Line
With the cloud of gun control hanging over US firearms manufacturers, it is hard to determine what the near future holds for this sector. However, Smith & Wesson has shown resilience in spite of many systematic and unsystematic setbacks to the company. For now, it seems that Smith & Wesson’s strategy of focusing on producing firearms and accessories seems to be working for the brand, and if the highly lucrative modular pistol contract is won, there is a very strong likelihood that the brand will survive whatever the political climate may unleash.

Smith & Wesson Wants to Change Its Name

                Company seeks permission to be called American Outdoor Brands
            



                Firearms maker has added flashlights, tree saws, fire starters
            













Trump Isn't Great for Gunmakers




Smith & Wesson Holding Corp., maker of handguns carried by Civil War soldiers and Clint Eastwood’s 1970s police character Dirty Harry, is looking to change its name.The board already approved a new moniker for the 164-year-old company starting Jan. 1: American Outdoor Brands Corp. Investors will vote on the change at a Dec. 13 meeting, Smith & Wesson said in a statement Monday. The change only affects the holding company, not the brand name of its guns.The iconic manufacturer, founded by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson in 1852, won fame for producing one of the first successful revolver-style pistols popular in the West. While about 90 percent of its sales are generated from firearms, Smith & Wesson has expanded to four units that include non-weapon products such as flashlights and Hooyman tree saws.




QuickTake Guns in America“We intend to aggressively grow organically and through strategic acquisitions, focusing on brands and products that best meet the needs and lifestyle of our target consumers,” Chief Executive Officer James Debney said in the statement. The company said last week it will acquire the business of Ultimate Survival Technologies, a maker of all-weather fire starters and camp-kitchen gear, for $32.3 million in cash.Product OfferingsThe firearms unit will continue to operate as Smith & Wesson Corp. and sell under that brand name, the company said in a filing. The new name will help differentiate the holding company from the gun subsidiary, the Springfield, Massachusetts-based manufacturer said.“Changing our name is not intended to diminish the importance of the Smith & Wesson brand in our portfolio,” the company said in a regulatory filing. “Rather, our new name will represent a broader and more inclusive platform from which to expand into the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets.”

While the company said the name change wasn’t related to politics, the announcement comes a day before the U.S. presidential election. Typically, any discussion of gun control by political leaders can cause weapons sales and shares of gunmakers to spike. Smith & Wesson jumped as much as 12 percent after a June massacre at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub that left 49 victims dead and sparked comments by President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Clinton calls for “commonsense approaches to reduce gun violence” on her campaign website and said she co-sponsored legislation as a senator that would close “the gun show loophole.”




Republican candidate Donald Trump says on his website that politicians are trying to chip away at the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment. “I won’t let them take away our guns!!” the website says.

Guns With The Best Bang For Your Buck





	Whether you choose Ruger, Glock, Smith & Wesson, Sig Sauer, Taurus or Kimber; Carrying a firearm for self-defense is a steep responsibility. And choosing a gun for concealed carry is an incredibly personal decision. While it can be tempting to go out and purchase the first gun you find on sale--especially in the excitement that follows getting a concealed carry permit--we highly recommend "trying before you buy."

	 

	Online reviews can be helpful, but nothing can replace the real experience of handling and operating a firearm. Try different  makes and models from manufacturers like Ruger and Glock until you find one that feels both comfortable and comforting in your hands. Remember, despite what the guy behind the counter at the gun shop tells you, the "best" gun is the one you will have on you when you need it most!



Choosing a handgun can be a

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

Along with the myriad smaller configurations, the mid-sized 4516, 457, the Chiefs Special CS45, and the decocker equipped, 4546, 4566 and 4576, and the 45 TSW, the 4553, stll being issued to the West Virginia State Troopers.[37]
For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]

Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

John Wilson and Roy G. Jinks designed the Smith & Wesson model 6010 Bowie knife in 1971 and the 1973 Texas Ranger Bowie knife. Blackie Collins designed the subsequent model 6020 and 6060 Survival knife in 1974–1979. All of these limited-production and custom knives were made at the Springfield, Mass., USA factory.
In October 2002, Smith & Wesson announced it had entered into a licensing agreement with Cycle Source Group to produce a line of bicycles designed by and for law enforcement. These bicycles feature custom configurations and silent hubs.[55][56]
Smith & Wesson flashlights are available to the general public. They are designed and produced by PowerTech, Inc, in Collierville, Tennessee.[57]
Smith & Wesson has a line of wood pellet grills named after various pistol cartridges, such as .22 Magnum, .38 Special, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum, and .500 Magnum.[58]
Smith & Wesson has entered into a licensing agreement with North Carolina-based Wellco Enterprises to design and distribute a full line of tactical law enforcement footwear.[59]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]

Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, Wesson stayed on as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms.[5]
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a "Bored-through" cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[5]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.[5]
The Civil War[edit]
Smith & Wesson's revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.[6]
The orders for the Smith & Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities. In 1860 demand was so great that Smith & Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.[6]
At the same time, the company's design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp "Manufactured for Smith & Wesson" on the revolvers in question.[6]
White's vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for armsmakers in the United States at the time as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the end of the war the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.[6]
Western frontier[edit]
Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War and Smith & Wesson focused on the development of arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870 the company introduced a large frame revolver in heavier calibers than the pocket sized revolvers it had been making. The design was known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
Clinton agreement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.[7] The agreement stated that all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith & Wesson's products had to abide by a "code of conduct" to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access, without an adult, to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.[7]
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF over the issue of smart guns,[8] thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.[9][10] Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.[11]
Acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer[edit]
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins.[12] Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million.[13][14] Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.
The acquisition of Smith & Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.[15]
On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.[16]
Recent history[edit]
About 2006 Smith & Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith & Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.[17]
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.[18]
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. [19]

Semi-automatic pistols[edit]
In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1.[25] To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith & Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38.[25] A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith & Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.[25]
The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith & Wesson has continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols now on the market. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.


Smith & Wesson Model 1913—The first centerfire S&W semi-automatic pistol began in 1913. This pistol was also known as the Model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1922.[36]

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame;[citation needed] thus a first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, a first digit of 5 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.[citation needed]
Sigma series[edit]




A Sigma pistol


Main article: Smith & Wesson Sigma
Smith & Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine.[25] Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith & Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line.[38] The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith & Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 1⁄2 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.[25]

SW99 Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SW99
S&W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols.[25] Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith & Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.[25]
M&P Series[edit]




Smith & Wesson M&P pistol.


Main article: Smith & Wesson M&P
In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different back straps supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.
The M&P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG. Also a .22 LR M&P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith & Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
SD VE Series[edit]
Main article: Smith & Wesson SD VE
Smith & Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 in hopes of remaking and improving the discontinued Smith & Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the SD did not include. The Smith & Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or in the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)
SW1911 Series[edit]

Main article: Smith & Wesson SW1911
In 2003, Smith & Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911's well known dimensions, operation, and feel, while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high "beaver-tail" grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminum frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered "custom", with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.
Smith & Wesson's Performance Center produces the top of the line hand fitted competition version knowns as the PC 1911. While most 1911s run around 38 to 39 ounces (1,100 to 1,100 g), the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately 41 ounces (1,200 g). The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.
Rifles and carbines[edit]
During the early years of WW2, Smith & Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government.[39]
In January 2006, Smith & Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&P15 and the M&P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith & Wesson name.[40] Currently Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&W company.
In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge.[41] In 2009, it released the M&P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.[42]
Smith & Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.
Submachine gun[edit]
In 1967 Smith & Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and HK MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustav M/45 submachine gun (Kulsprutepistol m/45 or Kpist m/45) which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the "Swedish K") and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made prior to 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the USA and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.[30]
Shotguns[edit]
Smith & Wesson bought patents and tooling for a 12 ga. shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916, 916T, and 916A.[43] The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels rupturing.[44] The 916 series was discontinued, then later replaced by the Models 3000, based on an improved Remington 870 design, and 1000 intended to compete with the popular Remington Model 1100; both were produced by Howa of Japan.[45] However, with the sale of the company to British Tomkins PLC, Smith & Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid'80s to return to their "core" market of handguns.
During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson released the S&W assault shotgun, which had full automatic capability.
In November 2006, S&W announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the Elite series and the 1000 series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. The 1000 series was discontinued in 2009. Along with the new shotguns, S&W debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer's chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns.[46]
Internal locking mechanism[edit]
Most Smith & Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. While the lock can simply be left disengaged, most gun enthusiasts prefer "pre-lock" guns.[47][48]
Smith & Wesson announced in March 2009 that it would begin phasing the internal lock out of its revolver lineup.[49] The company is now producing the model 442 and 642 without the internal lock.[citation needed]
Restraints[edit]
Smith & Wesson is a main manufacturer of high-quality restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). At the beginning, Smith & Wesson manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. By that time, Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith & Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them.[50] When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith & Wesson continiued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.[51]
Smith & Wesson restraints are, depending on the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock as well as a push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.[52]
Handcuffs[edit]

Model 100 chain-linked handcuffs
Model 110 oversized handcuffs: these handcuffs are basically leg irons connected by a two links of chain.[53]
Model 300 hinged handcuffs
Model 1 universal handcuffs, available in a chain linked and a hinged version: these handcuffs are elliptical in shape and open 25% larger for big wrists and close 25% smaller for thin wrists.[54]

Leg irons[edit]

Model 1900 leg irons: these are leg irons with 14"" high-security heat-treated chain and larger dimension, elliptically contoured satin nickel cuffs. Due to the elliptical shape, they fit better to the ankles than leg irons with a round shape, therefore limiting the pressure on the Achilles heel.
Model 110 oversized handcuffs can also be used as very restrictive leg irons.[53]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
