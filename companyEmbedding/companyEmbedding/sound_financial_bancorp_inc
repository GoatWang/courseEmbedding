OLYMPIA and BELLEVUE, Wash., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage Financial Corporation ("Heritage") (NASDAQ:    HFWA) and Puget Sound Bancorp, Inc. ("Puget Sound") (OTCQB: PUGB) jointly announced today the signing of a definitive agreement under which Heritage will acquire Puget Sound in an all stock transaction valued at approximately $126.1 million, or $35.84 per share, based on the closing price of Heritage common stock of $27.15 on July 26, 2017.








Puget Sound, established in 2005, is a business bank headquartered in downtown Bellevue, Washington with one branch location and $567 million in total assets, $371 million in total loans and $505 million in total deposits as of June 30, 2017. Puget Sound focuses on business customers with 44% non-interest bearing deposits and 59% of its loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans (owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial & industrial loans). On a combined basis, Heritage will have total assets of approximately $4.6 billion, total loans in excess of $3.1 billion and total deposits of approximately $3.8 billion. 
"I am pleased to announce that Puget Sound has agreed to join with Heritage and create a stronger combined business banking platform in the Seattle-Bellevue market," said Brian Vance, President and Chief Executive Officer of Heritage Financial Corporation. "Puget Sound is a premier banking institution which has focused on serving the needs of small and medium sized businesses in the vibrant Seattle- Bellevue economy." Mr. Vance continued, "This acquisition adds to our momentum in the Seattle-Bellevue marketplace. Further, we welcome the employees and customers of Puget Sound into Heritage, and we look forward to our combined success going forward." 
Jim Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer of Puget Sound, added, "We are very happy to join Heritage and believe this combination will provide significant value to our shareholders, clients and employees. We also believe this is a natural fit which increases lending capabilities, expands capital resources and provides a more expansive product offering to the Seattle-Bellevue business community."
Jeff Deuel, President & Chief Operating Officer of Heritage Bank, added, "We have followed Puget Sound's success for several years and recognize the outstanding culture and valuable banking organization their team has created. Seattle-Bellevue is one of the strongest economies in the nation, and the combination of Heritage and Puget Sound will provide us with the operational scale to take advantage of significant growth opportunities. On a combined basis, our branches in Seattle and Bellevue will have approximately $846 million in total loans and $589 million in deposits."
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Puget Sound shareholders will receive 1.320 shares of Heritage common stock for each share of Puget Sound common stock, subject to potential adjustment. Based on the closing price of Heritage common stock of $27.15 on July 26, 2017, the consideration value per share for Puget Sound was $35.84, or approximately $126.1 million in the aggregate, including the value of restricted stock.  The value of the merger consideration will fluctuate until closing based on the value of Heritage's stock price and may be adjusted by a cap and collar in certain circumstances. Upon consummation, the shareholders of Puget Sound will own approximately 13.4% of the combined company. 
The definitive agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Heritage and Puget Sound. The merger is subject to regulatory approvals, approval by Puget Sound shareholders, and certain other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. 
D.A. Davidson & Co. served as financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to Heritage's board, and Breyer & Associates PC and Silver, Freedman, Taff & Tiernan, LLP served as legal counsel to Heritage. Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. served as financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to Puget Sound, and Keller Rohrback L.L.P. served as legal counsel to Puget Sound.

Heritage will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, July 27, 2017. Interested parties are invited to listen in by dialing (800) 553-0358.

Sound Financial Bancorp, Inc. Reports Net Income Of $1.4 Million In The First Quarter Of 2017, Or $0.54 Per Share






GlobeNewswire



Apr 27, 2017 5:57 PM EDT













 


















































 SEATTLE, April 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sound Financial Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:SFBC), the holding company (the "Company") for Sound Community Bank (the "Bank"), today reported net income of $1.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, or $0.54 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $1.1 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.43, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.   "The first quarter is typically our slowest quarter for loan originations. Increased residential loan rates also had a dampening effect on mortgage originations in the first quarter.  However, the continuing excellent credit environment again produced a net recovery in the quarter," stated Sound Community Bank and Sound Financial Bancorp, Inc. President and CEO Laurie Stewart. "Deposit growth was also robust allowing us to reduce our reliance on borrowings.  These factors contributed to results that were better than the first quarter of 2016 and are reflective of the strong local economy," concluded Ms. Stewart. The Company also announced today that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend on Company common stock of $0.10 per share, payable on May 26, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 12, 2017.  Highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 include:  Net interest income decreased by $107,000, or 1.8%, to $5.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $5.9 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and increased $446,000, or 8.3%, from $5.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Gain on sale of loans decreased by $167,000, or 49.4%, to $171,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $338,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and also declined $39,000, or 18.6% from $210,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no provision for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $204,000 and $150,000 for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Net recoveries for the first quarter of 2017 were $16,000 compared to net charge-offs of $241,000 for the fourth quarter in 2016 and $77,000 for the first quarter in 2016. Net loans (excluding loans held for sale) decreased 2.2% to $484.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $495.2 million at December 31, 2016 and increased 5.8% from $457.7 million at March 31, 2016. Deposits increased 2.8% to $480.8 million at March 31, 2017, from $467.7 million at December 31, 2016 and increased 7.3% from $448.1 million at March 31, 2016. The net interest margin ("NIM") was 4.28% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 4.35% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 4.27% for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Return on average assets was 0.98% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 1.09% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 0.83% for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Return on average equity was 9.23% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 10.50% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 7.98% for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Both the Company and Bank continue to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory requirements and the Bank continued to be categorized as "well-capitalized" at March 31, 2017.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
