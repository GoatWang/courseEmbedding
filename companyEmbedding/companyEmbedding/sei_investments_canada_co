See your investments through a new lens


Goals first, financials second. On the
    surface, that seems obvious. But if
    you're like other wealthy individuals,
    you might be surprised at the gap
    between your goals and the wealth
    you've set aside to attain them. Having
    clearly defined goals is what anchors
    your investment decisions. Combine
    that with advice focused on achieving
    your desired outcomes, and you have
    the most complete picture of
    your wealth possible - and all the
    confidence that goes with it.




Manage your life not a benchmark
Align investment strategies to goals
Learn from a network of your peers




Answer the essential questions
This isn't about risk/return objectives - that's math. This is about identifying and articulating what you want, and how that matches (or doesn't) the wants of your family members. What's keeping you up at night may be what's keeping you from making decisions. When you're able get to the heart of what matters, you begin to understand how your answers impact your family, your community, and you.


Initiate a plan to get it done.


Your personal success is not defined
        by a portfolio or its benchmarks —
        it is defined by your ability to
        align your interests to your goals.
        We help you consider your wealth in the
        context of your life, then tether it to
        quantitative data — things like cash flow,
        assets, and liabilities. This approach brings
        organization, clarity and confidence
        to your decision-making. You know
        what success looks like because you've
        created a goals-based framework that
        structures your assets around your life.
        






Measure what's important
What you don't measure never gets done. Concise, customized, contextual reporting for each of your goals is critical to keep you on track and making the right decisions. It's the only way to make effective, impactful decisions around your wealth. Our tailored reporting aggregates your financials, and business and non-liquid assets, and aligns them to your goals — giving you the most informed view of progress towards your goals available anywhere.

                                            Cultivating a healthy and happy team of brokers brimming with enthusiasm is an admirable goal. But are we trying to achieve the impossible?

                                            In a world where motivating others is just one inspirational Instagram meme away, it can be easy to skirt the surface of what it really takes to embody true leadership

Stock investors often hear about “sell in May and go away” around this time of year. It implies that investors should sell their stocks in early May and buy them back in late October at a lower price

SEI headquarters in Oaks, PA.


SEI Investments Company, formerly Simulated Environments Inc, is a financial services company headquartered in Oaks, Pennsylvania, United States. The company describes itself as "a global provider of investment processing, investment management, and investment operations solutions".[1] SEI provides products and services to institutions, private banks, investment advisors, investment managers, and private clients.[2] SEI manages, advises or administers $779 billion in hedge funds, private equity, mutual funds and other managed assets. This includes $297 billion in assets under management and $478 billion in client assets under administration.[1]
SEI has corporate headquarters in Oaks, Pennsylvania with offices in Toronto, London, Dublin, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, South Africa, and Dubai.[3]
History[edit]
SEI was founded as Simulated Environments Inc in 1968 by its current Chairman and CEO, Alfred P. West, Jr. (also known as Al West). West had created the first computer-simulated training technology for loan officers.[citation needed] In the 1970s SEI developed an automated trust and investment accounting system for bank trust departments. In the 1990s SEI launched a wealth management operating platform for independent, fee-based investment advisors.[citation needed]
In 2012 SEI was sued by investors in connection with the financial crimes committed by Allen Stanford. Stanford had sold investors bogus Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and the investors alleged that SEI, as well as other companies, had promoted and misrepresented the CDs as safe investments without performing appropriate due diligence.[4][5] SEI responded that it merely provided a Stanford affiliate with back office services.[6] As of September 2015 the case was still ongoing.[5]

Article

In this next installment, we  discuss  K&Ts  research  of human decision-making processes which are distorted by inherent biases toward optimism and overconfidence.

In Behavioural Finance: An Introduction to Human Error, we noted that Kahneman and Tversky were smart academics who found many ideas for their social science experiments in the mistakes that they themselves made as well as the mistakes that their intelligent colleagues and subjects made. Kahneman and Tversky noted some rules of thumb that often lead investors astray.
