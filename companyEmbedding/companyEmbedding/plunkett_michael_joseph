JOSEPH MARY PLUNKETT, who was born into a wealthy Dublin family in 1887, was a recognised poet, editor of The Irish Review and co-founder of the Irish Theatre. He was also one of the leaders of the 1916 Rising, the designer of the military plan and the youngest signatory of the Proclamation; he joined the IRB, negotiated arms from the German Government and travelled to New York to brief Irish America on the plans for the Rising. By Easter 1916 he was already dying of TB when, aged twenty-eight, he married Grace Gifford in Kilmainham Gaol, just hours before he was executed on 4 May 1916.
Drawing on family archives and Plunkett’s personal writings and letters, this is a fascinating, intimate account.
