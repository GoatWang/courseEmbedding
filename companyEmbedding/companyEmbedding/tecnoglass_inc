En 75 días, construida nueva estación de Bomberos Tecnoglass – Las Flores

30 Diciembre, 2016Categoria Principaladmin 


Con la plena financiación de la compañía Tecnoglass se encuentra lista para entrar en servicio la nueva estación de Bomberos en el sector de la Circunvalar con la Vía 40.
La obra fue ejecutada en un tiempo récord, teniendo como fecha de inicio el 11 de octubre cuando fue colocada la primera piedra con ocasión del partido Colombia vs Uruguay por las Eliminatorias del Mundial Rusia 2018.
Básicamente se trata de una estructura metálica, de dos pisos, con un garaje con las medidas apropiadas para el ingreso de dos máquinas de Bomberos proyectadas para la estación.
Además, cuenta con sala de capacitación, puesto de guardia, área de enfermería y oficinas para el oficial de turno, según precisó Luis Marenco, Ingeniero a cargo de la obra.
También está dotada de servicios accesorios para brigadas de Bomberos, 3 habitaciones, salas de ejercicio y de estar, pisos antideslizantes e iluminación LED.
La obra, construida en un área de 700 metros cuadrados, fue ejecutada por la firma A Construir y la ventaneria y vidrios producidas por Energía Solar y Tecnoglass.
La inversión inicial era de $1.600 millones. Sin embargo, se hizo una adición de $400 millones para entregar la estación completamente dotada: equipos de autocontenido, cizallas especiales para intervención en vehículos, planta de conmutador y todo el amoblamiento de dormitorios. Todo ello financiado por Tecnoglass.
La estación será inaugurada en el mes de enero, como un aporte de la empresa privada a la ciudad, en este caso Tecnoglass, para facilitar y permitir un desplazamiento más rápido para la atención de emergencias especialmente en los corredores industriales de la Circunvalar y la Vía 40.
“Tan solo han pasado 75 días desde la primera piedra y ya estamos listos, Alejandro Char. ¿Y ahora cuál es la próxima obra? Oigo sugerencias”, resaltó Christian Daes, presidente de Tecnoglass, para significar que continuará apoyando obras de beneficio general en Barranquilla.

Overview
Tecnoglass insulating glass saves energy in any home or nonresidential building  by improving the thermal performance of windows. It creates a more comfortable indoor environment free from extreme temperatures, and can reduce heating and cooling costs significantly.
Insulating glass is ideal for buildings that require efficient climate control. Inherently, insulating glass improves a window’s thermal performance by using an air space between two or more lites of glass to reduce the heat gain or loss. The result is windows and doors that are more energy efficient and buildings that are more cost effective. This type of glass can also reduce noise transmission.  
Our insulating glass units are double sealed, using a primary polyisobutylene seal and a secondary silicone seal. To ensure the sealed space remains dry throughout the unit’s lifetime, the glass lites are separated by a desiccant-filled spacer. The desiccant absorbs any internal moisture in the insulating glass unit.
Curved, laminated, silk-screened and spandrel glass can all be insulated following this same process. We can provide most any combination of finishes or properties needed by the customer.

Tecnoglass offers multiple configurations of insulating glass units:


  Components
 When specifying insulating glass, it is important to select and clearly outline the configuration as well as each individual component of the insulating glass unit.

The information contained herein is exclusive property of Tecnoglass, who reserves the right to modify it, including but not limited to the designs and its specifications, without notice.

The Power of Quality



 






As an industry leader we follow one vision: quality.
Since 1984 we have been improving our glass and windows’ optical quality, strength and durability. Our brands—Tecnoglass, ESWindows and Alutions—are fully integrated in a 2.6 million-square-foot facility, allowing us to offer single-source responsibility on all of our products. Today we employ over 4,000 people, we sell to 27 countries and we offer the latest technology on glass, aluminum frames and window systems.
Tecnoglass is the destination for customers who want high-quality glass that meets custom needs, is offered at competitive prices and comes with timely delivery. Our record-breaking technology has made us a one-stop-shop for all glass needs, including tempered, laminated and insulating glass, as well as glass with screen printing, impact-resistant glazing and curved glass.
We want to help make your vision a reality. That’s why we combine our selection of pioneering architectural glazing with one-on-one guidance from our industry and project experts. We strive to fulfill our customers’ quality and service expectations while maintaining our competitiveness through empowerment … and this is what makes us unique.
It is not only about the glass, but also about what it can transform into.

Vision
Our vision is to be a worldwide leader with the highest quality products and service, supported by highly trained and motivated employees who embody our mission.

Mission
Our mission is the transformation of glass using superior manufacturing technology . We also strive to fulfill our customers’ quality and service expectations while maintaining our competitiveness through empowerment . This contributes to our company’s growth and prosperity, while adequately and fairly compensating the members of our organization, their families, our stockholders and society.
History
Tecnoglass S.A. began operations on April 18, 1994 when it entered the early phases of large-scale production of tempered, laminated, insulating, screen-printed, bullet-resistant and curved glass. Over the years, Tecnoglass has gained industry recognition and prowess through its ability to respond to market demand for high quality products, competitive prices and timely delivery. Tecnoglass was established after sister company ESWINDOWS created a demand for more sophisticated and unconventional glass in its windows and facade projects.
For specialty needs, ranging from facades to refrigeration units among others, Tecnoglass offers customers a wide range of solutions. For example, its thermo-acoustic glass is ideal for large spaces that require temperature control and/or noise reduction, and laminated glass that exceeds market quality standards. Tecnoglass has proven a commitment to accommodating its customers’ needs. It is this commitment that has made the company the top supplier in South Florida, an area notorious for its strict construction requirements.
In December 2013, Tecnoglass Inc. debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange (NASDAQ: TGLS), accomplishing a great personal milestone as well as a milestone as the first Colombian company to be listed in NASDAQ, a globally recognized premier prestigious securities market. On January 6, 2016 the company also ventured in the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC), listing its shares under the mnemonic TGLSC. 
In 2015, Tecnoglass began offering clients TecnoAir solutions processed on its revolutionary, cutting-edge technology for glass tempering. By replacing the traditional roller-based equipment for an air-pressure system, TecnoAir completely eliminates distortion and iridescence, and enables the production of the world's thinnest security glass.
That same year, Tecnoglass launched TecnoBend, a curved glass featuring tempered Low-E level in large dimensions. TecnoBend is such a powerful new technology launched in response to today’s latest design trends and allowing for greater creative possibilities.













Meeting the Demand for Better Quality
Strategically located on the northern coast of South America on the Colombian Caribbean sea, the Tecnoglass group (Tecnoglass, Alutions and ESWindows) is fully integrated and controls the manufacturing process from beginning to end. As a result, we can guarantee to our customers in the Americas and locations around the world the best quality and superb service at fair prices. We don’t perform random quality control on our products—we inspect every single item before it leaves our facility. That is the power of quality.



















Strong relationship with local communities. 
For several decades, we have committed resources to improve the quality of life of our employees and the local communities surrounding our company’s facilities. As a result of these initiatives, we have developed close and cooperative relationships with local communities in Colombia, which are supported by several social responsibility initiatives we have undertaken. We consider our employees as the key motors of our historical and future success and therefore have focused initiatives of our non-profit, the Tecnoglass-ESWindows Foundation on offering our employees and their families the resources to purchase or improve their homes through the Programa de Mejora de Vivienda; as well as educational stipends for higher education pursuits through our program, Programa de Becas. The Tecnoglass-ESWindows Foundation supports a school for primary and secondary education in La Paz neighborhood in Barranquilla, Colombia. We work through alliances with other non-profits in different projects, such as Colombia: Una Campo para Soñar y Crecer that supports children in vulnerable neighborhoods in Barranquilla and its surrounding communities through the enhancement of their sports skills. In 2015, the Foundation in alliance with other non-profit organizations, opened the first orphans home in Barranquilla, named Internado Monseñor Victor Tamayo.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
