Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Hepatitis drugs more affordable but disease still deadly - WHO
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    11:00 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Prices of drugs to cure hepatitis C and to treat hepatitis B are dropping dramatically, offering affordability and hope to 325 million people living with the viral liver disease that can be fatal, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday. A generic antiviral drug for hepatitis C, which can be cured in three months, was placed this week on WHO's list of pre-qualified medicines.

















                                                    AstraZeneca Shocker Reminds Investors Miracle Drugs Are No Remedy for Risk
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    10:12 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Chasing exciting new developments in medicine can be a very expensive endeavor for investors. Such is the takeaway from AstraZeneca (AZN)' s stunning announcement Thursday morning that a hotly anticipated clinical trial didn't meet expectations. The company's combination of new cancer drugs failed to shrink tumors any more effectively than chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer.

















                                                    Bristol-Myers shares slump after failed AstraZeneca drug trial
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    8:36 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) shares fell 4 percent on Thursday as investors bet that a failed cancer-drug trial at AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) would have negative implications for Bristol-Myers' similar immunotherapy treatment regimen. AstraZeneca's Mystic study, released Thursday, looked at a combination of immune system-boosting drugs to treat non-small cell lung cancer.

















                                                    AstraZeneca shares plummet 16% on late-stage trial failure; Bristol-Myers shares fall 6% and Merck shares rise 5%
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    8:07 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) shares plummeted as much as 16% in premarket trade Thursday after the company said its cancer drug combination failed to meet its primary endpoint in a late-stage clinical trial. In the AstraZeneca (AZN) late-stage trial, the combination of the drugs Imfinzi and tremelimumab-- intended for previously-untreated patients with metastatic first-line non-small cell lung cancer-- did not improve progression-free survival compared to the standard of care.

















                                                    Bristol-Myers reports Q2 profit match, revenue beat
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    7:22 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) reported a second-quarter profit match and revenue beat on Thursday, but shares plummeted 6.2% in premarket trade on news of rival AstraZeneca's (AZN) late-stage clinical trial failure, which could carry implication for Bristol-Myers' own cancer drug combination. Earnings for the latest quarter declined to $916 million, or 56 cents per share, from $1.17 billion, or 69 cents per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings- per-share were 74 cents,...
