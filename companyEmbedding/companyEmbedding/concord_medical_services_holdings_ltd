What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Home>About Us>CCM Group Overview


The Company

Concord Medical Services Holdings Limited ("CCM" or "the Company") operates China's largest network in terms of revenue and total number of centers in operation. Since its inception CCM has been committed to building an extensive network of radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging centers in China and employing state-of-the art medical technology to sustain lives and reduce sufferings. Today, the Company operates a network of more than 141 centers with 81 hospitals spanning more than 56 cities and 25 provinces and administrative regions in China.CCM partners with hospitals to build radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging centers. Each center is typically equipped with a primary unit of advanced radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging equipment, such as linear accelerators, head gamma knife systems, body gamma knife systems, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scanners or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. The Company provides clinical support services to doctors working in the centers in its network, such as organizing joint diagnosis among doctors in its network and clinical research, while its hospital partners are responsible for the centers' clinical activities, doctors' medical decisions and the employment of the doctors.To further enhance its reputation and to employ high quality doctors, the Company plans to establish and operate specialty cancer hospitals in China. Its first specialty cancer hospital, the Chang'an CCM International Cancer Center, in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, has been operational since early 2010. The Company is also in the process of establishing the Beijing Proton Medical Center, which is expected to commence operations in 2015. Cancer was the leading cause of death in China in 2013, yet there is a relatively low penetration rate of radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging equipment compared to developed countries. According to Frost & Sullivan, the radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging market in China is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.4% between 2008 and 2015. Growth drivers include increasing cancer rates in China, growing awareness among physicians and patients, and hospitals' adoption of advanced radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging technologies. Furthermore, rising household disposable income and government healthcare expenditures will increase the affordability of such cancer treatment and diagnosistechnologies.With its leading network and its experience and expertise, the Company is uniquely positioned to address the underserved radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging services market in China.
