Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.05. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. Our use of net proceeds is listed in
the order of priority in which we intend to use them. There is no assurance that
we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we
will receive any proceeds from the offering.

                                   If 25%          If 50%         If 75%         If 100%

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,500 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Stanislav Pak, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Pak’s verbal agreement to provide us
loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Pak will
not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering.
There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Pak. Mr. Pak
will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate substantial
revenues to pay the obligation.


The level of competition in tourism is extremely high. We need proceeds from
this offering to enter this business. We will be in a market where we compete
with many domestic and international companies offering similar services. We
will be in direct competition with them. Many of these companies may have a
greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to
such companies. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market
entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these
existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Temir Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to
date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many participants in
the tourism industry. Many established, yet well financed entities are currently
active in tourism. Nearly all Temir Corp.'s competitors have significantly
greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities
than Temir Corp. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being
able to provide such services and become a successful company. Therefore, Temir
Corp. may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 19, 2016. We are development
stage company and commence operations in tourism. We plan to develop a website
that will display a variety of travel tours we plan to offer in Kyrgyzstan, and
will advertise our services and tours. 

Temir Corp. is a


 travel agency that organizes individual and group tours in
Kyrgyzstan, such as cultural, recreational, sport, business, ecotours and other
travel tours. Services and products provided by our company will include custom
packages according to the client’s specifications. We plan to develop and offer
our own tours in Kyrgyzstan as well as third-party suppliers.

Kyrgyzstan is a rugged Central Asian country along the Silk Road, the ancient
trade route between China and the Mediterranean. It is a landlocked country
in Central Asia, bordering Kazakhstan, China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It is
farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow
into closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea. The mountainous region
of the Tian Shan covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally
referred to as "the Switzerland of Central Asia", as a result), with the
remainder made up of valleys and basins. Kyrgyz Republic is an amazingly
beautiful country, enclosed by very popular mountain ranges, glaciers and lakes
of the world. The country's culture is most adorably painted in the colors of
the nation's nomadic heritage that has been carried on from generation to
generation and is existing. Temir Corp. intends to organize and sell tours in
the fields of:

Cultural Tourism

Kyrgyz culture is based on nomadic traditions that harkens back to the days of
the Mongol hordes. Although modern Kyrgyz people live mainly in houses or
apartment buildings, in the summer time it is still possible to observe the
native people living in a yurt with their herds of sheep, goats, horses, and
occasionally even yaks. There are a number of yurt camps that cater to tourists.
Located on the Great Silk Road Kyrgyzstan has always been a crossroads of trade
and cultural exchanges between China, Iran, India and the Arabian Sea and has
become home for more than 80 nationalities and ethnic communities. As a
multinational state Kyrgyzstan has a rich variety of languages, literature,
folklore, arts, crafts, customs and communities that lend color and variety to
Kyrgyz culture.

Recreational tourism

Over 90% of Kyrgyzstan lies above 1,500 m with unspoiled countryside and the
primordial beauty of towering mountains, which give Kyrgyzstan more than 28
thousand rivulets, sparkling streams and crystal clear brooks. There are 1,923
large and small lakes in the Republic but the largest and best known is
Issyk-Kul Lake. 

Ecotourism

Kyrgyzstan is one of the last few unpolluted places on our planet that along
with its beautiful alpine scenery has preserved its nomadic traditions, rich
heritage and cultural continuity that date back many thousands of years. The
ecological wealth and diversity and the cultural heritage of Kyrgyzstan are
suited to understanding man's relationship with nature.

Business Tourism

Kyrgyzstan has number of good hotels with all necessary facilities and comfort
in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, and the Issyk-Kul region, where conferences,
presentations etc. can be organized. 

Sport Tourism

It includes an active tourism like the high-altitude ascents to the 7 thousand
summits, climbing, biking tours along the crystal clear mountain lake Issyk-Kul,
motor-tours, horseback-riding through the high passes and Alpine meadows, riding
across virgin natural landscapes of Tien-Shan high mountainous area covered with
edelweiss's, primulas, high mountainous roses and tulips. There is also wide
range of other activities such as trekking, rafting, hiking, horseback riding,
fishing, camping, skiing and other.

Caving Tourism

Kyrgyzstan is rich in caves and grottos scattered throughout the Republic, many
of which are easily accessible and they attract a number of speleologist,
potholers or cavers, but unlike in other parts of the world, they have not yet
been developed as tourist attractions.

Ornithological Tourism

There are 335 species of birds in Kyrgyzstan, which makes it a must for
ornithological tours.

Biological Tourism

There are 4,000 species of high-altitude vegetation, 500 species of animals, 335
species of birds, 25 species of reptiles, 49 species of fish and 3 species of
frogs in Kyrgyzstan, which makes it a real paradise for biological tours.

According to World Development Indicators (https://knoema.com), the number of
international inbound tourists to Kyrgyzstan in 2014 was 2,849,000.
International inbound tourists (overnight visitors) are the number of tourists
who travel to a country other than that in which they have their usual
residence, but outside their usual environment, for a period not exceeding 12
months and whose main purpose in visiting is other than an activity remunerated
from within the country visited. Tourism is considered to be one of the most
promising industries in Kyrgyzstan, and the Kyrgyz government has identified
tourism as a priority sector for its development program.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING
	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into
	this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus contain statements that are not based on historical facts, including statements or information with words such as may, will, could, should,
	plans, intends, expects, believes, estimates, anticipates, continues, and other similar words. These statements constitute forward-looking statements within the
	meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In
	particular, the risk factors included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus describe forward-looking information. The risk factors contained herein, on page 3 of the accompanying prospectus
	and in our Annual Report on

	Form 10-K for

	the year ended December 31, 2015 that we filed with the SEC on February 9, 2016, describe risks that may affect these statements but are not
	exhaustive, particularly with respect to possible future events. Many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. These factors include, but are not limited to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	risks that our tenants may not pay rent, may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy, or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopment or renovation projects that
	we do pursue may cost more, take more time to complete or fail to perform as expected;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risk that we are investing a significant amount in ground-up development projects that may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects, requires spending a substantial amount upfront in
	infrastructure, and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded;




	 


	ii






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that:




	 




	 


	


	 


	occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected,




	 




	 


	


	 


	new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected,




	 




	 


	


	 


	competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions,




	 




	 


	


	 


	environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and




	 




	 


	


	 


	because real estate is illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks associated with general economic conditions, including local economic conditions in our geographic markets;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks of financing, such as our ability to consummate additional financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations
	imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a REIT, the
	effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT.




	Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or those included in or incorporated by
	reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. We also make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements, or to publicly release the results if we revise any of them.

	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY




	The following is only a summary. It should be read together with the more detailed information included elsewhere in this prospectus supplement and the
	accompanying prospectus. In addition, important information is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.




	The Trust



	We are an equity real estate
	investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan
	markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as in California and South Florida. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use
	properties which are operated as 90 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 21.4 million square feet. In total, the real estate projects were 94.3% leased and 93.5% occupied at December 31, 2015. A joint venture
	in which we owned a 30% interest owned six retail real estate projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet as of December 31, 2015. In total, the joint venture properties in which we owned an interest were 93.6% leased and 85.3%
	occupied at December 31, 2015. On January 13, 2016, we acquired our partners 70% interest in the joint venture and subsequently own 100% of the related properties. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously
	since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 48 consecutive years.


	We were founded in 1962 as a REIT under the laws
	of the District of Columbia and re-formed as a REIT in the state of Maryland in 1999. We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes pursuant to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
	Code). Our principal executive offices are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Our telephone number is (301) 998-8100. Our website address is www.federalrealty.com. The information contained on our
	website is not a part of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus and is not incorporated herein or therein by reference.

	Investing in our common shares involves risks. Please review the risk factors discussed on page S-3 of this prospectus supplement, on page 3 of the accompanying prospectus and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
	December 31, 2015 that we filed with the SEC on February 9, 2016, and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus for a discussion of factors you should
	consider before deciding to invest in our common shares. You may obtain a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus by following the

	RISK FACTORS




	Investing in our common shares involves a significant degree of risk. Before you decide to purchase our common shares, you should carefully consider the
	following risk factors, together with all of the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, including the additional risk factors discussed on page 3 of the accompanying prospectus and in our Annual
	Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that we filed with the SEC on February 9, 2016. The risks and uncertainties we have described are those we believe to be the principal risks that could affect us, our business or our
	industry, and which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation or the market price of our securities. However, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
	immaterial may affect our business operations and the market price of our securities.




	You may experience significant dilution as a result of this
	offering and additional issuances of our securities, including our common shares, which could harm the market price of our common shares



	Our
	declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to authorize, without shareholder approval, the issuance of additional common or preferred shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities. We may, from time to time and at
	any time, seek to offer and sell additional common or preferred shares or other securities, based on market conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control.


	This offering may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share and funds from operations per share after giving effect to the issuance of our common
	shares in this offering and the receipt of the expected net proceeds. The actual amount of dilution from this offering, or from any future offering of common or preferred shares, will be based on numerous factors, particularly the use of proceeds
	and the return generated by such investment, and cannot be determined at this time. The market price of our common shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our common shares in the market pursuant to this or future offerings,
	or other factors, or as a result of the perception or expectation that such sales or other factors could occur.



	Holders of our debt or preferred
	shares have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares, and any future issuance of debt or preferred shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.



	As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.6 billion of debt outstanding, and 399,896 shares of our 5.417% Series 1 Cumulative Convertible
	Preferred Shares, or the Series 1 Preferred Shares, were issued and outstanding. Holders of our debt and preferred shares have liquidation rights and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares. Upon any voluntary
	or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, payment will be made to holders of our debt and preferred shares, including our Series 1 Preferred Shares, before any payment is made to the holders of our common shares. This will reduce the
	amount of our assets, if any, available for distribution to holders of our common shares. Because our decision to issue debt and preferred shares is dependent on market conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control, we cannot predict
	or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future issuances. Any such future issuance could reduce the market price of our common shares.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	The net proceeds to us from the sale of the common shares offered by this prospectus supplement are estimated to be approximately $149.3 million after
	deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated expenses of this offering payable by us (approximately $171.7 million if the underwriter exercises its option to purchase additional shares in full). We intend to use these net proceeds to
	reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.


	Our $600 million revolving credit facility bears
	interest at LIBOR plus 90 basis points and matures on April 21, 2017, subject to a one-year extension at our option. As of February 29, 2016, we had $231.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility. An affiliate of the
	underwriter is a lender under our revolving credit facility and will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering that are used to repay amounts outstanding thereunder.

	UNDERWRITING (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)



	We intend to offer the common shares through the underwriter. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in an underwriting agreement and a related pricing
	agreement, each dated the date of this prospectus supplement, the underwriter has agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to the underwriter, 1,000,000 common shares.


	The common shares are offered by the underwriter, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by it, subject to approval of legal matters by
	counsel for the underwriter and certain other conditions. The underwriter reserves the right to withdraw, cancel or modify the offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.



	Commissions and Discounts



	The underwriter has agreed to
	purchase the common shares from us at a price of $149.43 per share, which will result in $149,430,000 of proceeds to us before expenses, or approximately $171,844,500 if the underwriters option to purchase additional shares described
	below is exercised in full. The underwriter may offer the common shares from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market
	prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. In connection with the sale of the common shares offered hereby, the underwriter may be deemed to have received compensation in the form of
	underwriting discounts. The underwriter may effect such transactions by selling common shares to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriter and/or
	purchasers of common shares for whom it may act as agent or to whom it may sell as principal.


	We estimate that the expenses of this offering payable by
	us, excluding the underwriting discount, will be approximately $150,000.



	Lock-up Agreements



	We, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have agreed that, for a period of 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, we and
	they will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of or hedge any of our common shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable, exchangeable or
	redeemable for our common shares. This lock-up agreement, however, will not prevent us from issuing or granting options to purchase:


	 




	 


	


	 


	common shares in this offering;




	 




	 


	

	common shares pursuant to any exercise of contractual rights that exist on the date of this prospectus supplement and that require or permit us to issue common shares to current or former holders of partnership or other
	interests in certain of our downREIT partnerships or other subsidiaries, including as a result of exercises of options granted pursuant to such rights; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	subject to certain conditions, common shares, preferred shares and any other of our securities, including securities convertible into or exercisable, exchangeable or redeemable for common shares, as consideration for
	the acquisition of real property.




	The lock-up agreements do not prohibit our chief executive officer or chief financial officer from
	exercising options (as long as they hold the common shares received from such exercises pursuant to the terms of the lock-up agreements) or purchasing common shares under employee or trustee benefit plans, from making gifts of common shares or
	securities convertible into or exercisable, exchangeable or redeemable for common shares for the benefit of their immediate families or for charitable purposes as long as the underwriter is provided three business days prior written notice and
	the donee enters into a similar lock-up agreement.


	Citigroup Global Markets Inc. may, in its sole discretion and at any time or from time to time,
	without notice, release us, our chief executive officer or our chief financial officer from the lock-up agreements.



	Option to Purchase Additional
	Shares



	We have granted an option to the underwriter to purchase up to an additional 150,000 common shares at a price of $149.43 per share, less any
	dividends or distributions payable on the shares initially purchased by the underwriter but not payable on such option shares. The underwriter may exercise this option for 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement. If any additional common
	shares are purchased, the underwriter will offer the additional common shares on the same terms as those on which the common shares are being offered.

	using a shelf registration process. Under this shelf process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in this prospectus either separately or in units, in one or more offerings. Our prospectus provides you with a general
	description of these securities. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about all of the terms of that offering. Our prospectus supplement may also add, update or change
	information contained in this prospectus. Before purchasing any securities, you should read both this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement and any applicable free writing prospectus, together with additional information described

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY




	The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information and consolidated financial statements
	and notes thereto contained elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus.




	The Trust



	We are an equity real estate investment trust, or REIT, specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail
	and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as in California. As of
	March 31, 2015, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 90 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 20.7 million square
	feet. In total, the real estate projects were 95.4% leased and 94.5% occupied at March 31, 2015. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned six retail real estate projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet as of
	March 31, 2015. In total, the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 85.8% leased and 85.4% occupied at March 31, 2015. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and
	have increased our dividends per common share for 47 consecutive years.


	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT
	pursuant to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.


	We were founded in 1962 as a REIT under the laws of
	the District of Columbia and re-formed as a real estate investment trust in the state of Maryland in 1999. Our principal executive offices are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Our telephone number is
	(301) 998-8100. Our website address is

	www.federalrealty.com

	The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. In computing the
	ratio of earnings to fixed charges: (a) earnings consist of income from continuing operations before income or loss from equity investees plus distributed income of equity investees and fixed charges (excluding capitalized interest) less
	noncontrolling interests of subsidiaries with no fixed charges; and (b) fixed charges consist of interest expense including amortization of debt premiums and discounts and issuance costs (including capitalized interest), prepayment charges and
	the estimated portion of rents payable by us representing interest.


	The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred share
	dividends is computed by dividing earnings by the total of fixed charges and preferred share dividends. In computing the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends: (a) earnings consist of income from continuing
	operations before income or loss from equity investees plus distributed income of equity investees and fixed charges (excluding capitalized interest) less noncontrolling interests of subsidiaries with no fixed charges; (b) fixed charges consist
	of interest expense including amortization of debt premiums and discounts and issuance costs (including capitalized interest), prepayment charges and the estimated portion of rents payable by us representing interest; and (c) preferred share
	dividends consist of preferred share dividends and preferred share redemption costs.

	RISK FACTORS



	Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, please consider the risks described

	included in this prospectus, in an applicable prospectus supplement and in any subsequent filing with the SEC that is incorporated herein by reference. The risks and uncertainties we have described are those we believe to be the principal risks that
	could affect us, our business or our industry, and which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation or the market price of our securities. However, additional risks and uncertainties not currently
	known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may affect our business operations and the market price of our securities.

	DESCRIPTION
	OF DEBT SECURITIES



	We will prepare and distribute a prospectus supplement that describes the specific terms of the debt securities.
	In this section of the prospectus, we describe the general terms we expect all debt securities to have. We also identify some of the specific terms that will be described in a prospectus supplement. Although we expect that any debt securities we
	offer with this prospectus will have the general terms we describe in this section, our debt securities may have terms that are different from or inconsistent with the general terms we describe here. Therefore, you should read the prospectus
	supplement carefully.

	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, debt securities we offer through this prospectus:


	 




	 


	


	 


	will be our general, direct and unsecured obligations; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	may be either senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities.




	Senior debt securities
	will rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior debt in the manner we describe in a prospectus
	supplement.


	We may incur additional debt, subject to limitations in the agreements governing our credit and other debt facilities and
	other notes we may have issued.


	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement:


	 




	 


	


	 


	debt securities we offer through this prospectus will not limit the amount of other debt that we may incur;




	 




	 


	


	 


	you will not have any protection if we engage in a highly leveraged transaction, a restructuring, a transaction involving a change in control, or a merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the
	debt securities; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will not list the debt securities on any securities exchange.





	The Indentures



	Any debt securities we offer through this prospectus will be issued under one or more indentures, including the senior indenture between us and
	U.S. Bank National Association, successor to Wachovia Bank National Association, formerly First Union National Bank, as trustee. We have filed with the SEC the senior indenture that is an exhibit to the registration statement that includes this
	prospectus. The senior indenture describes the general terms of senior debt securities we may issue. The general terms of any subordinated debt securities that we may issue will be included in a subordinated indenture, which will also include
	additional terms describing the subordination provisions of these securities. The senior indenture is subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.


	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, each indenture does not or will not include all the terms of debt securities we may issue
	through this prospectus. If we issue debt securities through this prospectus, our Board of Trustees, or any committee thereof, will establish the additional terms for each series of debt securities. The additional terms will be either established
	pursuant to, and set forth in, a supplemental indenture, or established pursuant to a resolution of our Board of Trustees, or any committee thereof, and set forth in an officers certificate. Each indenture describes or will describe the
	additional terms that may be established and we summarize the additional terms that may be established under  Additional Terms of Debt Securities, below.


	We have summarized the provisions of the senior indenture and any subordinated indenture that we may enter into below. The summary is not
	complete. You should read the senior indenture and any other indenture that we may enter into for provisions that may be important to you. The extent, if any, to which the provisions of the base senior indenture or any other base indenture that we
	may enter into apply to particular debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those securities. You should read the prospectus supplement for more information regarding any particular issuance of debt securities.

	Subordination





	Generally.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on
	subordinated debt securities will be subordinated, or junior, to the prior payment in full of all or any of our present and future senior debt. This means that we must pay all present and future senior debt before we pay amounts due to
	holders of subordinated debt securities if we liquidate, dissolve, reorganize or go through a similar process. After making these payments, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay the amounts due to holders of subordinated debt securities
	or equity securities.


	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, senior debt will be defined as the principal of and interest
	on, or substantially similar payments to be made by us in respect of, the following, whether outstanding at the date of execution of any subordinated indenture or thereafter incurred, created or assumed:

	indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of others in respect of which we are liable, contingently or otherwise, for payment or advances of money or property, or as guarantor, endorser or otherwise, or which we have
	agreed to purchase or otherwise acquire; and

	


	 


	any such indebtedness, obligation or liability of a type described or referred to in the bullets above as to which, in the instrument creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding, it is

	


	 


	any such indebtedness, obligation or liability which is subordinated to our indebtedness to substantially the same extent as or to a greater extent than the subordinated debt securities are subordinated to our

	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, there

	


	 


	purchase, redeem, defease, or otherwise acquire any subordinated debt securities.




	This
	prohibition will not affect any payment we have already made to defease debt securities, as described under  Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indentures, below.


	We must resume payment on our subordinated debt securities, and make any payments we have missed, when one of the following has occurred:

	the date that is 179 days after receipt of notice (unless we have previously been required to pay all amounts owing on the applicable senior debt);

	the date the default and all other similar defaults as to which notice has been given shall have been cured, waived or shall have ceased to exist;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the date the applicable senior debt (and all other senior debt as to which notice has been given) shall have been discharged or paid in full; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the date on which we or the trustee receives written notice from the representative of holders of senior debt or the holders of at least a majority of the senior debt terminating the blockage period.




	Any number of notices of non-payment defaults may be given, but during any 365-day consecutive period only one blockage period may commence,
	and the period may not exceed 179 days. No non-payment default with respect to senior debt that existed or was continuing on the date a blockage period for our subordinated debt securities commenced may be made the basis of another blockage period
	for those securities whether or not within a period of 365 consecutive days, unless at least 90 consecutive days have elapsed since the default was cured or waived.



	Default Provisions





	Events of
	Default.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, each of the following is an event of default as to any of our senior or subordinated debt securities:


	1. A default in the payment of any interest or any additional amounts on any debt security of that series or of any coupon appertaining
	thereto when it becomes due and payable, if the default continues for a period of 30 days.


	2. A default in the payment of the
	principal of (or premium, if any, on) any debt security of that series at its maturity (upon acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, required purchase or otherwise).


	3. A default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment as required by the terms of any debt security of that series.


	4. A default in the performance, or a breach, of any covenant or agreement by us under the applicable indenture (other than a default in
	the performance, or a breach of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clause (1) through (8) hereof) if such default or breach continues for a period of 60 days after written notice has been given, by
	registered or certified mail:


	(a) to us by the trustee; or


	(b) to us and the trustee by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series.


	5. The occurrence of one or more defaults under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed by us
	(including obligations under leases required to be capitalized on the balance sheet of the lessee under generally accepted accounting principles but not including any indebtedness or obligations for which recourse is limited to property purchased)
	in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25,000,000 or under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by us (including such leases
	but not including such indebtedness or obligations for which recourse is limited to property purchased) in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25,000,000, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, if the default has
	resulted in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable or in the acceleration of such obligations, without such acceleration having been rescinded or
	annulled.


	6. The entry by a court of competent jurisdiction under any applicable bankruptcy law that:


	(a) is for relief against us or any of our significant subsidiaries in an involuntary case,


	 


	10






	Table of Contents



	(b) appoints a receiver in respect of us or any of our significant subsidiaries or for all
	or substantially all of the property of any of us; or


	(c) orders our liquidation or the liquidation of any of our significant
	subsidiaries, and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days.


	7. We or any of our significant subsidiaries do
	any of the following:


	(a) commence a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy law;


	(b) consent to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of us or any of our significant subsidiaries in an involuntary case
	or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy law;


	(c) consent to the appointment of a receiver in respect of us or any of our
	significant subsidiaries for all or substantially all of our or its property; or


	(d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of
	our creditors or the creditors of any of our significant subsidiaries.


	8. Any other event of default provided with respect to the
	debt securities of that series.




	Waiver of Default.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, holders of not
	less than a majority of the debt securities of a series may waive any past default except for:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a payment default; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a default on any provision that requires the consent of all holders to modify.






	Acceleration of Payment.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, each indenture provides or will provide that
	if an event of default occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the applicable series outstanding may declare all unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued
	interest on, all the debt securities of the applicable series to be due and payable immediately by a notice given in writing to us (and to the trustee if given by the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series). The trustee may, then,
	at its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the holders of the applicable debt securities by appropriate judicial proceeding.




	Waiver of Acceleration.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, each indenture provides or will provide that,
	after a declaration of acceleration, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities, by written notice to us and the
	trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	we have paid, or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay:




	 




	 


	


	 


	all overdue interest and any additional amounts payable on all outstanding debt securities of the applicable series and any related coupons,




	 




	 


	


	 


	the principal of and premium, if any, on any debt securities of the applicable series which have become due other than by such declaration of acceleration, plus interest thereon at the rate borne by the debt securities,




	 




	 


	


	 


	to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the debt securities, and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all sums paid or advanced by the trustee under the indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the trustee, its agents and counsel; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all events of default, other than the non-payment of principal of the debt securities which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.






	Notices of Default.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we are required to deliver to the trustee, on or
	before a date not more than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate of compliance with the indenture, and, in the event of any noncompliance, specifying such noncompliance, including whether or not any default has occurred. The
	trustee is required to give notice to the holders of debt securities within 90 days of a default under the applicable indenture unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that the trustee may withhold notice to the
	holders of any series of debt securities of any default with respect to such series (except a default in the payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on or any additional amounts with respect to any debt security of such series
	or in the payment of any sinking fund installment in respect of any debt security of such series) if the trustee considers such withholding to be in the interest of the holders.

	Table of Contents





	Limitation on Suits.


	 Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, each
	indenture provides or will provide that no holders of debt securities of any series may institute any proceedings, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless the trustee has failed to act for a period of
	60 days after it has received a written request to institute proceedings in respect of an event of default from the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the applicable series outstanding together with
	an offer of indemnity from such holders that is reasonably satisfactory to the trustee and the trustee has received no direction inconsistent with such written request during such 60-day period from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
	amount of the debt securities of the applicable series outstanding. This provision will not prevent, however, any holder of debt securities from instituting suit for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest
	on such debt securities at the respective due dates of the securities.




	Obligations of Trustee.


	 Unless we say otherwise
	in a prospectus supplement, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the debt securities unless they shall have offered to the
	trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred thereby.


	The
	Trust Indenture Act limits the trustee, should it become a creditor of ours or of any guarantor, from obtaining payment of claims in certain cases or realizing certain property received by it in respect of those claims, as security or otherwise. The
	trustee is permitted to engage in certain other transactions as long as, if it acquires any conflicting interest and an event of default occurs, it either cures the conflict or resigns as trustee.


	For information regarding the acceleration of a portion of the principal amount of any original issue discount securities on the occurrence of
	an event of default, please read the prospectus supplement relating to the issuance of those securities.



	Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of
	Indenture



	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we will be able to discharge our obligations under debt securities at
	any time by taking the actions described below. The discharge of all obligations using this process is known as defeasance. If we defease debt securities, all obligations under the series of debt securities that is defeased will be
	deemed to have been discharged, except for:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the rights of holders of outstanding debt securities to receive, solely from funds deposited for this purpose, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on those debt securities when the
	payments are due;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the obligations with respect to the debt securities concerning issuing temporary debt securities, registration of debt securities, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities, and the maintenance of an office
	or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the defeasance provisions of the indenture.




	We will also be able to free ourselves from
	certain covenants that are described in an indenture by taking the actions described below. The discharge of obligations using this process is known as covenant defeasance. If we defease covenants under debt securities, then certain
	events (not including non-payment, enforceability of any guarantee, bankruptcy and insolvency events) described under  Events of Default will no longer constitute an event of default with respect to the debt securities.


	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, in order to exercise either defeasance or covenant defeasance as to the outstanding debt
	securities of a series:


	 




	 


	


	 



	we must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series, an amount in
	(i) currency, currencies or currency units in which those debt securities are then specified as payable at maturity, (ii) government obligations (as defined in the applicable indenture) or (iii) any combination thereof, as will be
	sufficient, without consideration of reinvestment of





	 


	12






	Table of Contents



	principal and interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the trustee, to pay and
	discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the debt securities of the applicable series on the stated maturity of such principal or installment of principal or interest and any mandatory sinking fund payments;


	 




	 


	


	 


	in the case of defeasance, we will deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel confirming that either:




	 




	 


	


	 


	we have received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or




	 




	 


	


	 


	since the date of execution of the indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law,




	the effect of either being that the holders of the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or
	loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;


	 




	 


	


	 


	in the case of covenant defeasance, we will deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
	income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;




	 




	 


	


	 


	no default, event of default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or insofar as clause 6 or 7 of
	 Default Provisions  Events of Default is concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which we are a party or by which we are
	bound;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will deliver to the trustee an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for that relate to either the defeasance or the covenant defeasance, as the
	case may be, have been met; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that either (i) as a result of the deposit pursuant to the first bullet in this paragraph and the election to defease, registration is not required
	under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, with respect to the trust funds representing the deposit, or (ii) all necessary registrations under the Investment Company Act have been effected.





	Modifications and Amendments



	Unless we
	say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we and the trustee may modify and amend either indenture with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series affected by the
	modification or amendment; provided, however, that no modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security of all series affected by the modification or amendment:


	 




	 


	


	 


	change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any debt security;




	 




	 


	


	 


	reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change any obligation of ours to pay additional amounts under the indenture, except as
	contemplated in the indenture, or reduce the amount of the principal of an original issue discount security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy;




	 




	 


	


	 


	adversely affect any right of repayment at the option of the holder of any series of outstanding debt security;




	 




	 


	


	 


	change the place of repayment where, or the currency, currency unit or composite currency in which, the principal or premium, if any, of any debt security or the interest thereon is payable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment after the stated maturity of the debt security (or in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);




	 


	13






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding debt securities of any series for which the consent of the holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or for any waiver of compliance with certain
	provisions of the indenture or certain defaults, or reduce the requirements for quorum or voting as provided in the indenture; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	modify any of the provisions that relate to supplemental indentures and that require the consent of holders, that relate to the waiver of past defaults, that relate to the waiver of certain covenants, except to increase
	the percentage in principal amount of outstanding debt securities required to take such actions or to provide that certain other provisions of the indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each debt security
	affected thereby.




	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we and the trustee may modify and amend either
	indenture without the consent of the holders if the modification or amendment does only the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	evidences the succession of another person to us and the assumption by any such successor of any covenants under the indenture and in the debt securities of any series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	adds to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of debt securities or surrenders any of our rights or powers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	adds any additional event of default for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	secures the debt securities of any series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	adds or changes any provisions to the extent necessary to provide that bearer securities may be registrable as to principal, to change or eliminate any restrictions on the payment of principal of or any premium or
	interest on bearer securities, to permit bearer securities to be issued in exchange for registered securities or bearer of securities of other authorized denominations, or to permit or facilitate the issuance of securities in uncertificated form,
	provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of outstanding debt securities in any material respect;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes or eliminates any provision affecting only debt securities not yet issued;




	 




	 


	


	 


	establishes the form or terms of debt securities of any series not yet issued;




	 




	 


	


	 


	evidences and provides for successor trustees or adds or changes any provisions of the indenture to the extent necessary to permit or facilitate the appointment of a separate trustee or trustees for specific series of
	debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	cures any ambiguity, corrects or supplements any provisions which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision, or makes any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the indenture
	which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the indenture; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment may adversely affect the interest of holders of debt securities of any series then outstanding in any material respect;
	or




	 




	 


	


	 


	supplements any provision of the indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit the facilitation of defeasance and discharge of any series of debt securities; provided, however, that any such action may not
	adversely affect the interest of holders of debt securities of any series then outstanding in any material respect.




	The
	holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of a series outstanding may waive compliance with certain restrictive covenants and provisions of either indenture with respect to that series.



	Original Issue Discount



	We may issue
	debt securities under either indenture for less than their stated principal amount. Such securities may be treated as original issue discount securities, and they may be subject to special tax consequences. In addition, some debt
	securities that are offered and sold at their stated principal amount may, under certain circumstances, be treated as issued at an original issue discount for federal income tax purposes. We will describe the federal income tax consequences and
	other special consequences applicable to securities treated as original issue discount securities in the prospectus supplement relating to such securities. Original issue discount security generally means any debt security that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	does not provide for the payment of interest prior to maturity; or




	 


	14






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	is issued at a price lower than its face value and provides that upon redemption or acceleration of its stated maturity an amount less than its principal amount shall become due and payable.





	Notices



	Unless we say otherwise in a
	prospectus supplement, we will send notices to holders of debt securities by mail to the holders address as it appears in the register.



	Governing Law



	Unless we say otherwise in
	a prospectus supplement, each indenture and the debt securities will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.












	DESCRIPTION OF SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST



	We are a Maryland REIT. Your
	rights as a shareholder are governed by the Code of Maryland, including Title 8 of the Corporations and Associations Article, or Maryland REIT Law, our declaration of trust, our bylaws and the articles supplementary with respect to our Series 1
	preferred shares. The following summary of the material terms, rights and preferences of the shares of beneficial interest is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the laws of the State of Maryland, including
	Maryland REIT law, our declaration of trust, bylaws and the articles supplementary with respect to our Series 1 preferred shares.



	Authorized Shares



	Our declaration of trust allows us to issue up to 100,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, and
	15,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share. As of May 4, 2015, we had issued and outstanding 68,682,443 common shares, and 399,896 preferred shares, which are designated as 5.417% Series 1 Cumulative
	Convertible Preferred Shares, which we refer to as the Series 1 preferred shares.




	Authority of the Board of Trustees Relating
	to Authorization and Classification of Shares.


	 Our declaration of trust allows our Board of Trustees to take the following actions without approval by you or any shareholder:


	 




	 


	


	 


	classify or reclassify any authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares into one or more classes or series of shares of beneficial interest;




	 




	 


	


	 


	amend the declaration of trust to change the total number of shares of beneficial interest authorized; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	amend the declaration of trust to change the authorized number of shares of any class or series of shares of beneficial interest.




	If there are any laws or stock exchange rules which require us to obtain shareholder approval in order for us to take these actions, however,
	we will contact you and other shareholders to solicit that approval.


	We believe that the power of the Board of Trustees to issue
	additional shares of beneficial interest will provide us with greater flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other future needs. Although the Board of Trustees does not currently intend to do so, it has
	the ability to issue a class or series of beneficial shares that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of our control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common shares or otherwise be favorable to them.



	Common Shares



	All common shares offered
	through this prospectus will be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. As a shareholder, you will be entitled to receive distributions, or dividends, on the shares you own if the Board of Trustees authorizes a dividend to the holders of our
	common shares out of our legally available assets. Your right to receive those dividends may be affected, however, by the preferential rights of the Series 1 preferred shares or any other class or series of shares of beneficial interest and the
	provisions of our declaration of trust regarding


	 


	15






	Table of Contents



	restrictions on the transfer of shares of beneficial interest. For example, you may not receive dividends if no funds are available for distribution after we pay dividends to holders of preferred
	shares. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common shares will be entitled to share pro rata in all of our assets remaining after payment or provision for all of our debts and other liabilities and preferential
	amounts owing in respect of our Series 1 preferred shares and any other shares of beneficial interest having a priority over our common shares in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As noted above under Authorized
	Shares, our outstanding Series 1 preferred shares rank prior to our common shares with respect to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.




	Voting Rights.


	Each outstanding common share owned by a shareholder entitles that holder to one vote on all matters submitted to
	a vote of common shareholders, including the election of trustees. The right to vote is subject to the provisions of our declaration of trust regarding the restriction of the transfer of shares of beneficial interest, which we describe under
	 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer, below. There is no cumulative voting in the election of trustees, which means that, under Maryland law and our bylaws, the holders of a plurality of all of the votes cast at a meeting
	of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present can elect a trustee. The holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any trustees.


	As a holder of a common share, you will not have any right to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	convert your shares into any other security;




	 




	 


	


	 


	have any funds set aside for future payments;




	 




	 


	


	 


	require us to repurchase your shares; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	purchase any of our securities, if other securities are offered for sale, other than as a member of the general public.




	Subject to the terms of our declaration of trust regarding the restrictions on transfer of shares of beneficial interest, each common share
	has the same dividend, distribution, liquidation and other rights as each other common share.


	According to the terms of our declaration
	of trust and bylaws, and Maryland law, all matters submitted to the shareholders for approval, except for those matters listed below, are approved if a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is
	present are voted in favor of approval. The following matters require approval other than by a majority of all votes cast:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the election of trustees (which requires a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting of our shareholders at which a quorum is present), provided, however, that if any trustee does not receive a majority of all the
	votes cast where the number of nominees is the same as the number of trustees to be elected, such trustee shall tender his or her resignation within five business days after certification of the vote and such resignation shall be acted upon by our
	Board of Trustees within sixty days of such certification;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the removal of trustees (which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the number of shares outstanding and entitled to vote on such a matter if the removal is approved or recommended by a vote of
	at least two-thirds of the Board of Trustees or the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the number of shares then outstanding and entitled to vote on such matter if the removal is not approved or recommended by a vote of at least
	two-thirds of the Board of Trustees);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the amendment of our declaration of trust by shareholders (which requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter only if the amendment was not approved by a unanimous vote of
	the Board of Trustees, but requires the affirmative vote of only a majority of votes entitled to be cast on the matter if the amendment was approved by a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees);




	 




	 


	


	 


	our termination, winding up of affairs and liquidation (which requires, after approval by a majority of the entire Board of Trustees, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
	matter); and




	 




	 


	


	 


	our merger or consolidation with another entity or sale of all or substantially all of our property (which requires the approval of the Board of Trustees and an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled
	to be cast on the matter).

	Our declaration of trust permits the Board of Trustees to revoke our election to be taxed as a
	REIT under the Code or to determine that compliance with any restriction or limitations on ownership and transfers of shares set forth in the declaration of trust is no longer required in order for us to qualify as a REIT. Our declaration of trust
	also permits the Board of Trustees to amend the declaration of trust from time to time, without approval by you or the other shareholders, to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	qualify as a real estate investment trust under Maryland REIT law or the Code; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	to increase or decrease the authorized aggregate number of shares and number of authorized shares of any class or series.




	In addition, any provision of our bylaws may be adopted, altered or repealed either by our Board of Trustees, subject to certain limitations
	contained in our bylaws, without any action by the shareholders or by the shareholders at any meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, by the affirmative vote of holders of not less than a majority of the shares then outstanding and entitled
	to vote.




	Preemptive Rights.


	Under the declaration of trust, no holder of shares of beneficial interest has any preemptive
	rights to subscribe to any issuance of additional shares. The board of trustees, in classifying or reclassifying any unissued shares of beneficial interest, however, has the right to grant holders of shares preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe
	for additional shares of beneficial interest or other securities.

	Series 1 Preferred Shares



	In March 2007, we issued 399,896 Series 1 preferred shares and we filed articles supplementary to our declaration of trust setting forth the
	terms of the Series 1 preferred shares. Below is a brief description of the terms of the Series 1 preferred shares, which is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the articles supplementary.




	Rank.


	The Series 1 preferred shares rank prior to the common shares with respect to the payment of dividends and the
	distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Our declaration of trust provides that, unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding Series 1 preferred shares and any other class or series of our shares of beneficial
	interest ranking, as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on a parity with the Series 1 preferred shares, or Parity Shares, shall have been declared and paid or declared and set
	apart for payment for all past dividend periods, then no dividends, other than dividends paid solely in common shares, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase common shares, or any other shares of beneficial interest which rank
	junior to the Series 1 preferred shares with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or Junior Shares, shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the common
	shares nor shall any Junior Shares be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of common shares made for purposes of any employee incentive or benefit plan of ours) for any consideration by
	us, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Junior Shares).




	Dividends.


	Each
	Series 1 preferred share is entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our Board of Trustees out of funds legally available for that purpose, cumulative preferential dividends payable in cash at a rate of 5.417% of the liquidation price
	of $25, which is equivalent to $1.35425 per annum.




	Liquidation Preference.


	In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or
	winding up, the holders of Series 1 preferred shares shall be entitled to receive $25 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, before any distribution shall be made with respect to the common shares.




	Voting Rights.


	The Series 1 preferred shares shall have no voting rights.




	Conversion Rights.


	Subject to other applicable provisions within the articles supplementary for the Series 1 preferred
	shares, from the date of issuance, the Series 1 preferred shares shall be convertible, at the option of each

	Table of Contents



	holder, into a number of fully paid and nonassessable common shares determined by dividing (A) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Series 1 preferred shares being
	converted by (ii) liquidation price; by (B) the option conversion price as in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the option conversion date.




	Transfer Agent and Registrar.


	The transfer agent and registrar for the Series 1 preferred shares is American Stock
	Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, New York, New York.



	Preferred Shares



	In addition to the Series 1 preferred shares, the terms of which are described above, we may issue one or more series of preferred shares. The
	following is a general description of the preferred shares that we may offer from time to time. The particular terms of the preferred shares being offered and the extent to which such general provisions may apply will be set forth in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.




	General.


	Preferred shares may be offered and sold from time to time, in one or more series, as
	authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is authorized by Maryland law and our declaration of trust to set for each series the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
	distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption. The Board of Trustees has the power to set preferences, powers and rights, voting or other terms of preferred shares that are senior to, or better than, the rights of holders of
	common shares or other classes or series of preferred shares. The offer and sale of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of our control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common shares or
	otherwise be favorable to them.




	Terms.


	You should refer to the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of any
	preferred shares for specific terms, including the following terms:

	any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of those preferred shares;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a discussion of any additional federal income tax consequences applicable to those preferred shares; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any limitations on direct or beneficial ownership and restrictions on transfer in addition to those described in  Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer, in each case as may be appropriate to preserve

	18






	Table of Contents



	The terms of any preferred shares we issue through this prospectus will be set forth in articles
	supplementary to our declaration of trust. We will file the articles supplementary as an exhibit to the registration statement that includes this prospectus, or as an exhibit to a filing with the SEC that is incorporated by reference into this
	prospectus. The description of preferred shares in any prospectus supplement will not describe all of the terms of the preferred shares in detail. You should read the applicable articles supplementary for a complete description of all of the terms.




	Rank.


	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, the preferred shares offered through that supplement will, with
	respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, rank:


	 




	 


	


	 


	senior to all classes or series of our common shares, and to all other equity securities ranking junior to those preferred shares;




	 




	 


	


	 


	on a parity with all of our equity securities ranking on a parity with the preferred shares; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	junior to all of our equity securities ranking senior to the preferred shares.




	For purposes
	of this description of our preferred shares, the term equity securities does not include convertible debt securities that we may offer from time to time.




	Dividends.


	Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding shares or series of shares and to the provisions of our
	declaration of trust regarding ownership of shares in excess of the ownership limitation described below under  Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer, our preferred shareholders are entitled to receive dividends, when and as
	authorized by our Board of Trustees, out of legally available funds.




	Redemption.


	If we provide for a redemption right in a
	prospectus supplement, the preferred shares offered through that supplement will be subject to mandatory redemption or redemption at our option, in whole or in part, in each case upon the terms, at the times and at the redemption prices set forth in
	that supplement.




	Liquidation Preference.


	As to any liquidation preference applicable to preferred shares offered through
	this prospectus, the applicable supplement shall provide that, upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of those preferred shares shall receive, before any distribution or payment shall be
	made to the holders of any other class or series of shares ranking junior to those preferred shares in our distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment or provision for payment of our debts and other
	liabilities, out of our assets legally available for distribution to shareholders, liquidating distributions in the amount of any liquidation preference per share (set forth in the applicable supplement), plus an amount, if applicable, equal to all
	distributions accrued and unpaid thereon (not including any accumulation in respect of unpaid distributions for prior distribution periods if those preferred shares do not have a cumulative distribution). After payment of the full amount of the
	liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of those preferred shares will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. In the event that, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the
	legally available assets are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all of those outstanding preferred shares and the corresponding amounts payable on all of our shares of other classes or series of equity security
	ranking on a parity with those preferred shares in the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then the holders of those preferred shares and all other such classes or series of equity security shall share ratably in any
	such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.


	If the liquidating distributions are made in full to all holders of preferred shares entitled to receive those distributions prior to any
	other classes or series of equity security ranking junior to the preferred shares upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then our remaining assets shall be distributed among the holders of those junior classes or series of equity shares,
	in each case according to their respective rights and preferences and their respective number of shares.




	Voting Rights.


	Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable supplement, holders of preferred shares we issue in the future will not have any voting rights, except as may be required by applicable law or any applicable rules and regulations of the New York Stock
	Exchange.

	Table of Contents





	Conversion Rights.


	The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any series of
	preferred shares is convertible into common shares will be set forth in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of those preferred shares. These terms typically will include:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the number of common shares into which the preferred shares are convertible;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the conversion price or rate (or manner of calculation thereof);

	


	 


	provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of the preferred shares or at our option;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the events requiring an adjustment of the conversion price; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	provisions affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of that series of preferred shares.






	Transfer Agent and Registrar.


	We will identify the transfer agent and registrar for any additional series of preferred shares
	issued through this prospectus in a prospectus supplement.



	Depositary Shares





	General.


	We may issue receipts for depositary shares, each of which will represent a fractional interest of a share of a
	particular series of preferred shares. We will deposit the preferred shares of any series represented by depositary shares with a depositary under a deposit agreement. We will identify the depositary in a prospectus supplement. Subject to the terms
	of the deposit agreement, if you own a depositary share, you will be entitled, in proportion to the fraction of the preferred share represented by your depositary share, to all of the rights and preferences to which you would be entitled if you
	owned the preferred share represented by your depositary share directly (including dividend, voting, redemption, conversion, subscription and liquidation rights).


	The depositary shares will be represented by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the applicable deposit agreement. Immediately following
	the issuance and delivery of our preferred shares to the depositary, we will cause the depositary to issue, on our behalf, the depositary receipts. Upon request, we will provide you with copies of the applicable form of deposit agreement and
	depositary receipt.




	Dividends and Other Provisions.


	If you are a record holder (as defined below) of depositary
	receipts and we pay a cash dividend or other cash distribution with respect to the preferred share represented by your depositary share, the depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions it receives in respect of the
	preferred shares represented by your depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares you owned on the record date for that dividend or distribution.


	If we make a distribution in a form other than cash, the depositary will distribute the property it receives to you and all other record
	holders of depositary receipts in an equitable manner, unless the depositary determines that it is not feasible to do so. If the depositary decides it cannot feasibly distribute the property, it may sell the property and distribute the net proceeds
	from the sale to you and the other record holders. The amount the depositary distributes in any of the foregoing cases may be reduced by any amounts that we or the depositary is required to withhold on account of taxes.


	A record holder is a person who holds depositary receipts on the record date for any dividend, distribution or other action. The
	record date for depositary shares will be the same as the record date for the preferred shares represented by those depositary receipts.




	Withdrawal of Preferred Shares.


	If you surrender your depositary receipts, the depositary will be required to deliver
	certificates to you evidencing the number of preferred shares represented by those receipts (but only in whole shares). If you deliver depositary receipts representing a number of depositary shares that is greater than the number of whole shares to
	be withdrawn, the depositary will deliver to you, at the same time, a new depositary receipt evidencing the fractional shares.




	Redemption of Depositary Shares.


	If we redeem a series of preferred shares represented by depositary receipts, the depositary
	will redeem depositary shares from the proceeds it receives after redemption of the preferred shares. The redemption price per depositary share will equal the applicable fraction of the redemption price per share payable with respect to that series
	of preferred shares. If fewer than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed, the depositary will select shares to be redeemed by lot, pro rata or by any other equitable method it may determine. After the date fixed for redemption, the depositary
	shares called for redemption will no longer be outstanding. All rights of the holders of those depositary shares will cease, except the right to receive the redemption price that the holders of the depositary shares were entitled to receive upon
	redemption. Payments will be made when holders surrender their depositary receipts to the depositary.

	Table of Contents





	Voting the Preferred Shares.


	When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at
	which the holders of preferred shares are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail information contained in the notice to you as a record holder of the depositary shares relating to the preferred shares. As a record holder of the depositary shares
	on the record date (which will be the same date as the record date for the preferred shares), you will be entitled to instruct the depositary as to how you would like your votes to be exercised. The depositary will endeavor, insofar as practicable,
	to vote the number of preferred shares represented by your depositary shares in accordance with your instructions. We will agree to take all reasonable action that the depositary may deem necessary to enable the depositary to do this. If you do not
	send specific instructions the depositary will not vote the preferred shares represented by your depositary shares.




	Liquidation
	Preference.


	In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, you will be entitled, as a record holder of depositary shares, to the fraction of the liquidation preference accorded each applicable
	preferred share, as has been set forth in a prospectus supplement.




	Conversion of Preferred Shares.


	Our depositary shares,
	as such, are not convertible into common shares or any of our other securities or property. Nevertheless, if so specified in a prospectus supplement, the depositary receipts may be surrendered by their holders to the depositary with written
	instructions to the depositary to instruct us to cause conversion of the preferred shares represented by the depositary shares into whole common or preferred shares, as the case may be. We will agree that, upon receipt of this type of instructions
	and any amounts payable, we will convert the depositary shares using the same procedures as those provided for delivery of preferred shares to effect such conversion. If the depositary shares are to be converted in part only, one or more new
	depositary receipts will be issued for any depositary shares not to be converted. No fractional common shares will be issued upon conversion, and if such conversion will result in issuance of a fractional share, we will pay an amount of cash equal
	to the value of the fractional interest based upon the closing price of the common shares on the last business day prior to the conversion.




	Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement.


	We and the depositary may amend the form of depositary receipt and any
	provision of the deposit agreement at any time. However, any amendment which materially and adversely alters your rights as a holder of depositary shares will not be effective unless the holders of at least a majority of the depositary shares then
	outstanding approve the amendment. The deposit agreement will only terminate if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	we redeem all outstanding depositary shares;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we make a final distribution in respect of the preferred shares to which the depositary shares and agreement relate, including in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up and the distribution has been
	distributed to the holders of depositary shares; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	each preferred share to which the depositary shares and agreement relate shall have been converted into shares of beneficial interest not represented by depositary shares.






	Resignation and Removal of Depositary.


	The depositary may resign at any time by delivering a notice to us of its election to do
	so. Additionally, we may remove the depositary at any time. Any resignation or removal will take effect when we appoint a successor depositary and the successor accepts the appointment. We must appoint a successor depositary within 60 days after
	delivery of the notice of resignation or removal. A successor depositary must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the U.S. and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million.




	Charges of Depositary.


	We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of
	the depositary arrangements. We will pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the preferred shares and issuance of depositary receipts, all withdrawals of preferred shares by owners of the depositary shares and any
	redemption of the preferred shares. You will pay other transfer and other taxes, governmental charges and other charges expressly provided for in the deposit agreement.




	Miscellaneous.


	The depositary will forward to you all reports and communications from us that we are required, or otherwise
	determine, to furnish to the holders of the preferred shares. The holders of depositary receipts shall have the right to inspect the transfer books of the depositary and the list of holders of depositary receipts as provided in the applicable
	deposit agreement or as required by law.


	 


	21






	Table of Contents



	Neither we nor the depositary will be liable under the deposit agreement to you other than for
	the depositarys gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Neither we nor the depositary will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding in respect of any depositary shares or preferred shares unless satisfactory
	indemnity is furnished. We and the depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or accountants, or upon information provided by persons presenting preferred shares for deposit, holders of depositary receipts or other persons believed to be
	competent and on documents believed to be genuine.



	Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer



	Restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares are important to ensure that we meet certain conditions under the Code to qualify as a REIT.
	For example, the Code contains the following requirements.


	 




	 


	


	 


	No more than 50% in value of a REITs shares may be owned, actually or constructively (based on attribution rules in the Code), by five or fewer individuals during the last half of a taxable year or a proportionate
	part of a shorter taxable year, which we refer to as the 5/50 Rule. Under the Code, individuals include certain tax-exempt entities except that qualified domestic pension funds are not generally treated as individuals.




	 




	 


	


	 


	If a REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of a REIT, is treated as owning 10% or more of a tenant of the REITs property, the rent received by the REIT from the tenant will not be qualifying income for
	purposes of the REIT gross income tests of the Code.




	 




	 


	


	 


	A REITs stock or beneficial interests must be owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year.




	In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, our declaration of trust, subject to certain exceptions described below, provides that no
	person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding common shares or more than 9.8% in value of our outstanding
	capital stock. In this prospectus, the term ownership limitation is used to describe this provision of our declaration of trust.


	Any transfer of shares will be null and void, and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares if the transfer:


	 




	 


	


	 


	results in any person owning, directly or indirectly, shares in excess of the ownership limitation;




	 




	 


	


	 


	results in the shares being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution);




	 




	 


	


	 


	results in our being closely held (within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code);




	 




	 


	


	 


	causes us to own, directly or constructively, 10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of our real property (within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code); or




	 




	 


	


	 


	otherwise results in our failure to qualify as a REIT.






	Automatic Transfer of Shares to
	Trust



	.





	With certain exceptions described below, if any purported transfer of shares would violate any of the restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph, then the transfer will be null and void, and
	those shares will be designated as shares-in-trust and transferred automatically to a charitable trust. The transfer to the trust is effective as of the end of the business day before the purported transfer of such shares. The record
	holder of the shares that are designated as shares-in-trust must deliver those shares to us for registration in the name of the trust. We will designate a trustee who is not affiliated with us. The beneficiary of the trust will be one or more
	charitable organizations named by us.


	Any shares-in-trust remain issued and outstanding shares and are entitled to the same rights and
	privileges as all other shares of the same class or series. The trust receives all dividends and distributions on the shares-in-trust and holds such dividends and distributions in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. The trustee votes all
	shares-in-trust. The trustee shall also designate a permitted transferee of the shares-in-trust. The permitted transferee must purchase the shares-in-trust for valuable consideration and acquire the shares-in-trust without resulting in the transfer
	being null and void.

	The record holder with respect to shares-in-trust must pay the trust any dividends or
	distributions received by such record holder that are attributable to any shares-in-trust if the record date for those shares-in-trust was on or after the date that such shares became shares-in-trust. Upon sale or other disposition of the
	shares-in-trust to a permitted transferee, the record holder generally will receive from the trustee, the lesser of:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the price per share, if any, paid by the record holder for the shares; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	if no amount was paid for such shares (e.g., if such shares were received through a gift or devise),




	 




	 


	


	 


	the price per share equal to the market price (which is calculated as defined in our declaration of trust) on the date the shares were received, or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the price per share received by the trustee from the sale of such shares-in-trust.




	Any
	amounts received by the trustee in excess of the amounts paid to the record owner will be distributed to the beneficiary. Unless sooner sold to a permitted transferee, upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the record owner generally will
	receive from the trustee its share of the liquidation proceeds but in no case more than the price per share paid by the record owner or, in the case of a gift or devise, the market price per share on the date such shares were received by the trust.


	The shares-in-trust will be offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of the price per share in
	the transaction that created the shares-in-trust (or, in the case of a gift or devise, the market price per share on the date of such transfer) or the market price per share on the date that we, or our designee, accepts such offer. We may accept
	such offer until the trustee has sold the shares-in-trust as provided above.


	Any person who acquires or attempts to acquire shares which
	would be null and void under the restrictions described above, or any person who owned common shares or preferred shares that were transferred to a trust, must both give us immediate written notice of such event and provide us such other information
	as requested in order to determine the effect, if any, of such transfer on our status as a REIT.


	If a shareholder owns more than 5% of
	the outstanding common shares or preferred shares, then the shareholder must notify us of its share ownership by January 30 of each year.


	The ownership limitation generally does not apply to the acquisition of shares by an underwriter that participates in a public offering of
	such shares. In addition, the Board of Trustees may exempt a person from the ownership limitation under certain circumstances and conditions. The restrictions on ownership and transfer described in this section of this prospectus will continue to
	apply until the Board of Trustees determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT.


	The Board of Trustees has agreed to exempt from the ownership limitation BlackRock, Inc., or BlackRock, for itself, its subsidiaries and on
	behalf of investment funds and accounts for whom BlackRock acts as manager or investment advisor with respect to ownership of our equity shares. The Board of Trustees approved an exemption for BlackRock which permits BlackRock and its subsidiaries
	and investment funds and accounts combined, to the extent they comprise a group under SEC rules, to own up to 15.0% of our outstanding equity or common shares. BlackRock and each of its subsidiaries and investment funds and accounts will remain
	individually subject to the ownership limitation. The exemption will terminate upon at least 30 days notice given by us, with such notice not to be given before April 30, 2015.


	The Board of Trustees has also agreed to exempt from the ownership limitation Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., or
	Cohen & Steers, for itself, its affiliates and on behalf of the mutual funds and institutional investor client accounts it advises with respect to ownership of our common shares. The Board of Trustees approved an exemption for
	Cohen & Steers which permits Cohen & Steers and its affiliates and mutual funds and investor client accounts, combined, to own up to 15.0% of our outstanding common shares. The exemption will expire upon prior notice given by us to
	Cohen & Steers in the event its mutual funds and investor client accounts no longer own at least 7.0% of our common shares for 180 days in any calendar year.

	Table of Contents



	The ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction
	or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or preferred shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders. All certificates representing shares will bear a legend referring to the restrictions
	described above.



	Warrants





	Warrants



	.





	We may issue warrants for the purchase of common or preferred shares. If we offer warrants, we
	will describe the terms in a prospectus supplement. Warrants may be offered independently, together with other securities offered by any prospectus supplement, or through a dividend or other distribution to shareholders and may be attached to or
	separate from other securities. Warrants may be issued under a written warrant agreement to be entered into between us or the holder or beneficial owner, or we could issue warrants pursuant to a written warrant agreement with a warrant agent
	specified in a prospectus supplement. A warrant agent would act solely as our agent in connection with the warrants of a particular series and would not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any holders or beneficial
	owners of such warrants.


	The following are some of the warrant terms that could be described in a prospectus supplement:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the title of the warrant;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the aggregate number of warrants;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the price or prices at which the warrant will be issued;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the designation, number and terms of the preferred shares or common shares that may be purchased on exercise of the warrant;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the date, if any, on and after which the warrant and the related securities will be separately transferable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the price at which each security purchasable on exercise of the warrant may be purchased;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the dates on which the right to purchase the securities purchasable on exercise of the warrant will begin and end;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the minimum or maximum number of securities that may be purchased at any one time;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any anti-dilution protection;




	 




	 


	


	 


	information with respect to book-entry procedures, if any;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a discussion of certain federal income tax considerations; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other warrant terms, including terms relating to transferability, exchange or exercise of the warrant.





	Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws



	The following summary of certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and our declaration of trust and bylaws is not complete.
	You should read the Maryland General Corporation Law and our declaration of trust and bylaws for more complete information.


	The following
	provisions, together with the ability of the Board of Trustees to increase the number of authorized shares, in the aggregate or by class, and to issue preferred shares without further shareholder action, the transfer restrictions described under
	 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer and the supermajority voting rights described under  Common Shares  Voting Rights, may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent trustees or the completion of
	transactions that would be beneficial, in the short term, to our shareholders. The provisions may also discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, other business combination or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a
	large block of our securities or the removal of incumbent management, even if these events would offer our shareholders a premium price on their securities or otherwise be favorable to the interests of our shareholders.




	Business Combinations



	.

	 Applicable Maryland law, as set forth in the Maryland General Corporation Law, limits our
	ability to enter into business combinations and other corporate transactions, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance of equity securities when the combination is
	between us and an interested shareholder (as defined below) or an affiliate of an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is:


	 




	 


	


	 


	any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting shares; or




	 


	24






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	any of our affiliates that beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting shares at any time within two years immediately prior to the applicable date in question.




	We may not engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder or any of its affiliates for five years after
	the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. This prohibition does not apply to business combinations involving us that are exempted by the Board of Trustees before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder.


	We may engage in business combinations with an interested shareholder if at least five years have passed since the person became an interested
	shareholder, but only if the transaction is:


	 




	 


	


	 


	recommended by our Board of Trustees; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	approved by at least,




	 




	 


	


	 


	80% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	two-thirds of our outstanding shares entitled to vote that are not held by the interested shareholder or any of its affiliates.




	Shareholder approval will not be required if our common shareholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the statute) for their shares and
	our shareholders receive cash or the same form of consideration as the interested shareholder paid for its shares.




	Control Share
	Acquisitions.


	Our bylaws exempt acquisitions of our shares of beneficial interest by any person from control share acquisition requirements discussed below. With the approval of our Board of Trustees, and of shareholders holding
	at least a majority of shares outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter, however, we could modify or eliminate the exemption in the future. If the exemption were eliminated, control share acquisitions would be subject to the
	following provisions.


	The Maryland General Corporation Law provides that control shares of a Maryland REIT acquired in a
	control share acquisition have no voting rights unless two-thirds of the shareholders (excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by the officers and trustees who are employees of the Maryland REIT) approve their voting rights.


	Control Shares are shares that, if added to all other shares previously acquired, would entitle that person to exercise voting
	power, in electing trustees, within one of the following ranges of voting power:


	 




	 


	


	 


	one-tenth or more but less than one-third;




	 




	 


	


	 


	one-third or more but less than a majority, or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a majority or more of all voting power.




	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring
	person is entitled to vote with shareholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.


	If this provision becomes applicable to us, a person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition could, under certain
	circumstances, compel our Board of Trustees to call a special meeting of shareholders to consider the voting rights of the control shares. We could also present the question at any shareholders meeting on our own.


	If this provision becomes applicable to us, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we would be able to redeem any or all control
	shares. If voting rights for control shares were approved at a shareholders meeting and the acquirer were entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other shareholders could exercise appraisal rights and exchange their
	shares for a fair value as defined by statute.

	Duties of Trustees



	.





	Under Maryland law, there is a presumption
	that the act of a trustee satisfies the required standard of care. An act of a trustee relating to or affecting an acquisition or a potential acquisition of control is not subject under Maryland law to a higher duty or greater scrutiny than is
	applied to any other act of a trustee.




	Number of Trustees.


	The number of trustees may be increased or decreased pursuant to
	the bylaws, provided that the total number of trustees may not be less than five or more than 10. Under Maryland law and our declaration of trust, trustees are elected for one-year terms.




	Removal of Trustees



	.





	Under the declaration of trust, and subject to the rights of any holders of preferred
	shares, our trustees may remove a trustee with cause, as defined in our declaration of trust, by the vote of all the other trustees or the shareholders may remove a trustee, with or without cause, at any meeting of shareholders called for that
	purpose, either by:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the number of shares outstanding and entitled to vote on that matter if the removal is approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Board of
	Trustees; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the number of shares then outstanding and entitled to vote on that matter if the removal is not approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
	Board of Trustees.






	Vacancies on the Board of Trustees



	.





	The bylaws provide that, subject
	to the rights of any holders of preferred shares, any vacancy on the Board of Trustees, including a vacancy created by an increase in the number of trustees, may be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining trustees, or, if the trustees fail to
	act, at a meeting called for that purpose by the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter. Each trustee so elected shall serve for the unexpired term of the trustee he is replacing.




	Meetings of Shareholders



	.





	Our bylaws provide for an annual meeting of shareholders, to be held in May after
	delivery of the annual report to shareholders, to elect individuals to the Board of Trustees and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. Special meetings of shareholders may be called by our Chairman of the Board
	of Trustees, Chief Executive Officer, President or by one-third of the Board of Trustees, and shall be called at the request in writing of the holders of 25% of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.


	Our declaration of trust provides that any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a
	meeting, if a majority of shares entitled to vote on the matter (or such larger proportion as shall be required to take the action) consent to the action in writing and the written consents are filed with the records of the meetings of shareholders.




	Advance Notice for Shareholder Nominations and Shareholder New Business Proposals



	.





	Our bylaws require
	advance written notice for shareholders to nominate a trustee or bring other business before a meeting of shareholders. For an annual meeting, to nominate a trustee or bring other business before a meeting of shareholders, a shareholder must deliver
	notice to our Secretary not later than the close of business on the 120

	th

	day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement relating to the preceding years annual meeting.
	If the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the preceding years meeting or if we did not hold an annual meeting the preceding year, notice must be delivered within a reasonable time before we begin to
	print and mail our proxy materials.


	For a special meeting, to nominate a trustee, a shareholder must deliver notice to our Secretary not
	earlier that the close of business on the 120

	th

	day prior to the special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
	90

	th

	day prior to the special meeting or the 10

	th

	day following the date on which public announcement is first made of the special meeting.
	Nominations for elections to the Board of Trustees may be made at a special meeting by shareholders of record both at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting and at the time of the special meeting and who are entitled to vote at the
	special meeting and who complied with the notice procedures in our bylaws only (a) pursuant to the notice of special meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Trustees or (c) if the Board of Trustees has determined that
	trustees shall be elected at the special meeting.


	The postponement or adjournment of an annual or special meeting to a later date or time
	shall not commence any new time periods for the giving of notice as described above. Our bylaws contain detailed requirements for the contents of shareholder notices of trustee nominations and new business proposals.

	Shareholder Liability and Indemnification.


	Under Maryland law, you will not be
	personally liable for any obligation of ours solely because you are a shareholder. Under our declaration of trust, our shareholders are not liable for our debts or obligations by reason of being a shareholder and will not be subject to any personal
	liability, in tort, contract or otherwise, to any person in connection with our property or affairs by reason of being a shareholder. Under our bylaws, our shareholders shall have similar indemnification and expense advancement rights as our
	trustees and officers.


	In some jurisdictions other than Maryland, however, with respect to tort claims, contractual claims where
	shareholder liability is not negated by the express terms of the contract, claims for taxes and certain statutory liabilities, our shareholders may be personally liable to the extent that those claims are not satisfied by us. In addition, common law
	theories of piercing the corporate veil may be used to impose liability on shareholders in certain instances.




	Limitation of Liability of Trustees and Officers.


	Our declaration of trust, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law
	in effect from time to time with respect to liability of trustees and officers of a REIT, provides that no trustee or officer of ours shall be liable to us or to any shareholder for money damages. The Maryland General Corporation Law provides that
	we may restrict or limit the liability of trustees or officers for money damages except to the extent:


	 




	 


	


	 


	it is proved that the trustee or officer actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the person is entered in a proceeding based on a finding that the persons action, or failure to act, was material to the cause of action adjudicated and was the
	result of active and deliberate dishonesty.




	Our declaration of trust provides that neither amendment nor repeal or any
	provision of our declaration of trust, nor adoption of any other provision, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of such limitation of liability with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such amendment,
	repeal or adoption.




	Indemnification of Directors and Officers.


	Our declaration of trust permits us to indemnify and advance
	expenses to, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, any individual who is a present or former trustee or officer of ours or to any individual who, while a trustee of ours, serves or has served as a director,
	officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another REIT, corporation partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise, in connection with any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which
	such person may incur by reason of such status.


	Our bylaws require us to indemnify: (a) any trustee, officer or former trustee or
	officer, including any individual who, while a trustee or officer at our express request, serves or served for another REIT, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise as
	a director, officer, shareholder, manager, member, partner or trustee of such entity, who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of a proceeding to which he or she was made a party by reason of service in such capacity,
	against reasonable expenses incurred by him or her in connection with the proceeding; and (b) any trustee or officer or any former trustee or officer against any claim or liability to which he or she may become subject by reason of such status
	unless it is established that: (i) his or her act or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberative dishonesty; (ii) he or she actually received
	an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or (iii) in the case of a criminal proceeding, he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her act or omission was unlawful. In addition, our bylaws require us, without
	requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a trustee, officer or former trustee or officer made a party to a proceeding by reason of such status, provided that we
	have received from any such trustee or officer an affirmation and written undertaking as required by our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that neither amendment nor repeal or any provision of our bylaws, nor adoption of any other provision, shall apply to
	or affect in any respect the applicability of such indemnification and expense advancement rights with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

	MATERIAL
	FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS



	The following section summarizes the material federal income tax issues that you may consider
	relevant relating to our taxation as a REIT under the Code, and the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common, preferred, and depositary shares. If we offer one or more additional series of common shares or preferred shares, debt
	securities, depositary shares, or warrants to purchase debt or equity securities, the prospectus supplement would include information about additional material U.S. federal income tax considerations to holders of any of the offered securities.


	Because this section is a summary, it does not address all of the tax issues that may be important to you. For example, the discussion of the
	tax treatment of our shareholders addresses only common or preferred shares held as capital assets (generally property held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This discussion is based on current law and does not
	purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a prospective shareholder in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, this section does not address the tax issues that may be important to certain
	types of shareholders that are subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions, brokers, dealers in securities and commodities, insurance companies, former U.S. citizens or long-term residents,
	regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations (except to the extent discussed in  Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders below), controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign
	investment companies, persons that acquire shares in connection with employment or other performance of personal services, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons that are, or that hold their shares through, partnerships or other
	pass-through entities, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons that hold shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, synthetic security or constructive sale transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons
	that purchase or sell shares as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or non-U.S. individuals and foreign corporations (except to the extent discussed in  Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders below). In addition, this discussion is
	general in nature and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations, nor does it address any aspect of state, local or foreign taxation or any U.S. federal tax other than the income tax and, only to the extent specifically provided herein,
	certain excise taxes potentially applicable to REITs.


	This summary is based upon the Code, the regulations of the U.S. Department of
	Treasury (Treasury) promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative rulings now in effect, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.


	If a partnership, including an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial
	owner of our shares, the treatment of the partnership, and partners in the partnership, will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares, and partners in such partnerships, should
	consult their tax advisors with regard to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our shares.


	PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS
	SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON OR PREFERRED SHARES, OUR ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REIT AND THE
	EFFECT OF POTENTIAL CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.



	Taxation of the Company



	The statements in this section are based on the current federal income tax laws governing our qualification as a REIT. We cannot assure you
	that new laws, interpretations of laws or court decisions, any of which may take effect retroactively, will not cause any statement in this section to be inaccurate.


	We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 federal income tax return. We have been organized
	and have operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT and we intend to continue to operate in that manner. This section discusses the laws governing the federal income tax treatment of a REIT and its shareholders. These laws are highly
	technical and complex.


	 


	28






	Table of Contents



	In the opinion of our tax counsel, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, (i) we qualified as
	a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code with respect to each of our taxable years ended through December 31, 2014; and (ii) we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and our
	current method of operation and ownership will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the current taxable year and for future taxable years, provided that we have operated and continue to operate in
	accordance with various assumptions and factual representations made by us concerning our diversity of share ownership, business, properties and operations. We may not, however, have met or continue to meet such requirements. You should be aware
	that opinions of counsel are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or any court. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, certain qualification tests set forth in the federal tax
	laws. Those qualification tests involve the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources, the percentage of our assets that fall within certain categories, the diversity of the ownership of our shares, and the percentage of our earnings
	that we distribute. We describe the REIT qualification tests in more detail below. Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP will not monitor our compliance with the requirements for REIT qualification on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, our actual
	operating results may not satisfy the qualification tests. Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLPs opinion does not foreclose the possibility that we may have to use one or more of the REIT savings provisions described below, which would require
	us to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be material) in order for us to maintain our REIT qualification. For a discussion of the tax treatment of us and our shareholders if we fail to qualify as a REIT, see  Requirements for REIT
	Qualification  Failure to Qualify.


	As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income
	that we distribute to our shareholders. The benefit of that tax treatment is that it avoids the double taxation (i.e., at both the corporate and shareholder levels) that generally results from owning shares in a subchapter C corporation.
	However, we will be subject to federal tax in the following circumstances:


	 




	 


	


	 


	we will pay federal income tax on taxable income (including net capital gain) that we do not distribute to our shareholders during, or within a specified time period after, the calendar year in which the income is
	earned;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on any items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our shareholders;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will pay income tax at the highest corporate rate on (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of property acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or a lease of
	the property (foreclosure property) that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and (ii) other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will pay a 100% tax on net income from certain sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property) that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business
	(prohibited transactions);




	 




	 


	


	 


	our subsidiaries that are C corporations, including our taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will be required to pay federal corporate income tax on their earnings;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will pay a 100% excise tax on transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary that are not conducted on an arms-length basis;

	if we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (as described below under Requirements for REIT Qualification  Income Tests), but nonetheless continue to qualify
	as a REIT because we meet certain other requirements, we will pay a 100% tax on (i) the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail, respectively, the 75% or 95% gross income test, multiplied, in either case, by
	(ii) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;




	 




	 


	


	 


	if we fail, in more than a de minimis fashion, to satisfy one or more of the asset tests for any quarter of a taxable year, but nonetheless continue to qualify as a REIT because we qualify under certain relief
	provisions, we may be required to pay a tax of the greater of $50,000 or a tax computed at the highest corporate rate on the amount of net income generated by the assets causing the failure from the date of failure until the assets are disposed of
	or we otherwise return to compliance with the asset test;




	 




	 


	


	 


	if we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements for REIT qualification (other than the income tests or the asset tests), we nevertheless may avoid termination of our REIT election in such year if the failure is
	due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, but we would also be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements;

	if we fail to distribute during a calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (iii) any
	undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will pay a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over (A) the amount we actually distributed, plus (B) retained amounts on which corporate-level tax was
	paid by us;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record-keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with the rules relating to the composition of
	a REITs shareholders;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gain; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	if we acquire any asset from a C corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate-level tax) in a merger or other transaction in which we acquire a carryover basis in the asset (i.e.,
	basis determined by reference to the C corporations basis in the asset (or another asset)) and no election is made for the transaction to be taxable on a current basis, then if we recognize gain on the sale or disposition of such asset during
	the 10-year period after we acquire such asset, we will pay tax at the highest regular corporate rate applicable on the lesser of (i) the amount of gain that we recognize at the time of the sale or disposition and (ii) the amount of gain
	that we would have recognized if we had sold the asset at the time we acquired the asset.





	Requirements for REIT Qualification



	To qualify as a REIT, we must meet the following requirements:


	 




	 


	1.


	we are managed by one or more trustees or directors;




	 




	 


	2.


	our beneficial ownership is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;




	 




	 


	3.


	we would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code;




	 




	 


	4.


	we are neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code;




	 




	 


	5.


	at least 100 persons are beneficial owners of our shares or ownership certificates;




	 




	 


	6.


	not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares or ownership certificates is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of
	any taxable year (the 5/50 Rule);




	 




	 


	7.


	we elect to be a REIT (or have made such election for a previous taxable year) and satisfy all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the IRS that must be met to elect and maintain REIT
	status;




	 




	 


	8.


	we use a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and comply with the record keeping requirements of the Code and the related regulations of the Treasury; and




	 




	 


	9.


	we meet certain other qualification tests, described below, regarding the nature of our income and assets and the amount of our distributions to shareholders.




	We must meet requirements 1 through 4 during our entire taxable year and must meet requirement 5 during at least 335 days of a taxable year of
	12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. If we comply with all the requirements for ascertaining the ownership of our outstanding shares in a taxable year and have no reason to know that we violated
	the 5/50 Rule, we will be deemed to have satisfied the 5/50 Rule for such taxable year. For purposes of determining share ownership under the 5/50 Rule, an individual generally includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefits
	plan, a private foundation, or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes. An individual, however, generally does not include a trust that is a qualified employee pension or profit sharing
	trust under Code Section 401(a), and beneficiaries of such a trust will be treated as holding our shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the trust for purposes of the 5/50 Rule.


	 


	30






	Table of Contents



	We believe we have issued sufficient shares with sufficient diversity of ownership to satisfy
	requirements 5 and 6 set forth above. In addition, our declaration of trust restricts the ownership and transfer of our shares so that we should continue to satisfy requirements 5 and 6. The provisions of our declaration of trust restricting the
	ownership and transfer of our shares are described in Description of Shares of Beneficial OwnershipRestrictions on Ownership and Transfer.


	We currently have several direct corporate subsidiaries and may have additional corporate subsidiaries in the future. A corporation that is a
	qualified REIT subsidiary is not treated as a corporation separate from its parent REIT. All assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary are treated as assets, liabilities, and items of
	income, deduction, and credit of the REIT. A qualified REIT subsidiary is a corporation, all of the capital stock of which is owned by the parent REIT, unless we and the subsidiary have jointly elected to have it treated as a taxable REIT
	subsidiary, in which case it is treated separately from us and will be subject to federal corporate income taxation. Thus, in applying the requirements described herein, any qualified REIT subsidiary of ours will be ignored, and all assets,
	liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of such subsidiary will be treated as our assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit. We believe all of our direct corporate subsidiaries are qualified REIT subsidiaries,
	except for those that would qualify as taxable REIT subsidiaries or subsidiary REITs. Accordingly, our qualified REIT subsidiaries are not subject to federal corporate income taxation, though they may be subject to state and local taxation.


	An unincorporated domestic entity, such as a partnership or limited liability company, that has a single beneficial owner generally is not
	treated as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes. Similar to a qualified REIT subsidiary, all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of such a disregarded entity are treated as assets,
	liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the owner. An unincorporated domestic entity, such as a partnership or a limited liability company, with two or more beneficial owners is generally treated as a partnership for federal
	income tax purposes. A REIT is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of any partnership (which includes any limited liability company treated as a partnership) in which it is a partner and as earning its allocable share of the
	gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable REIT qualification tests. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any partnership (or limited liability company treated as a partnership) in which we have
	acquired or will acquire an interest, directly or indirectly, are treated as our assets and gross income for purposes of applying the various REIT qualification requirements. Our proportionate share is generally determined, for these purposes, based
	on our percentage interest in partnership equity capital, subject to special rules relating to the 10% asset test described below.




	Income Tests.


	 We must satisfy two gross income tests annually to maintain our qualification as a REIT:


	 




	 


	


	 


	At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, cancellation of indebtedness, certain real estate liability hedges, and certain foreign currency hedges entered into, and certain
	recognized real estate foreign exchange gains) for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income that we derive, directly or indirectly, from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or qualified temporary
	investment income (the 75% gross income test). Qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test includes rents from real property, interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real
	property, gain from the sale of real estate assets, and dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale of shares in other REITs; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, cancellation of indebtedness, certain real estate liability hedges, and certain foreign currency hedges entered into, and certain
	recognized passive foreign exchange gains) for each taxable year must consist of income that is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, dividends, other types of interest, gain from the sale or disposition of stock or
	securities, or any combination of the foregoing (the 95% gross income test).




	 


	31






	Table of Contents



	The following paragraphs discuss the specific application of these tests to us.




	Rental Income


	. Our primary source of income derives from leasing properties. There are various limitations on whether rent
	that we receive from real property that we own and lease to tenants will qualify as rents from real property (which is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests) under the REIT tax rules:


	 




	 


	


	 


	If the rent is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits of any person although, generally, rent may be based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, the rent will not qualify as
	rents from real property. Our leases provide for either fixed rent, sometimes with scheduled escalations, or a fixed minimum rent and a percentage of gross receipts in excess of some threshold. We have not entered into any lease based in
	whole or part on the net income of any person and on an ongoing basis will use our best efforts to avoid entering into such arrangements unless, in either instance, we have determined or we determine in our discretion that such arrangements will not
	jeopardize our status as a REIT;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Except in certain limited circumstances involving taxable REIT subsidiaries, if we or someone who owns 10% or more of our shares owns 10% or more of a tenant from whom we receive rent, the tenant is deemed a
	related party tenant, and the rent paid by the related party tenant will not qualify as rents from real property. Our ownership and the ownership of a tenant is determined based on direct, indirect and constructive ownership.
	The constructive ownership rules generally provide that if 10% or more in value of our shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, we are considered as owning the shares owned, directly or indirectly, by or for such person. The
	applicable attribution rules, however, are highly complex and difficult to apply, and we may inadvertently enter into leases with tenants who, through application of such rules, will constitute related party tenants. In such event, rent
	paid by the related party tenant will not qualify as rents from real property, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT. We believe that we have not leased property to any related party tenant, except where we may rent to certain
	taxable REIT subsidiaries as described below, or where we have determined in our discretion that the rent received from such related party tenant is not material and will not jeopardize our status as a REIT. On an ongoing basis, we will use our best
	efforts not to rent any property to a related party tenant (taking into account the applicable constructive ownership rules), unless we determine in our discretion that the rent received from such related party tenant will not jeopardize our status
	as a REIT;




	 




	 


	


	 


	In the case of certain rent from a taxable REIT subsidiary which would, but for this exception, be considered rent from a related party tenant, the space leased to the taxable REIT subsidiary must be part of a property
	at least 90% of which is rented to persons other than taxable REIT subsidiaries and related party tenants, and the amounts of rent paid to us by the taxable REIT subsidiary must be substantially comparable to the rents paid by such other persons for
	comparable space. On an ongoing basis we use and will use our best efforts to ensure that all space leased to our taxable REIT subsidiaries meets these conditions, unless we determine in our discretion that the related party rent received from a
	taxable REIT subsidiary will not jeopardize our status as a REIT;




	 




	 


	


	 


	If the rent attributable to any personal property leased in connection with a lease of property is more than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, all of the rent attributable to the personal property will
	fail to qualify as rents from real property. In general, we have not leased a significant amount of personal property under our current leases. If any incidental personal property has been leased, we believe that rent under each lease
	from the personal property has been no more than 15% of total rent from that lease, and on an ongoing basis we will use our best efforts to avoid leasing personal property in connection with a future lease except where rent from the personal
	property is no more than 15% of total rent from that lease, unless, in either instance, we have determined or we determine in our discretion that the amount of disqualified rent attributable to the personal property will not jeopardize our status as
	a REIT;




	 




	 


	


	 


	In general, if we furnish or render services to our tenants, other than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an independent contractor who is adequately compensated and from whom we do not derive revenue,
	the income received from the tenants may not be deemed rents from real property. We may provide services directly, if the services are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only
	and are not otherwise considered to be provided for the tenants convenience. In addition, we may render directly a de minimis amount of non-customary services to the tenants of a property without disqualifying the income as
	rents from real property, as long as our income from the services does not exceed 1% of our income from the related property. We believe that we have not provided services to leased properties that have caused rents to be disqualified as
	rents from real property, and on an ongoing basis in the future, we will use our best efforts to determine in our discretion that any services provided will not cause rents to be disqualified as rents from real property, or unless, in either
	instance, we have determined or we determine in our discretion that the amount of disqualified rent resulting from such services will not jeopardize our status as a REIT.




	 


	32






	Table of Contents



	Based on, and subject to, the foregoing, we believe that rent from our leases should generally
	qualify as rents from real property for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, except in amounts that should not jeopardize our status as a REIT. As described above, however, the IRS may assert successfully a contrary position
	and, therefore, prevent us from qualifying as a REIT.




	Interest.


	For purposes of the gross income tests, the term
	interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or
	accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. If a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the
	borrowers gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the propertys value as of a specific date, income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the
	property securing the loan, which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.


	We may from time to time hold
	mortgage debt. Interest on debt secured by a mortgage on real property or on interests in real property, including, for this purpose, discount points, prepayment penalties, loan assumption fees, and late payment charges that are not compensation for
	services, generally is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. However, in the case of acquisition of an existing loan, if the loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan
	outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan, then a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of
	the 75% gross income test, but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. The portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test will be equal to the portion of the
	principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property  that is, the amount by which the loan principal exceeds the value of the real estate that is security for the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan.




	Dividends.


	Our share of any dividends received from any corporation (including any taxable REIT subsidiary, but excluding any
	REIT) in which we own an equity interest will qualify for purposes of the 95% gross income test but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Our share of any dividends received from any other REIT in which we own an equity interest will be
	qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.




	Tax on Income From Property Acquired in Foreclosure.


	We will be
	subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property (other than income that would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test), less expenses directly connected to the production of such income.
	However, gross income from foreclosure property will qualify under the 75% and 95% gross income tests.


	Foreclosure property
	is any real property (including interests in real property) and any personal property incident to such real property:


	 




	 


	


	 


	that is acquired by a REIT at a foreclosure sale, or having otherwise become the owner or in possession of the property by agreement or process of law, after a default (or imminent default) on a lease of such property
	or on a debt owed to the REIT secured by the property;




	 




	 


	


	 


	for which the related loan was acquired by the REIT at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	for which the REIT makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property.




	A
	REIT will not be considered to have foreclosed on a property where it takes control of the property as a mortgagee-in-possession and cannot receive any profit or sustain any loss except as a creditor of the mortgagor. Generally, property acquired as
	described above ceases to be foreclosure property on the earlier of:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the last day of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the REIT acquired the property (or longer if an extension is granted by the Secretary of the Treasury);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the first day on which a lease is entered into with respect to such property that, by its terms, will give rise to income that does not qualify under the 75% gross income test or any amount is received or accrued,
	directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify under the 75% gross income test;




	 


	33






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	the first day on which any construction takes place on such property (other than completion of a building, or any other improvement, where more than 10% of the construction of such building or other improvement was
	completed before default became imminent); or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the first day that is more than 90 days after the day on which such property was acquired by the REIT and the property is used in a trade or business that is conducted by the REIT (other than through an independent
	contractor from whom the REIT itself does not derive or receive any income).






	Tax on Prohibited Transactions.


	A REIT will incur a 100% tax on net income (taking into account foreign currency gains and losses) derived from any prohibited transaction. A prohibited transaction generally is a sale or other disposition of property (other
	than foreclosure property) that the REIT holds primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. The prohibited transaction rules do not apply to property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary of a REIT. We believe that none
	of our assets (other than certain assets held through our taxable REIT subsidiaries) are held for sale to customers and that a sale of any such asset would not be in the ordinary course of our business. Whether a REIT holds an asset primarily
	for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends, however, on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time, including those related to a particular asset.


	The Code provides a safe harbor that, if met by us, allows us to avoid being treated as engaged in a prohibited transaction. In order to meet
	the safe harbor, (i) we must have held the property for at least 2 years (and, in the case of property which consists of land or improvements not acquired through foreclosure, we must have held the property for 2 years for the production of
	rental income), (ii) we must not have made aggregate expenditures includible in the basis of the property during the 2-year period preceding the date of sale that exceed 30% of the net selling price of the property, and (iii) during the
	taxable year the property is disposed of, we must not have made more than 7 property sales or, alternatively, the aggregate adjusted basis or fair market value of all of the properties sold by us during the taxable year must not exceed 10% of the
	aggregate adjusted basis or 10% of the fair market value, respectively, of all of our assets as of the beginning of the taxable year. If the 7 sale limitation in (iii) above is not satisfied, substantially all of the marketing and development
	expenditures with respect to the property must be made through an independent contractor from whom we do not derive or receive any income. We believe we have complied with the terms of the safe harbor provision and we will attempt to comply with the
	terms of the safe harbor in the future, except where we determine in our discretion that a particular transaction will avoid prohibited transaction treatment regardless of the safe harbor. We may fail to comply with the safe-harbor provision and may
	sell or dispose of property that could be characterized as property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.




	Tax and Deduction Limits on Certain Transactions with Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.


	A REIT will incur a 100% tax on certain
	transactions between a REIT and a taxable REIT subsidiary to the extent the transactions are not on an arms-length basis. In addition, under certain circumstances the interest paid by a taxable REIT subsidiary to the REIT may not be deductible by
	the taxable REIT subsidiary. We believe that none of the transactions we have had with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will give rise to the 100% tax and that none of our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be subject to the interest deduction limits.




	Hedging Transactions.


	Except to the extent provided by Treasury regulations, any income we derive from a hedging transaction
	(which may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, options to purchase these items, and futures and forward contracts) which is clearly identified as such as specified in the Code and Treasury regulations, including gain from
	the sale or disposition of such a transaction, will not constitute gross income for purposes of either the 75% or 95% gross income test, and therefore will be exempt from these tests, but only to the extent that the transaction hedges indebtedness
	incurred or to be incurred by us to acquire or carry real estate assets or is entered into primarily to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations with respect to qualifying income under the 75% or 95% gross income test. Income from any
	hedging transaction not described above will likely be treated as nonqualifying for both the 75% and 95% gross income tests.




	Like-Kind Exchanges.


	We may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as like-kind exchanges under the Code.
	Such like-kind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for federal income tax purposes. The failure of any such transaction to qualify as a like-kind exchange could require us to pay federal income tax, possibly including the 100%
	prohibited transaction tax, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction.

	Relief from Consequences of Failing to Meet Income Tests.


	 If we fail to
	satisfy one or both of the 75% and 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we nevertheless may qualify as a REIT for such year if we qualify for relief under certain provisions of the Code. Those relief provisions generally will be available if
	our failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, and we file a schedule of the sources of our income in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury. We may not qualify for the relief provisions in
	all circumstances. In addition, as discussed above in   Taxation of the Company, even if the relief provisions apply, we would incur a 100% tax on gross income to the extent we fail the 75% or 95% gross income test (whichever
	amount is greater), multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.




	Asset Tests.


	To maintain our
	qualification as a REIT, we also must satisfy the following asset tests at the close of each quarter of each taxable year:


	 




	 


	


	 


	At least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of cash or cash items (including certain receivables and money market funds), U.S. government securities, real estate assets, or qualifying
	temporary investments (the 75% asset test).




	 




	 


	


	 


	Real estate assets include interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property and stock in other REITs. We believe that our properties qualify as real estate assets.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Interests in real property include an interest in mortgage loans or land and improvements thereon, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including items that are structural components
	of such buildings or structures), a leasehold of real property, and an option to acquire real property (or a leasehold of real property).




	 




	 


	


	 


	Qualifying temporary investments are investments in stock or debt instruments during the one-year period following our receipt of new capital that we raise through equity or long-term (at least five-year) debt
	offerings.

	For investments not included in the 75% asset test, (A) the value of our interest in any one issuers securities (which does not include our equity ownership of other REITs, any taxable REIT subsidiary, or any
	qualified REIT subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets (the 5% asset test), (B) we may not own more than 10% of the voting power or value of any one issuers outstanding securities (which does not include
	our equity ownership in other REITs, any taxable REIT subsidiary, or any qualified REIT subsidiary (the 10% asset test), (C) the value of our securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries may not exceed 25% of the value of our
	total assets, and (D) no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and our assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. For purposes of the 10% asset
	test that relates to value, the following are not treated as securities: (i) loans to individuals and estates, (ii) securities issued by REITs, (iii) accrued obligations to pay rent; (iv) certain debt meeting the definition of
	straight debt if neither we nor a taxable REIT subsidiary that we control hold more than 1% of the issuers securities that do not qualify as straight debt, and (v) debt issued by a partnership if the partnership
	meets the 75% gross income test with respect to its own gross income. In addition, solely for purposes of the 10% asset test that relates to value, the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership in which we own an interest will be
	based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership, excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the Code.




	We intend to select future investments so as to comply with the asset tests.


	As described above, we may from time to time hold mortgage debt. Mortgage loans will generally qualify as real estate assets for purposes of
	the 75% asset test to the extent that they are secured by real property. However, if a loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of
	the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan, then a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset. Under current law, it is not clear how to determine what portion of such a loan will be
	treated as a real estate asset. Under recently issued guidance, the IRS has stated that it will not challenge a REITs treatment of a loan as being, in part, a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test if the REIT treats the loan as
	being a qualifying real estate asset in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the greater of (a) the current fair market value of the real property securing the loan or (b) the fair market value of such property on the date the REIT
	acquires the loan, or (ii) the fair market value of the loan.

	If we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, we would not lose our
	REIT status if (i) we satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of our assets
	and was not wholly or partly caused by the acquisition of one or more non-qualifying assets. If we did not satisfy the condition described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, we still could avoid disqualification as a REIT by eliminating
	any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which the discrepancy arose.




	Relief from Consequences of
	Failing to Meet Asset Tests.


	 If we fail to satisfy one or more of the asset tests for any quarter of a taxable year, we nevertheless may qualify as a REIT for such year if we qualify for relief under certain provisions of the Code.
	Those relief provisions are available for failures of the 5% asset test and the 10% asset test if (i) the failure is due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of 1% of our total assets or $10 million, and (ii) the
	failure is corrected or we otherwise return to compliance with the applicable asset test within 6 months following the quarter in which it was discovered. In addition, should we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests other than failures addressed in
	the previous sentence, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if (i) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, (ii) we file a schedule with a description of each asset causing the failure in
	accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury, (iii) the failure is corrected or we otherwise return to compliance with the asset tests within 6 months following the quarter in which the failure was discovered, and (iv) we pay a
	tax consisting of the greater of $50,000 or a tax computed at the highest corporate rate on the amount of net income generated by the assets causing the failure from the date of failure until the assets are disposed of or we otherwise return to
	compliance with the asset tests. We may not qualify for the relief provisions in all circumstances.




	Distribution
	Requirements.


	 Each taxable year, we must distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends and deemed distributions of retained capital gain) to our shareholders in an aggregate amount at least equal to (1) the sum of 90% of
	(A) our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (B) our net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) certain items of non-cash
	income.


	We generally must pay such distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if we
	(i) declare a dividend in one of the last three months of the calendar year to which the dividend relates which is payable to shareholders of record as determined in one of such months, and pay the distribution during January of the following
	taxable year, or (ii) declare the distribution before we timely file our federal income tax return for such year and pay the distribution on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration.


	We will pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates on taxable income (including net capital gain) that we do not distribute to
	shareholders. Furthermore, we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax if we fail to distribute during a calendar year (or, in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year, by the
	end of January following such calendar year) at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain income for such year, and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods.
	The excise tax is on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distributed. We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital gain we receive in a taxable year. See  Taxation of
	Taxable U.S. Shareholders. For purposes of the 4% excise tax, we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount. We have made, and we intend to continue to make, timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual
	distribution requirements.


	It is possible that, from time to time, we may experience timing differences between (1) the actual
	receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (2) the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our REIT taxable income. For example, we may not deduct recognized capital losses from our REIT
	taxable income. Further, it is possible that, from time to time, we may be allocated a share of partnership net capital gain attributable to the sale of depreciated property that exceeds our allocable share of cash attributable to that sale. As a
	result of the foregoing, we may have less cash than is necessary to distribute taxable income sufficient to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income or even to meet the 90% distribution requirement. In
	such a situation, we may need to borrow funds, issue preferred shares or additional common shares to raise the cash necessary to make required distributions or, if possible, pay taxable dividends of our shares or debt securities.

	Table of Contents



	We may satisfy the 90% distribution requirement with taxable distributions of our shares or debt
	securities. The IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in shares as dividends that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the
	dividends paid deduction for federal income tax purposes. Those rulings may be relied upon only by taxpayers to whom they were issued, but we could request a similar ruling from the IRS. In addition, the IRS previously issued a revenue procedure
	authorizing publicly traded REITs to make elective cash/share dividends, but that revenue procedures effectiveness has expired and does not apply to our current and future taxable years. Accordingly, it is unclear whether and to what extent we
	will be able to make taxable dividends payable in cash and shares. We have no current intention to make a taxable dividend payable in our shares or debt securities.


	Under certain circumstances, we may be able to correct a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency
	dividends to our shareholders in a later year. We may include such deficiency dividends in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, we will be
	required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends.




	Record Keeping
	Requirements.


	 We must maintain certain records in order to qualify as a REIT. In addition, to avoid a monetary penalty, we must request on an annual basis certain information from our shareholders designed to disclose the actual
	ownership of our outstanding shares. We have complied, and intend to continue to comply, with such requirements.




	Relief from Other
	Failures of the REIT Qualification Provisions.


	 If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements for REIT qualification (other than the income tests or the asset tests), we nevertheless may avoid termination of our REIT election in
	such year if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements. We may not qualify for this relief provision in all circumstances.




	Failure to Qualify.


	 If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applied, we would be
	subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. In calculating our taxable income in a year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be able to deduct
	amounts paid out to shareholders and we would not be required to distribute any amounts to shareholders in such year. In such event, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to shareholders would be
	taxable as ordinary income. Any such dividends should, however, be qualified dividend income, which is taxable at long-term capital gain rates for individual shareholders who satisfy certain holding period requirements. See
	 Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders  Current Tax Rates. Furthermore, subject to certain limitations of the Code, corporate shareholders might be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Unless we qualified for
	relief under specific statutory provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. We cannot predict whether in all circumstances we would
	qualify for such statutory relief.



	Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders



	As used herein, the term taxable U.S. shareholder means a taxable beneficial owner of our common or preferred shares that for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes is:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a citizen or resident of the United States;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any of its states or the District of Columbia;




	 




	 


	


	 


	an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trust if (A) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or
	(B) it has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person.

	Table of Contents



	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of depositary share receipts will be treated as if
	they held the equivalent fraction of the underlying preferred shares. Accordingly, the discussion below with respect to the consequences of holding our preferred shares applies equally to holders of depositary receipts.




	Dividends and Other Taxable U.S. Shareholder Distributions.


	 As long as we qualify as a REIT, a taxable U.S. shareholder
	must take into account distributions on our common or preferred shares out of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (and that we do not designate as capital gain dividends or retained long-term capital gain) as ordinary income. Such
	distributions will not qualify for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations. In addition, dividends paid to taxable U.S. shareholders generally will not qualify for the maximum 20% tax rate for qualified dividend
	income.


	In determining the extent to which a distribution constitutes a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our earnings
	and profits will be allocated first to distributions with respect to our preferred shares and then to distributions with respect to our common shares. If, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the
	distributions paid for the year to our shareholders, the portion of the amount so designated (not in excess of our net capital gain for the year) that will be allocable to the holders of each class or series of preferred shares will be the amount so
	designated, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the total dividends (within the meaning of the Code) paid to the holders of such class or series of preferred shares for the year and the denominator of which will be the total
	dividends paid to the holders of all classes of our shares for the year. The remainder of the designated capital gain dividends will be allocable to holders of our common shares.


	A taxable U.S. shareholder will recognize distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends as long-term capital gain (to the extent
	they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for which the taxable U.S. shareholder has held its common or preferred shares. See  Capital Gains and Losses below. Subject to
	certain limitations, we will designate whether our capital gain dividends are taxable at the usual capital gains rate or at the higher rate applicable to depreciation recapture. A corporate taxable U.S. shareholder, however, may be required to treat
	up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.


	We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital
	gain that we receive in a taxable year. In that case, a taxable U.S. shareholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain. The taxable U.S. shareholder would receive a credit or refund for its
	proportionate share of the tax we paid. The taxable U.S. shareholder would increase the basis in its shares by the amount of its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain, minus its share of the tax we paid.


	A taxable U.S. shareholder will not incur tax on a distribution to the extent it exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits if
	such distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the taxable U.S. shareholders common or preferred shares. Instead, such distribution in excess of earnings and profits will reduce the adjusted basis of such common or preferred shares.
	To the extent a distribution exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the taxable U.S. shareholders adjusted basis in its common or preferred shares, the taxable U.S. shareholder will recognize long-term capital gain
	(or short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less), assuming the shares are a capital asset in the hands of the taxable U.S. shareholder. In addition, if we declare a distribution in October, November, or December of any
	year that is payable to a taxable U.S. shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month, such distribution shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the taxable U.S. shareholder on December 31 of such year, provided that we
	actually pay the distribution during January of the following calendar year. We will notify taxable U.S. shareholders after the close of our taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute return of
	capital, ordinary income or capital gain dividends.




	Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders on the Disposition of Our
	Shares.


	 In general, a taxable U.S. shareholder must treat any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of our common or preferred shares as long-term capital gain or loss if the taxable U.S. shareholder has held the shares for
	more than one year and otherwise as short-term capital gain or loss. A taxable U.S. shareholder will generally realize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the fair market value of any property and the amount of cash
	received in such disposition and the taxable U.S. shareholders adjusted tax basis. A taxable U.S. shareholders adjusted tax basis generally will equal the taxable U.S. shareholders acquisition cost, increased by the excess of net
	capital gains deemed distributed to the taxable U.S. shareholder (discussed above) less tax deemed paid on such gains and reduced by any returns of capital. However, a taxable U.S. shareholder must treat any loss upon a sale or exchange


	 


	38






	Table of Contents



	of common or preferred shares held by such shareholder for six months or less (after applying certain holding period rules) as a long-term capital loss to the extent of capital gain dividends and
	other distributions from us that such taxable U.S. shareholder treats as long-term capital gain.




	Capital Gains and
	Losses.


	 A taxpayer generally must hold a capital asset for more than one year for gain or loss derived from its sale or exchange to be treated as long-term capital gain or loss. The highest marginal individual income tax rate on
	ordinary income significantly exceeds the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gain applicable to non-corporate taxpayers. The maximum tax rate on long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of Section 1250 property (i.e.,
	depreciable real property) is, to the extent that such gain would have been treated as ordinary income if the property were Section 1245 property, higher than the maximum long-term capital gain rate otherwise applicable. With respect to
	distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends and any retained capital gain that is deemed to be distributed, we may designate (subject to certain limits) whether such a distribution is taxable to our non-corporate shareholders at the
	lower or higher rate. A taxable U.S. shareholder required to include retained long-term capital gains in income will be deemed to have paid, in the taxable year of the inclusion, its proportionate share of the tax paid by us in respect of such
	undistributed net capital gains. Taxable U.S. shareholders subject to these rules will be allowed a credit or a refund, as the case may be, for the tax deemed to have been paid by such shareholders. Taxable U.S. shareholders will increase their
	basis in their shares by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by the taxable U.S. shareholder in respect of such gains. In addition, the characterization of income as capital gain or ordinary income may
	affect the deductibility of capital losses. A non-corporate taxpayer may generally deduct capital losses not offset by capital gains against its ordinary income only up to a maximum annual amount of $3,000. A non-corporate taxpayer may carry forward
	unused capital losses indefinitely. A corporate taxpayer must pay tax on its net capital gain at ordinary corporate rates. A corporate taxpayer can deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused losses being carried back
	three years and forward five years.




	Redemption of Preferred Shares for Cash.


	 The treatment accorded to any redemption
	by us for cash (as distinguished from a sale, exchange or other disposition) of preferred shares can only be determined on the basis of particular facts as to each holder at the time of redemption. As stated above, in general a taxable U.S.
	shareholder of preferred shares will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount received upon the redemption and such holders adjusted tax basis in the preferred shares redeemed (provided the preferred shares
	are held as a capital asset) if such redemption (i) results in a complete termination of the holders interest in all classes of our shares under Section 302(b)(3) of the Code, (ii) is substantially
	disproportionate with respect to the holders interest in our shares under Section 302(b)(2) of the Code (which will not be the case if only preferred shares are redeemed, since they generally do not have voting rights), or
	(iii) is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the holder of preferred shares under Section 302(b)(1) of the Code. In applying these tests, there must be taken into account not only the preferred shares owned
	by the taxable U.S. shareholder, but also such holders ownership of our common shares and any other options (including share purchase rights) to acquire any of the foregoing. The holder of preferred shares also must take into account any such
	securities (including options) which are considered to be owned by such holder by reason of the constructive ownership rules set forth in Sections 318 and 302(c) of the Code.


	If a particular taxable U.S. shareholder of preferred shares owns (actually or constructively) none of our common shares or an insubstantial
	percentage of our outstanding common shares, then based upon current law, it is probable that the redemption of preferred shares from such a holder would be considered not essentially equivalent to a dividend. However, whether a dividend
	is not essentially equivalent to a dividend depends on all of the facts and circumstances, and a taxable U.S. shareholder of preferred shares intending to rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption should consult the
	holders own tax advisor to determine their application to the holders particular situation. If the redemption does not meet any of the tests under Section 302 of the Code, then the redemption proceeds received from the preferred
	shares will be treated as a distribution on the preferred shares. If the redemption is taxed as a dividend, the taxable U.S. shareholders adjusted tax basis in the preferred shares will be transferred to any other shares held by the holder. If
	the holder of preferred shares owns none of our other shares, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.


	Under proposed Treasury regulations, if any portion of the amount received by a taxable U.S. shareholder on a redemption of our preferred
	shares is treated as a distribution with respect to our shares but not as a taxable dividend, then such portion will be allocated to all shares held by the taxable U.S. shareholder just before the redemption on a pro rata, share-by-share, basis. The
	amount applied to each share will first reduce the taxable U.S.


	 


	39






	Table of Contents



	shareholders basis in that share and any excess after the basis is reduced to zero will result in taxable gain. If the holder has different basis in its shares, then the amount allocated
	could reduce some of the basis in certain shares while reducing all the basis and giving rise to taxable gain in others. Thus the taxable U.S. shareholder could have gain even if the holders basis in all its shares exceeded such portion. The
	proposed Treasury regulations permit the transfer of basis in the redeemed shares of the preferred shares to the taxable U.S. shareholders remaining, unredeemed preferred shares (if any), but not to any other class of shares held (directly or
	indirectly) by the taxable U.S. shareholder. Instead, any unrecovered basis in the preferred shares would be treated as a deferred loss to be recognized when certain conditions are satisfied. The proposed Treasury regulations would be effective for
	transactions that occur after the date the regulations are published as final Treasury regulations. There can, however, be no assurance as to whether, when and in what particular form such proposed Treasury regulations will ultimately be finalized.
	We urge you to consult your tax advisor concerning the treatment of a cash redemption of our preferred shares.




	Redemption or
	Conversion of Preferred Shares to Common Shares.


	 Assuming that preferred shares will not be redeemed or converted at a time when there are distributions in arrears, in general, no gain or loss will be recognized for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes upon the redemption or conversion of our preferred shares at the option of the holder solely into common shares. The basis that a taxable U.S. shareholder will have for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the common shares received will
	be equal to the adjusted basis the holder had in the preferred shares so redeemed or converted and, provided that the preferred shares were held as a capital asset, the holding period for the common shares received will include the holding period
	for the preferred shares redeemed or converted. A holder, however, will generally recognize gain or loss on the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional common share in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
	holders adjusted basis in such fractional share.


	If a redemption or conversion occurs when there is a dividend arrearage on the
	preferred shares and the fair market value of the common shares exceeds the issue price of the preferred shares, a portion of the common shares received might be treated as a dividend distribution taxable as ordinary income.


	If, pursuant to the terms of a class of preferred shares, a taxable U.S. shareholder receives alternative consideration such as cash,
	securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) in lieu of common shares in connection with the conversion of the taxable U.S. shareholders preferred shares, the tax treatment of the receipt of any such other
	consideration will depend on the nature of the consideration and the structure of the transaction that gives rise to the right to receive such alternative consideration, and it may be a taxable exchange. Taxable U.S. shareholders converting their
	preferred shares should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of any such conversion and of the ownership and disposition of the consideration received upon any such conversion.




	Adjustments to Conversion Price.


	 Under Section 305 of the Code, holders of preferred shares may be deemed to have
	received a constructive distribution of shares that is taxable as a dividend where the conversion ratio is adjusted to reflect a cash or property distribution with respect to the common shares into which it is convertible. An adjustment to the
	conversion price made pursuant to a

	bona fide

	, reasonable adjustment formula that has the effect of preventing dilution of the interest of the holders, however, will generally not be considered to result in a constructive distribution of
	shares. Certain of the possible adjustments that may be provided in issuances of our preferred shares may not qualify as being pursuant to a

	bona fide

	, reasonable adjustment formula. In such a case, if a nonqualifying adjustment were made,
	the holders of preferred shares might be deemed to have received a taxable stock dividend.




	Passive Activity and Investment Income
	Limitations.


	Distributions from us and gain from the disposition of our common or preferred shares will not be treated as passive activity income and, therefore, taxable U.S. shareholders will not be able to apply any passive activity losses
	against such income. Dividends from us (to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital or capital gain dividends) and, on an elective basis, capital gain dividends and gain from the disposition of common or preferred shares generally will
	be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment income limitation.




	Medicare Tax on Unearned Income.


	Certain
	taxable U.S. shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on all or a portion of their net investment income, which may include all or a portion of their dividends on our common or preferred
	shares and net gains from the taxable disposition of their shares. Taxable U.S. shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to any of their income or gains in
	respect of our common or preferred shares.

	Current Tax Rates.


	 The maximum tax rate on the long-term capital gains of
	domestic non-corporate taxpayers is 20%. The maximum tax rate on qualified dividend income is the same as the capital gains rate, and is substantially lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income. Because, as a REIT, we are not
	generally subject to tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gains distributed to our shareholders, our distributions are not generally eligible for the tax rate on qualified dividend income. As a result, our ordinary REIT
	distributions are taxed at the higher tax rates applicable to ordinary income. However, with respect to non-corporate taxpayers, the lower qualified dividend income/capital gains tax rate (at a maximum of 20%) does generally apply to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a shareholders long-term capital gain, if any, recognized on the disposition of our shares;




	 




	 


	


	 


	distributions we designate as long-term capital gain dividends (except to the extent attributable to real estate depreciation, in which case the 25% tax rate applies);




	 




	 


	


	 


	distributions attributable to dividends we receive from non-REIT corporations (including our taxable REIT subsidiaries); and




	 




	 


	


	 


	distributions to the extent attributable to income upon which we have paid corporate tax (for example, the tax we would pay if we distributed less than all of our taxable REIT income).




	In general, to qualify for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, a shareholder must hold our shares for more than 60 days during
	the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60 days before the date on which our shares become ex-dividend.




	Information
	Reporting and Backup Withholding.


	 Taxable U.S. shareholders that are exempt recipients (such as corporations) generally will not be subject to U.S. backup withholding and related information reporting on payments of
	dividends on, and the proceeds from the disposition of, our common or preferred shares unless, when required, they fail to demonstrate their status as exempt recipients. In general, we will report to our other shareholders and to the IRS the amount
	of distributions we pay during each calendar year, and the amount of tax we withhold, if any. Under the backup withholding rules, a shareholder may be subject to backup withholding (currently at the rate of 28%) with respect to dividends unless such
	holder (1) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (2) provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and
	otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A shareholder who does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. In addition, we may be
	required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any shareholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status to us. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be credited against a shareholders regular U.S. federal
	income tax liability or refunded by the IRS provided that the shareholder provides the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.



	Taxation of
	Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders



	Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual
	retirement accounts and annuities (exempt organizations), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). While many investments in
	real estate generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the exempt employee pension trust does not otherwise use the shares of
	the REIT in an unrelated trade or business of the pension trust. Based on that ruling, amounts that we distribute to exempt organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an exempt organization were to finance its acquisition of
	shares with debt, a portion of the income that they receive from us would constitute UBTI pursuant to the debt-financed property rules. Furthermore, social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit
	trusts and qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9), (17), and (20), respectively, of Code Section 501(c) are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize
	distributions that they receive from us as UBTI unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares.
	Finally, in certain circumstances, a qualified employee pension or profit sharing trust that owns more than 10% of our shares is required to treat a percentage of


	 


	41






	Table of Contents



	the dividends that it receives from us as UBTI (the UBTI Percentage). The UBTI Percentage is equal to the gross income we derive from an unrelated trade or business (determined as if
	we were a pension trust) divided by our total gross income for the year in which we pay the dividends. The UBTI rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of our shares only if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the UBTI Percentage is at least 5%;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the 5/50 Rule that allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding our shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust;
	and




	 




	 


	


	 


	we are a pension-held REIT (i.e., either (1) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our shares or (2) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of our
	shares collectively owns more than 50% of the value of our shares).




	Tax-exempt entities will be subject to the rules
	described above, under the heading  Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders concerning the inclusion of our designated undistributed net capital gains in the income of our shareholders. Thus, such entities will, after satisfying
	filing requirements, be allowed a credit or refund of the tax deemed paid by such entities in respect of such includible gains.



	Taxation of Non-U.S.
	Shareholders



	The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of non-U.S. shareholders (defined below) are complex. This section is
	only a summary of such rules. We urge non-U.S. shareholders to consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of the U.S. federal, state, and local income tax laws on ownership of our common or preferred shares, including any reporting
	requirements. As used herein, the term non-U.S. shareholder means any taxable beneficial owner of our shares (other than a partnership or entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a taxable
	U.S. shareholder or exempt organization.




	Ordinary Dividends.


	 A non-U.S. shareholder that receives a distribution that
	is not attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests (as defined below) and that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend or retained capital gain will recognize ordinary income to the extent that
	we pay such distribution out of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. A withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution ordinarily will apply to such distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates
	the tax. Under some treaties, however, rates below 30% that are applicable to ordinary income dividends from U.S. corporations may not apply to ordinary income dividends from a REIT or may apply only if the REIT meets certain additional conditions.
	However, if a distribution is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholders conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained
	by the non-U.S. shareholder), the non-U.S. shareholder generally will be subject to federal income tax on the distribution at graduated rates, in the same manner as taxable U.S. shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions (and also may
	be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a non-U.S. shareholder that is a non-U.S. corporation unless the tax is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty). We plan to withhold U.S. income tax at the rate of 30% on the
	gross amount of any such distribution paid to a non-U.S. shareholder unless (i) a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. shareholder timely provides an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to us evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate, or
	(ii) the non-U.S. shareholder timely provides an IRS Form W-8ECI to us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.




	Return of Capital


	. A non-U.S. shareholder will not incur tax on a distribution to the extent it exceeds our current and
	accumulated earnings and profits if such distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of its common or preferred shares. Instead, such distribution in excess of earnings and profits will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares. A non-U.S.
	shareholder will be subject to tax to the extent a distribution exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the adjusted basis of its common or preferred shares, if the non-U.S. shareholder otherwise would be subject to tax on
	gain from the sale or disposition of its shares, as described below. Because we generally cannot determine at the time we make a distribution whether or not the distribution will exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, we normally
	will withhold tax on the entire amount of any distribution just as we would withhold on a dividend. However, a non-U.S. shareholder may obtain a refund of amounts that we withhold if we later determine that a distribution in fact exceeded our
	current and accumulated earnings and profits.


	 


	42






	Table of Contents



	If we are treated as a United States real property holding corporation, we will be
	required to withhold 10% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Consequently, although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30% on the entire amount of any distribution, to the extent we do not do so, we may
	withhold at a rate of 10% on any portion of a distribution not subject to withholding at a rate of 30%.




	Capital Gain
	Dividends.


	 Provided that a particular class of our shares is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States, and the non-U.S. shareholder does not own more than 5% of the shares of such class at
	any time during the one-year period preceding the distribution, then amounts distributed with respect to those shares that are designated as capital gains from our sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests (defined below) are treated as
	ordinary dividends taxable as described above under  Ordinary Dividends.


	If the foregoing exception does not apply, for
	example because the non-U.S. shareholder owns more than 5% of the relevant class of our shares, or because our shares are not regularly traded on an established securities market, the non-U.S. shareholder will incur tax on distributions that are
	attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA). The term U.S. real property interests includes certain
	interests in real property and stock in corporations at least 50% of whose assets consists of interests in real property, but excludes mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. shareholder is taxed on distributions
	attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property interests as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business of the non-U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. shareholder thus would be taxed on such a distribution at the normal capital gain
	rates applicable to taxable U.S. shareholders (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of a nonresident alien individual). A corporate non-U.S. shareholder may also be subject to the 30% branch
	profits tax unless the tax is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. We must withhold 35% of any distribution that we could designate as a capital gain dividend. However, if we make a distribution and later designate it as a
	capital gain dividend, then (although such distribution may be taxable to a non-U.S. shareholder) it is not subject to withholding under FIRPTA. Instead, we must make-up the 35% FIRPTA withholding from distributions made after the designation, until
	the amount of distributions withheld at 35% equals the amount of the distribution designated as a capital gain dividend. A non-U.S. shareholder may receive a credit against its FIRPTA tax liability for the amount we withhold.


	Distributions to a non-U.S. shareholder that we designate at the time of distribution as capital gain dividends which are not attributable to
	or treated as attributable to our disposition of a U.S. real property interest generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, except as described below under  Sale of Shares.




	Retention of Net Capital Gains.


	Although the law is not clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we designate as retained
	capital gains in respect of our shares held by shareholders generally should be treated with respect to non-U.S. shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions by us of capital gain dividends. Under this approach, a non-U.S. shareholder
	would be able to offset as a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability resulting from its proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains, and to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent of the non-U.S.
	shareholders proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds its actual U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the non-U.S. shareholder furnishes required information to the IRS on a timely basis. If we were to designate any
	portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain, a non-U.S. shareholder should consult its tax advisor regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain.




	Sale of Shares


	. A non-U.S. shareholder generally will not incur tax under FIRPTA on gain from the sale of its common or
	preferred shares as long as we are a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period non-U.S. persons held, directly or indirectly, less than 50%
	in value of our shares. We anticipate that we will continue to be a domestically controlled REIT, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be so. However, even if we are not, or cease to be, a domestically controlled REIT, a non-U.S.
	shareholder that owns, actually or constructively, 5% or less of a class of our of outstanding shares at all times during a specified testing period will not incur tax under FIRPTA on a sale of such shares if shares of such class are regularly
	traded on an established securities market. If neither of these exceptions were to apply, the gain on the sale of the common or preferred shares would be taxed under FIRPTA, in which case a non-U.S. shareholder would be required to file a U.S.
	federal income tax return and would be taxed in generally the same manner as taxable U.S. shareholders with respect to such gain (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
	individuals), and if the shares sold were not regularly traded on an established securities market or we were not a domestically-controlled REIT, the purchaser of the shares may be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.


	 


	43






	Table of Contents



	A non-U.S. shareholder will incur tax on gain not subject to FIRPTA if (1) the gain is
	effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholders U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. shareholder), in which case the
	non-U.S. shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as taxable U.S. shareholders with respect to such gain, or (2) the non-U.S. shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the
	taxable year, in which case the non-U.S. shareholder will incur a 30% tax on his capital gains. Capital gains dividends not subject to FIRPTA will be subject to similar rules. A non-U.S. shareholder that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes and has effectively connected income (as described in the first point above) may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional branch profits tax, which is generally imposed on a foreign corporation on the deemed
	repatriation from the United States of effectively connected earnings and profits, at a 30% rate, unless the rate is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty.




	Wash Sales.


	In general, special wash sale rules apply if a shareholder owning more than 5% of our common or preferred shares
	avoids a taxable distribution of gain recognized from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests by selling our shares before the ex-dividend date of the distribution and then, within a designated period, enters into an option or contract
	to acquire shares of the same or a substantially identical class of our shares. If a wash sale occurs, then the seller/repurchaser will be treated as having gain recognized from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests in the same amount
	as if the avoided distribution had actually been received. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult their own tax advisors on the special wash sale rules that apply to non-U.S. shareholders.




	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.


	 We must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. shareholder the
	amount of distributions paid to such holder and the tax withheld with respect to such distributions, regardless of whether withholding was required. Copies of the information returns reporting such distributions and withholding may also be made
	available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. shareholder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.


	Backup withholding (currently at the rate of 28%) and additional information reporting will generally not apply to distributions to a non-U.S.
	shareholder provided that the non-U.S. shareholder certifies under penalty of perjury that the shareholder is a non-U.S. shareholder, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding may apply if either we or
	our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient. As a general matter, backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of
	common or preferred shares effected at a foreign office of a foreign broker. Information reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of common or preferred shares by a foreign office of a broker
	that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	is a U.S. person;




	 




	 


	


	 


	derives 50% or more of its gross income for a specified three-year period from the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S.;




	 




	 


	


	 


	is a controlled foreign corporation (generally, a foreign corporation controlled by stockholders that are United States persons) for U.S. tax purposes; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	that is a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year more than 50% of its income or capital interests are held by U.S. persons or if it is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S.,




	unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder or beneficial owner is a non-U.S. shareholder and
	certain other conditions are met, or the shareholder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of common or preferred shares effected at a U.S. office of a broker is subject to both backup withholding and information
	reporting unless the shareholder certifies under penalty of perjury that the shareholder is a non-U.S. shareholder, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and may be credited against a non-U.S.
	shareholders U.S. federal income tax liability or refunded to the extent excess amounts are withheld, provided that the required information is timely supplied to the IRS.

	Reporting and Withholding on Foreign Financial Accounts.


	Certain foreign financial
	institutions and non-financial foreign entities are subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax on dividends on our common or preferred shares unless (i) in the case of a foreign financial institution (which term generally includes investment
	funds), such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government (unless alternative procedures apply pursuant to an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the relevant foreign government) to withhold on
	certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account
	holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) and to withhold on certain payments, and (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign entity, such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying any direct and indirect
	U.S. owners of the entity. In addition, if such disclosure requirements are not satisfied, withholding at a 30% rate on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common or preferred shares by such foreign financial institutions and
	non-financial foreign entities will generally begin after December 31, 2016 (or such other date as may be specified in guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department). Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. shareholder might be eligible for
	refunds or credits of such taxes. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding provisions on the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common or preferred shares. We will
	not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld.



	Other Tax Considerations





	State and Local Taxes.


	 We and/or you may be subject to state and local tax in various states and localities, including those
	states and localities in which we or you transact business, own property or reside. The state and local tax treatment in such jurisdictions may differ from the federal income tax treatment described above. Consequently, you should consult your tax
	advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws upon an investment in our securities.

	PLAN OF
	DISTRIBUTION



	We may sell the securities being offered by this prospectus in one or more of the following ways from time to time:
	(1) through underwriters or dealers; (2) through agents; (3) in at the market offerings to or through a market maker or into an existing trading market or securities exchange or otherwise; (4) directly to purchasers
	or shareholders, (5) through a combination of any of these methods of sale or (6) through any other legally available means. In addition, the sales will be made at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such
	prevailing market prices, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed or at negotiated prices. We will identify any underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer and sale of securities, and any applicable commissions, discounts and other
	items constituting compensation to such underwriters, dealers or agents, in a prospectus supplement.


	The methods by which we may
	distribute securities include:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a block trade (which may involve crosses) in which the dealer so engaged will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	purchases by a dealer as principal and resale by such dealer for its account pursuant to this prospectus or any prospectus supplement;




	 




	 


	


	 


	ordinary broker transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other legally available means.




	Unless we say otherwise in a prospectus supplement, the
	obligations of any underwriters to purchase securities will be subject to certain conditions and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of the applicable securities if any are purchased. If a dealer is used in a sale, we may sell the
	securities to the dealer as principal. The dealer may then resell the securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale.


	In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters or agents may receive compensation (in the form of discounts, concessions or
	commissions) from us or from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agents. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions, that may
	be in excess of those customary in the types of transactions involved, from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agents. Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of securities
	may be deemed to be underwriters as that term is defined in the Securities Act, and any discounts or commissions received by them from us and any profits on the resale of the securities by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and
	commissions under the Securities Act. We will identify any such underwriter or agent, and we will describe any such compensation we pay, in the related prospectus supplement.


	Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements with us, to indemnification against and contribution toward certain civil
	liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.


	If we tell you in a prospectus supplement, we will authorize agents and
	underwriters to solicit offers by certain specified institutions or other persons to purchase securities at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on
	a specified date in the future. Institutions with whom such contracts may be made include commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, educational and charitable institutions, and other institutions but
	shall in all cases be subject to our approval. Such contracts will be subject only to those conditions set forth in the prospectus supplement and the prospectus supplement will set forth the commission payable for solicitation of such contracts. The
	obligations of any purchaser under any such contract will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities shall not be prohibited at the time of delivery under the laws of the jurisdiction to which the purchaser is subject. The
	underwriters and other agents will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of such contracts.


	The
	securities may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market (other than the common shares, which are quoted on the New York Stock Exchange). No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the
	trading market for any such securities.


	If underwriters or dealers are used in the sale, until the distribution of the securities is
	completed, SEC rules may limit the ability of any such underwriters and selling group members to bid for and purchase the securities. As an


	 


	46






	Table of Contents



	exception to these rules, representatives of any underwriters are permitted to engage in certain transactions that stabilize the price of the securities. Such transactions may consist of bids or
	purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the securities. If the underwriters create a short position in the securities in connection with the offerings (in other words, if they sell more securities than are set forth
	on the cover page of the prospectus supplement) the representatives of the underwriters may reduce that short position by purchasing securities in the open market. The representatives of the underwriters may also elect to reduce any short position
	by exercising all or part of any over-allotment option described in the prospectus supplement. The representatives of the underwriters may also impose a penalty bid on certain underwriters and selling group members. This means that if the
	representatives purchase securities in the open market to reduce the underwriters short position or to stabilize the price of the securities, they may reclaim the amount of the selling concession from the underwriters and selling group members
	who sold those securities as part of the offering. In general, purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such
	purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of the securities to the extent that it discourages resales of the securities. We make no representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect
	that the transactions described above may have on the price of the securities. In addition, the representatives of any underwriters may determine not to engage in such transactions and such transactions, once commenced, may be discontinued without
	notice.


	Certain of the underwriters or agents and their affiliates may engage in transactions with and perform services for us or our
	affiliates in the ordinary course of their respective businesses.

	The validity of the offered securities and the accuracy of the discussion under Material Federal Income Tax
	Considerations contained in this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, Washington D.C. If any portion of the offered securities is distributed in an underwritten offering or through agents, certain legal
	matters may be passed upon for any agents or underwriters by counsel for such agents or underwriters identified in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	We have filed with the SEC a registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, with respect to the securities to be offered by this
