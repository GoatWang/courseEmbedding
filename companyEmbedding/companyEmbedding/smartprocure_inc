It’s the purchase orders that tell the WHOLE story.



  

The U.S. government spends $7 trillion per year. Eighty percent of that spending does not go out for public bid. 80%! However, the one place that you can see all of the details of an agency’s spending is on their purchase orders. 
Purchase orders identify specific sellers, product and service descriptions, quantities, prices, discounts, payment terms, dates and other details. The power comes in bringing all of that information together in one database and making it easily searchable for government vendors. 
SmartProcure aggregates hundreds of millions of purchase orders from schools, local, state and federal agencies so that businesses that sell into the government can easily see who buys their products, how much they pay and who they purchase them from. Thousands of businesses and government sales managers use SmartProcure to effortlessly find new customers and use pricing intelligence to increase their government wins.

Other government buyers who are doing amazing things with SmartProcure:
















  

"There's a huge variation in pricing when it comes to government purchases. A laser jet printer, for example, can be sold to one government department for $800 and an identical model to another for half that price. SmartProcure's software pulls the disparate details from millions of government purchase orders into a central database that both the agency and the hopeful vendor can search via a Web interface."
By Jeremy Quittner, Staff Writer, Inc.



  

"The Big Apple, which has a $70 billion annual budget, would save more than $100 million annually if it can use the service to cut procurement costs by just 1 percent," New York City Comptroller John Liu said in a statement. "Knowing exactly what prices vendors offer other governments will help city agencies negotiate the best possible deals for taxpayers," Liu said."
By Hilary Russ, Reporter, Reuters



  

"[SmartProcure] operates as a searchable database of government procurement information, allowing users to find a whole range of past deals, from how much Jefferson City, Mo., paid for its printers to the most recent contract won by McLean-based Science Applications International Corp."

One of the things Ripoff Report learned in the course of its review is that typical customer feedback reads, "SmartProcure, Inc. provides both an excellent service and a helpful team of product experts to give customers the best experience possible."Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.. The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Jim Finolio during an onsite inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases towards SmartProcure.

SmartProcure collects purchasing data from electronic versions of purchase orders and from thousands of governmental agencies of all sizes throughout the country. They then put that information into one big database, which is researchable with a Google-type search engine on top of it.  subscribers can search that database and they can find out what government agencies are buying, the kinds of things they sell, and what prices they pay. Likewise, they can see what kind of business their competitors are doing. Jim Finolio stated the following about his company, "what we add is a huge degree of transparency to the federal marketplace. So our overarching goal is to make government purchasing very effective and efficient for government agencies, and help the businesses who sell to the government expand their markets and be as successful as they can be with this kind of information." 

Leads for SmartProcure are obtained through their own database in addition to industry lists who sell to the government. Mr. Finolio went on to explain that SmartProcure's clients are nearly 100% business to business. An interested client call call in or inquire about their services Online.

During the on-site interview, Mr. Finolio was asked to describe a situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received. Mr. Finolio stated the following, "I ran into a case where I signed a check for a refund recently...the client found that there wasn’t enough information that the client felt was relevant to their industry in the database. And I would say as we add more and more information, that’s exceedingly rare, but historically that’s happened." Clients have expressed great satisfaction with the manner in which SmartProcure deals with complaints. 

When asked to comment on complaints posted on Ripoff Report's website Mr. Finolio processed through each complaint on the website and found that each was either a false claim, or have been effectively handled by the CEO Jeff Rubenstein. In order to further assure future and current clients SmartProcure has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.

So we’re very eager.

SMARTPROCURE – STATEMENT FROM THE CEO AND FOUNDER – JEFF RUBENSTEIN  " Our mission is to provide the most comprehensive, high-quality government purchasing data; powerful, easy-to-use analytic and reporting tools; and a nationwide information sharing platform to enable easier and more efficient government procurement.

NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SmartProcure Deerfield Beach Florida ABOUT THE RIPOFF REPORT BELOW:  Ripoff Report would like to let readers know that Ripoff Report emailed this customer so the member business could make things right with them. When a business joins the Corporate Advocacy Program, Ripoff Report emails everyone from the past so the member business can make things right with them. Of course, everything within reason. In order to confirm that the complaints were resolved, Ripoff Report is copied on all responses so we can insure that the member business did right by their customer. The author of the Ripoff Report below never responded to our offer to help them.  STATEMENT FROM SMARTPROCURE:  The report was incorrect in that the customer signed a written contract for 3 years of service, including 60 days free service after the first month, and then refused to pay any monthly payments after 90 days -- 60 days of which were free! SmartProcure agreed to waive any responsibility for years 2 and 3 as an accommodation. In all fairness, we believe there is no logical way a customer could assume he could pay for 1 month of service on a clearly documented contract with a 3 year term he signed, and receive another 60 days of free service, without any obligation at all for carrying out his part of the contract. NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED --------------------------------------------------------------------- SmartProcure is supposed to be a searchable database of government purchase orders to help government vendors boost sales. After extremely aggressive sales tactics, I agreed to try the service  on August 24, 2015. as I was clearly told there is no commitment.  Since I was hesitant about any benefits from the service I was not willing to sign up for a long term contract.  I tried their system and found that there were no benefits to my company utilizing them.   In early November I called to cancel my agreement.  After several attempts of them trying to convince me not to cancel they sent me a copy of my signed contract and said I was obligated to pay three years of payments.  On the contract it says one SmartSearch-Annual Subscription   3 yrs for $250.00 monthly.  However I was lead to believe this was locking in the rate for the  3 years, not committing to paying three years worth of service.  No-where on the agreement does it state I am obligated to pay the full term three years.  The only statement on there is regarding renewals, not termination.   I continued to be harassed, trying to convince me why their services were so great and repeatedly sent a copy of my agreement.  Nothing had changed on either end.  Then on March 7, 2016 I received  an email from Dani Carideo that my account was severely over due and I owed $1,000.00.  I responded letting him know that I had closed the account several months ago, that I was not using the services and I had no intention of using them again.  I also reiterated that I had met my financial responsibilities with them.  Again I was sent a copy of my agreement and assurance that they had dedicated client service managers to help us use the service.  Again nothing had changed on either end.   I am now being aggressively contacted by a law firm (as of 3/14/2016) trying to collect over $8,000 they claim I owe them.  This company has unethical business practices and has crafted a purposely ambiguous contract in order to deceive clients into believing there is no commitment, to later attempt to collect an exorbitant amount of money for a service that is mostly useless.      This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 03/15/2016 12:12 PM and is a permanent record located here:

"I reached out to Alex and he is extremely hostile.  He states that he recorded all of our calls, and that the AE promised him there was absolutely no commitment.  He also states that he read the PA which clearly says 3 years, but that nowhere does it read that he would actually be liable for payment.  He is not willing to pay for one year and feels he should not be held responsible for the debt.  I kindly explained that we are extending a more than fair offer by waiving years 2 & 3, but he disagrees."

On Thursday, August 20th, at 1:04pm Eastern time we had our first conversation with Alex.  It was a call that one of our staff made to him to introduce the capabilities of SmartProcure.  A demo was set up for Monday, August 24th, at which point Alex called SmartProcure to see the product.  We logged him into our system through the screensharing application join.me and proceeded to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the product. This was a call that lasted 26 minutes, and at the conclusion of the call he asked to purchase the product.  We sent him a formal agreement via Docusign, at which point he signed the agreement and initialed the terms of service.  As Alex indicated in his post, the document clearly stated it was an Annual Subscription.  Due to him being a small company we allowed him to pay monthly as a special exception.  We typically don't allow that for these reasons. What Alex did not mention was that he also asked for another 2 months for free, which we granted.  He made his first payment on August 24th, 2015, then received another 2 months of service for free, then as he indicated in his post, called to cancel in November after his extra 60 days were up.  I'm at a loss to understand why he didn't think this was even an annual agreement at the least, considering it clearly stated it was an annual agreement for a 3 year term. His position that SmartProcure sent a signed agreement for him to sign that said it was an annual agreement and a 3-year term, so he could lock in the price doesn't make much sense if he also isn't locked in.  What company has a client sign an agreement with that language so the client is protected for 3 years against any price increases, yet they could cancel at anytime.  And why would a company provide 60 days for free at the beginning of the agreement if there was no obligation to continue. I consider myself a reasonable and fair person.  I understand that there can be miscommunications and sometimes there is not a meeting of the minds.  However, when someone takes a position that is so counter to what is reasonable it's difficult to rationalize. In the interest of being fair and reasonable, I plan on asking my folks to contact Alex and waive any responsibility for years 2 and 3.  However, there is no fair basis at which to assume he could pay for 1 month of service on clearly documented annual contract with a 3 year term he signed and receive another 60 days of free service for 1 month's payment without any obligation.

Why a purchase order (PO) database? Because POs include all of the relevant details of each purchase: product descriptions, quantities, pricing, vendor profiles, agency information and much more. Budgets, RFP awards and contracts are all spending projections. POs document actual spending, in detail. SmartProcure makes all of those details easily searchable online and provides powerful analytics to make sense of it all.

Steer clear of this companyConsLong hours, no gratitude from management, NO RAISES, they do not give any type of performance review. You can be fired without knowing why or being given a chance to improve. Since it is a small company (approx 125 employees) there is no growth. If you are female or a person of color you are treated horribly, with no respect. It is owned by one person who micromanages every single aspect of every body's job. And, beware, whenever management feels like it you will be terminated without warning. The CEO rules the company like a dictator of his own little country.Advice to ManagementNone, they will never change.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SmartProcure Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SmartProcure 2017-07-20 04:38 PDT Apr 20, 2017"Great First Sales Job"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Account Executive in Deerfield Beach, FLFormer Employee - Account Executive in Deerfield Beach, FLRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at SmartProcure full-time (More than a year)ProsThe sales team is comprised of people from all walks of life - People starting their careers like myself.

I left the company in February after moving to CA. Free meals were a favorable part of working for SP. The commission structure was quite nice as well.ConsSmartProcure is a young company, so processes are still being ironed out. That can be a con for some people, but I enjoyed being able to contribute ideas to help. Our goals on the sales team were very aggressive so there isn't a lot of downtime during the day.Advice to ManagementKeep growing, but take a step back and correct mistakes made along the way.

                BBB has determined that SmartProcure meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        SmartProcure has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 25 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
