Columbus McKinnon CEO, Timothy T. Tevens, Announces Plans To Retire






GlobeNewswire



Sep 15, 2016 8:45 AM EDT













 




























































 AMHERST, N.Y., Sept. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Columbus McKinnon Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCO), a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, technologies and services, today announced that Timothy T. Tevens, the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer and Director since 1998, has advised the Board of Directors that he will retire once his successor is appointed. He will continue to serve as President and CEO until that time and will help ensure a smooth transition.  Mr. Tevens noted, "The last 18 years at the helm of Columbus McKinnon has been a wonderful and deeply fulfilling experience for me as we have dramatically grown our Company through organic and acquisitive investments. We have built lean operations, established a customer-focused culture and expanded our global reach. Given the strength of the Company, now is an excellent time to work on transitioning my role in an orderly fashion to the next leader." Mr. Ernest R. Verebelyi, Chairman of the Board, in speaking for the entire board, expressed the board's deep appreciation for Tim's leadership and accomplishments, with particular emphasis on his building and nurturing a strong executive team to seamlessly carry through the many initiatives now underway for expansion and growth. On a final note, he conveyed the board's best wishes for Tim in his retirement. The Board of Directors has initiated a search for candidates with the assistance of Korn Ferry. Mr. Tevens concluded, "I am quite proud of the nearly 3,000 associates around the world that work diligently to support our customers and continue on the tradition of safe and productive material handling. I am equally excited about Columbus McKinnon's prospects and our position to be the leader in key technology that advances the material handling industry into the future. It has been an honor to be a part of this 140-year old organization and work closely with such great and dedicated colleagues."
