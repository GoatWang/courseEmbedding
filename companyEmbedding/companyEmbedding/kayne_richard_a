Our main service is providing  Illinois attorney referrals and legal guidance.  In addition to our personalized referrals, Illinoislawyers.com also provides a directory of almost all licensed attorneys in Illinois. The list, which we update daily, includes attorneys who are licensed in Illinois and who are physically in Illinois. The list does not include attorneys who have let their registration lapse or those who are out of state.
You can search by an attorney's first or last name, the name of a law firm, or their city. Each listing should include an attorney's name and the name of their firm, along with their address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, website, and the year they were admitted to practice in Illinois. We also try to include, based on our research, the area of law in which the attorney practices.
The list is a good way to get the contact information for an Illinois attorney or law firm. We want to be clear that this list is completely different and separate from our attorney referral list. The network of attorneys we have created for referrals is a specific list of the Illinois attorneys we know and trust. Our network is made up of attorneys we would hire ourselves if we needed a lawyer. Basically, we have handpicked the attorneys we recommend to you.
If you have any questions related to this list, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Attorney Finder:
There are two ways to find contact information for Illinois lawyers:

Start typing the last name and click on the attorney when you find the one you are looking for.
Enter Attorneys Last Name

Very good copy. This volume collects important recent articles by Richard Kayne, one of the top formal linguists in the world. Although the articles range widely in topic and theme, they hang together in that they illustrate the power of the comparative approach, and that they reinforce Kayne's view that syntax is generally more complex than it first appears. As with other volumes in this series, the audience for the volume will be formal linguists and syntacticians around the world." "Book Description: This volume collects important recent articles by Richard Kayne, one of the top formal linguists in the world. Although the articles range widely in topic and theme, they hang together in that they illustrate the power of the comparative approach, and that they reinforce Kayne's view that syntax is generally more complex than it first appears. As with other volumes in this series, the audience for the volume will be formal linguists and syntacticians around the world. : Review: Kayne's arguments are very carefully and logically presented, moving from one step to the next before reaching often quite surprising conclusions.

(more...)To intentionally destroy, obliterate or strike out records or information in files, computers and other depositories. For example, state law may allow the criminal records of a juvenile offender to be expunged when he reaches the age of majority, to allow him to begin his adult life with a clean record. Or, a company or government agency may routinely expunge out-of-date records to save storage space.

(more...)A court official usually classified as a peace officer (sometimes as a deputy sheriff, or marshal) and usually wearing a uniform. A bailiff's main job is to maintain order in the courtroom. In addition, bailiffs often help court proceedings go smoothly by shepherding witnesses in and out of the courtroom and handing evidence to witnesses as they testify. In criminal cases, the bailiff may have temporary charge of any defendant who is in custody during court proceedings.

(more...)A formal accusation of criminal activity. The prosecuting attorney decides on the charges, after reviewing police reports, witness statements and any other evidence of wrongdoing. Formal charges are announced at an arrested person's arraignment.

(more...)Latin for a 'guilty act.' The actus reus is the act which, in combination with a certain mental state, such as intent or recklessness, constitutes a crime. For example, the crime of theft requires physically taking something (the actus reus) coupled with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the object (the mental state, or mens rea).

(more...)A decision by a judge or jury that a defendant in a criminal case is not guilty of a crime. An acquittal is not a finding of innocence; it is simply a conclusion that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

(more...)Someone who helps another person (known as the principal) commit a crime. Unlike an accessory, an accomplice is usually present when the crime is committed. An accomplice is guilty of the same offense and usually receives the same sentence as the principal. For instance, the driver of the getaway car for a burglary is an accomplice and will be guilty of the burglary even though he may not have entered the building.

(more...)A lawyer who is elected to represent a state government in criminal cases in a designated county or judicial district. A D.A.'s duties typically include reviewing police arrest reports, deciding whether to bring criminal charges against arrested people and prosecuting criminal cases in court. The D.A. may also supervise other attorneys, called Deputy District Attorneys or Assistant District Attorneys. In some states a District Attorney may be called a Prosecuting Attorney, County Attorney or State's Attorney. In the federal system, the equivalent to the D.A. is a United States Attorney. The country has many U.S. Attorneys, each appointed by the President, who supervise regional offices staffed with prosecutors called Assistant United States Attorneys.

SAMPLE LEGAL CASES


People v. Van Schoyck... objection, dismissed the three citations and recharged defendant, in an information, with driving
 with a blood-alcohol content over 0.08, noting in the charge the existence of the
