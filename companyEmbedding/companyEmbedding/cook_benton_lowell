Our quality, service-oriented agency is not only owned and operated by a family, customers tell us we make them feel like family too.One of the things I like best about working with Allstate is the variety of products and services I can offer customers. More than insurance, I can offer a variety of solutions to address their financial needs – such as saving for a child’s education or retirement.As a small business owner, I understand the importance of building a solid foundation for the future and developing long-lasting customer relationships. That’s why I’m committed to offering you the same level of service I’d expect from my own business dealings.

In addition to comparing prices, it's important to compare the coverages that would be provided by each policy. Because the kinds of protections — and how much coverage they'll offer — can vary between policies, you'll likely want to ensure you're making an apples-to-apples comparison as you decide which policy best fits your needs.Learn More More Than Just An Auto PolicyIf you're a safe driver, Allstate thinks you should enjoy some extra perks. That's why we're using Drivewise® technology to measure things like speed, mileage and braking and rewarding you for your safe driving behavior. It won't increase your rates, and you get rewarded just for signing up. I'd love to talk to you about Drivewise® and how you can earn Allstate Rewards℠ points.Learn More Does Renters Insurance Cover a Laptop Computer or Mobile Device?You can be connected just about anywhere these days. You probably don't think much of checking your email in a coffee shop, walking around the office with your laptop computer or even watching a movie on your patio. Whether you're working at the kitchen table or finishing a project in the library, your laptop may go as many places as you do. But did you know that your renters insurance policy may be able to help if your laptop is stolen or damaged? Here are a few things to consider about protecting your laptop.Learn More Term Life Insurance 101Term life insurance can be an affordable way to help protect your loved ones for a set amount of time - typically anywhere from one to 30 years. You'll be covered for the length of the selected term, and your beneficiaries will receive the policy benefit if you should pass away during that time. If you're interested in term insurance, this brief overview is a great place to start. I know that buying life insurance can be a difficult decision, but it is an important one. That's why I’m here to help you choose the best options for you.Learn More Small Business Insurance NeedsYou know the ins and outs of your small business and what it takes to keep things running. But do you know how to help protect the business you've worked so hard to build? From merchandise to machinery to a home-based operation, there are a lot of coverage options available to choose from. This quick rundown of things you'll want to consider when insuring your small business is a great place to start. I know the effort a small business takes, and I'm here to help you protect your life's work.Learn More Cheap Motorcycle Coverage - Worth It?You love the freedom that comes with your motorcycle and the open road, and paying a lot for insurance feels like taking away a bit of that joy. But the truth is that paying less now could mean paying more out of pocket for repairs and medical bills down the road. It's important to have the right coverage, and a cheap motorcycle insurance may not offer you the best protection. Consider these tips and ways to save as your shopping for motorcycle coverage.Learn More Renting A Motorhome?Whether it's for a weekend getaway or a summer touring the country, renting a motorhome can be a great way to travel. While you're researching the motorhome and rental company that are right for your trek, don't forget to look into insurance, too. Your current auto and homeowners policies may offer some coverage for a motorhome rental, but supplemental insurance can be a good idea. Here are the basics on what your policies may cover and why you might want to consider additional insurance before hitting the road.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect. Take a look at this overview of condominium insurance, and then let's make sure you have the coverage you need.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Lowell.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(479) 770-8077(479) 770-8077Mobile(479) 925-0565(479) 925-0565Fax(479) 770-6108(479) 770-6108Email:jeffcook@allstate.comjeffcook@allstate.comAddress:108 Crossover Ave, Ste E1Lowell, AR 72745Get DirectionsAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Springdale, Lowell, Cave Springs, Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Centerton, Garfield, Pea Ridge, Hindsville, Bella Vista, Gentry, Siloam Springs, Decatur, Eureka Springs, Elkins, Wesley, Gravette, Huntsville, Lincoln, Prarie Grove, Summers, Arkansas, NWA, Northwest Arkansas, Ozarks, River Valley, Missouri, Benton County, Washington County.

In addition to comparing prices, it's important to compare the coverages that would be provided by each policy. Because the kinds of protections — and how much coverage they'll offer — can vary between policies, you'll likely want to ensure you're making an apples-to-apples comparison as you decide which policy best fits your needs.Learn More More Than Just An Auto PolicyIf you're a safe driver, Allstate thinks you should enjoy some extra perks.

Whether you're working at the kitchen table or finishing a project in the library, your laptop may go as many places as you do. But did you know that your renters insurance policy may be able to help if your laptop is stolen or damaged? Here are a few things to consider about protecting your laptop.Learn More Term Life Insurance 101Term life insurance can be an affordable way to help protect your loved ones for a set amount of time - typically anywhere from one to 30 years.

Consider these tips and ways to save as your shopping for motorcycle coverage.Learn More Renting A Motorhome?Whether it's for a weekend getaway or a summer touring the country, renting a motorhome can be a great way to travel. While you're researching the motorhome and rental company that are right for your trek, don't forget to look into insurance, too. Your current auto and homeowners policies may offer some coverage for a motorhome rental, but supplemental insurance can be a good idea. Here are the basics on what your policies may cover and why you might want to consider additional insurance before hitting the road.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect.

COOK, LOWELL E.

By Bluebag Media -   August 16, 2016 



0SHARESShareTweetSubscribe


Lowell Eugene Cook, 80, of Bradford, passed away Saturday, August 6, 2016 at his home.  Lowell was born in Grand Rapids, MI on January 16, 1936 to the (late) Jesse J. & Edith (Bowman) Cook.
He received his Bachelors Degree in Mathematics from Manchester University and was a teacher at Edison Community College. He was also a farmer and a member of the Pleasant Hill Church of the Brethren, where he was active in Sunday School and loved to sing in the choir.
He was preceded in death by his parents; wife of 57 years, Ruth Anna (Snider) Cook in 2015; and brother, Delbert Cook.
Lowell is survived by his four children and their spouses, Benton & Lisa Cook of Lebanon, Celia & Daniel Cook-Huffman of Huntingdon, PA, Nathan & Noreen Cook of Bradford, Melonya Cook of Bradford; nine grandchildren, Josh & Caroline, Hanna, Jesse, Grace, Ethan, Ely, Elliot, Melaina, Madisyn; great-grandson, Josiah; sister, Evelyn Murdoch of Arkansas; and other relatives and friends.
Lowell will be remembered by friends and family from his home state of Michigan, and from his community in Ohio for his beautiful singing voice, his humor, and his commitment to community. The earth was his partner in work and in play. He farmed for most of his life, growing strawberries, melons and pumpkins, among other crops. He loved to camp and canoe, exploring rivers and lakes across the Midwest. He taught by example, living out his belief that we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves, and there are no limits on who counts as your neighbor. Husband, father, friend, neighbor – his daily presence will be deeply missed, his legacy not forgotten.
The Memorial Service will be held Saturday, August 27, at 5 p.m. at Pleasant Hill Church of the Brethren with Pastor Nick Beam officiating.  If desired, memorial contributions may be made to Hospice of Miami County or Heifer International.  Condolences may be left for the family at www.stockerfraley.com.
