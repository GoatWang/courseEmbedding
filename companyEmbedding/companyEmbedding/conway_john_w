      ■ John W. Conway became the CEO of Crown Cork & Seal in
      early 2001. The company was later established as Crown Holdings in 2003.
      In 2001, however, he faced a series of challenges in placing the
      century-old bottling and packaging company on a stronger financial basis.
      In addition to dealing with a recession coupled with rising prices for raw
      materials, energy, and transportation, Crown had to contend with the
      possibility of bankruptcy due to asbestos-related court claims.
      Conway's approach to strengthening the company's financial
      foundation combined aggressive cost cutting and conservative expansion.
    

      EDUCATION AND EARLY CAREER
    

      Conway graduated from the University of Virginia and then earned a law
      degree from Columbia Law School. He went on to hold a series of management
      positions both in the United States and abroad with the Continental Can
      International Corporation, a metal can manufacturing company, before he
      became Continental's president. Crown Cork & Seal Company
      acquired Continental Can in 1991.
    

      Conway joined Crown's board of directors in 1997 and became the
      company's president and chief operating officer the following year.
      He assumed the position of CEO in January 2001 after the retirement of his
      predecessor, William J. Avery. A press release reprinted by PR Newswire
      quoted Avery as saying, "With John Conway's experience and
      his leadership abilities so clearly demonstrated, I think this is the time
      for me to step aside and let John and his management team guide this great
      company" (November 14, 2000). A few months later, Conway also
      succeeded Avery as chairman of the board.
    

      CROWN FACES BANKRUPTCY
    

      Conway took charge of Crown just as an economic slowdown began to affect
      the company. Ranked among the two hundred largest companies headquartered
      in the United States, Crown was the leading supplier of packaging products
      to consumer marketing companies around the world. In spite of the
      company's market share, however, its stock performance deteriorated
      as its packaging business slumped.
    

      Conway decided to use a conservative financial strategy while improving
      the company's balance sheet. His strategic plan included a heavy
      emphasis on cost structure and positioning Crown as a low-cost producer.
      Conway's cost-cutting measures included the closing of 10 plants in
      North America and Europe and the reduction of Crown's salaried work
      force. He also realigned the production capacity of Crown's plant
      in Weston, Ontario. The Canadian plant converted two of its existing four
      aluminum beverage can lines to the manufacture of two-piece steel food
      cans, thus substantially reducing its beverage can capacity. PR Newswire
      quoted Conway as saying, "Converting underutilized manufacturing
      capacity … will help capture sales for our Food Can Division and at
      the same time trim capacity in the beverage can industry" (February
      27, 2001).
    

      THE ASBESTOS CRISIS
    

      In addition to a slow economy, the major challenge facing Conway and Crown
      was the threat of asbestos-related litigation. The lawsuits were related
      to Crown's 1963 purchase of a company called Mundet, which had
      produced cork bottle caps in addition to insulation that contained
      asbestos. Crown was interested only in Mundet's bottle division and
      sold off its insulation business 93 days after it had purchased Mundet.
    

      Nevertheless, Crown eventually paid dearly for its brief period of
      ownership, paying out millions of dollars by mid-2001 to settle some
      70,000 asbestos-related claims. As industry analysts observed, other large
      companies involved in these cases such as Owens Corning and Armstrong
      Holdings were forced to declare bankruptcy, causing a ripple effect that
      left the remaining companies like Crown facing an increased share of
      liability payments.
    

      Settling the legal claims eventually put Crown on the verge of bankruptcy.
      Conway had the company suspend its quarterly dividend in order to set
      aside money for payouts. The combination of legal claims and packaging
      business problems led to the company's stock falling over the
      course of a year from $36 per share to $4 per share by April 2001. The
      legal difficulties were mitigated in December 2001, when the governor of
      Pennsylvania signed a law limiting the asbestos-related liabilities of
      Crown and other Pennsylvania-based companies. Conway thought that the
      General Assembly and the governor had made the right decision, saying,
      "Crown does not discount the problem of serious asbestos-related
      disease, but rather sees the new legislation as a demonstration of
      fundamental fairness in allocating liability" (PR Newswire,
      December 17, 2001).
    

      CROWN GOES GLOBAL
    

      While dealing with the asbestos crisis, Conway sought out new markets for
      Crown as part of his strategy for maintaining the company's global
      presence. He oversaw the opening of the first beverage can production
      facility in Seville, Spain, as part of Crown's efforts to meet
      steadily increasing market demand in Europe. Conway also signed a
      long-term agreement to supply Nestlé Russia with cans for
      Nescafé products. In an interview with a reporter from 
      
        Beverage Industry
      
      , Conway remarked, "Crown is committed to supporting customers
      throughout Europe" (October 2002).
    

      By the end of 2002, Conway was able to report that the company was on
      track with its 24-to-30-month plan for achieving profitability.
      Crown's operating income in 2002 had increased 53 percent to $481
      million. Its net income from continuing operations was $0.49 per share
      compared to a $0.74 per share in 2001. Conway had also increased the
      company's free cash flow to $300 million from $142 million.
    

      LOOKING AHEAD
    

      Conway continued to focus on reducing Crown's costs while improving
      the productivity of its operations and taking a careful and conservative
      approach to investing. He also remained committed to debt reduction. Crown
      reported losses of 33 cents a share for the fourth quarter of 2003, which
      was an improvement from the $1.71-per-share loss it had reported in the
      fourth quarter of 2002. Another good sign was that net sales for the
      quarter were $1.59 billion, up 3 percent from a year earlier.
      Nevertheless, net sales for the year were down to $6.63 billion, 2.4
      percent lower than the previous year's sales.
    

      Although industry analysts remarked that Conway had taken some positive
      steps to putting the company back on track, they also observed that Crown
      was not yet out of the woods. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down
      the state's asbestos reform law in March 2004, which meant that
      Crown was once again faced with paying out higher legal claims at the
      state level and the federal level.
    

      In addition to Conway's duties at Crown Holdings, he also served as
      a director of West Pharmaceutical Services and PPL Corporation.

DEFINITION of 'John W. Conway'
The chairman, president and CEO of Philadelphia-based Crown Holdings, a company that produces metal packaging such as soft drink cans, candy tins and aerosol containers for beauty products and industrial products. When Conway became CEO in 2001, the company had a large market share but a recession was hurting its business. Conway cut costs by closing several of the company's plants. He also oversaw the company's expansion in Vietnam, Cambodia and the Middle East and the sale of its cosmetics packaging business and global plastic closures business. 

BREAKING DOWN 'John W. Conway'
Born in 1945, Conway holds a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School and has also been a board member of PPL and West Pharmaceutical Services. Conway began his career with Continental Can International, which was acquired by Crown Cork & Seal in 1991 and became Crown Holdings in 2003. He became president and COO of Crown in 1991 and CEO and chairman in 2001.

There are requirements of proper and prompt notice to the employer, appropriate medical treatment, including documentation of your injury, and important rules related to work search. Time periods are shorter than other types of injury cases. There are frequent miscalculations made in the level of benefits paid.  It is very important that an experienced person review matters, such as third party actions, permanent impairment ratings, the relationship of the potential work injury to other work and non-work-related medical problems, independent contractor issues, fringe benefit issues, and special cases, such as prior injuries, employer discrimination, and stress-related claims.Employment DiscriminationFor employees: What rights do I have if I am fired? I’ve been treated unfairly – what do I do? I feel that I may have been discriminated against – where do I go and what deadlines do I have to worry about? Although Maine is an at-will state (you can be fired for any reason or no reason as long as it is not an illegal reason), employees have a number of rights ranging from wage and hour protections to civil rights to employment discrimination. Employees often have limited time frames in which to exercise their rights and therefore should act quickly if they think they have an issue. Given the complexity of employment laws, our extensive background in employment law is critical to any employee seeking representation. We can offer both experience as well as humanistic, balanced, and dedicated service.Employment ContractEmployment MAINE REST BREAK LAW In Maine, an employee may not be required to work more than six consecutive hours without a rest break of at least 30 minutes.  26 M.R.S.A. §601.  The break time does not have to be paid time; an employee may be required to “punch out” for his break.  The break is typically used as lunch or other mealtime.  It is common for employers to give shorter breaks during the day, which must be paid if given, but an employer is not required to provide paid breaks. An employee needs to be able to rest and eat without work interruption.  This is particularly important if the rest time is not paid time, as Maine wage and hour laws for hourly-paid employees might deem rest time as “compensable” time, if the employee is not completely relieved from her duties. There are of course several exceptions to the rule.  A collective bargaining agreement (union contract) or other written employment agreement may contain provisions that allow for a different break or mealtime arrangement.  There is also a small business exception in the Maine statute.  The rule does not apply to any place of employment where there are fewer than three employees on duty at a time.  An exception exists for emergency situations “in which there is danger to property, life, public safety or public health.”  The law also carves out an exemption for employers if “the nature of the work done by the employees allows them frequent breaks during their work day.”  If an employee is free to rest, eat, use facilities, etc., during the course of their shift,...Employment LitigationFor employers, an experienced workers compensation attorney is invaluable in assisting a business through an employee injury the process of handling the workers compensation claim and related business and employment issues.  Linnell, Choate & Webber, LLP can also assist with compliance with overlapping employment laws that impact injured workers.Sexual HarassmentFor employers: An employee at my business just hurt themselves outside of work and wants to come back even though we think he’s still injured – what can we do if we don’t think he’s ready to return? An employee got hurt at work and needs a leave of absence and we don’t know if she gets workers’ comp. leave, FMLA leave, ADA leave, or all three. How can we draft a sexual harassment policy that will provide us protection and what is that Maine law requiring training that we heard about?Property LawProperty DamageReal Estate LitigationWhen it comes to real estate law and transactions, LCW has long been a leading firm in the greater Lewiston/Auburn area and throughout central Maine.

Please contact Jack W. Conway for your business or real estate needs.Construction LitigationWhen selecting a mediator to assist with your clients’ construction disputes, an attorney with a strong background in all avenues of construction litigation is advisable. An experienced construction mediator can more efficiently prepare for the mediation without spending time (and your money) learning the basic construction fundamentals. In addition, an attorney who has successfully handled several construction cases over a period of many years can offer insight as to what a court may do with a particular legal position, and/or what obstacles the parties and their lawyers may face at trial.Real Estate TransactionsLand Use and ZoningLandlord-Tenant DisputesHer memberships include the Maine Bar Association, the Androscoggin County Bar Association, and the Maine Trial Lawyers Association.

In 2009, students from Lesley University in Massachusetts filed a charge of discrimination under the ADA, alleging that the university failed to make reasonable accommodations, with respect to meal plans and menu choices, to students with a disability in the form of a food allergy – gluten intolerance.  Gluten is a common food allergy which can manifest into celiac disease in some people.  Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder “that damages the lining of the small intestine and prevents it from absorbing parts of food that are important for staying healthy.  The damage is due to a reaction to eating gluten, which is found in wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats.”  See Celiac Disease Definition, U.S. Nat’l Library of Medicine, Nat’l Inst. of Health, A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia (Jan. 20, 2010), available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001280.  Symptoms of celiac disease vary greatly and can include anything from abdominal pain to seizures.  The condition can also lead to malnutrition.  Other types of food allergies, such...Business and Corporate LawBusiness DisputesConstruction Law Most construction contracts contain mediation clauses, or other dispute resolution clause, setting forth in advance the manner in which disagreements regarding the contract will be addressed. Maine’s Home Construction Contracts Act requires, at a minimum, a statement allowing the parties the option of adopting a method for resolving contract disputes without the time, cost, expense, and uncertainty that comes with litigation. Typically, the statement sets forth a choice between arbitration or mediation. Most standard form construction contracts also contain dispute resolution provisions. In construction cases, many disagreements do not focus on complex legal issues; rather, they involve such issues as workmanship, delay, cost, and strong differences of opinion and expectations. Especially in residential cases, the parties tend to be emotionally charged and frustrated. A well-trained mediator can be a productive neutral force between homeowners, who do not take lightly their investment in a significant asset (their home), and contractors, who do not appreciate their workmanship being called into question. Both parties tend to want to put the matter behind them; a properly run mediation session can drive them toward this common goal. Disputes between contractors and their suppliers or subs can also be detrimental in a business sense. In addition to the cost, delay, and bad feelings litigation can foster, important business relationships between the parties can be put at risk. Maine is a small state. A good mediator can help the parties mend fences so that they can continue to support each other in the close-knit Maine construction industry. When selecting a mediator to assist with your clients’ construction disputes, an attorney with a strong background in all...Business TransactionsJohn Conway practices law in the following areas: Business and Commercial Transactions and Litigation, Real Estate Law, Municipal Law, and Landlord/Tenant Law.Limited Liability CompaniesIf you are considering entering into business, you should consult an attorney.

Conway for your business or real estate needs.Construction ContractsConstruction Law Construction Law in Maine:  Here are some legal issues affecting both owners and contractors involved with residential and commercial construction ventures. I.          CONTRACTS A.    Written Construction Contracts. Whether you are having work performed on your home or your business – or performing work on someone else’s home or business – it is important to have a written contract.  In some cases, a written contract is legally required, such as under Maine’s Home Construction Contracts Act, discussed below.  A written contract may not be required by law in certain commercial settings, or where the job is for less than $3,000.  Having a written contract is extremely important, however, in avoiding future disputes, which could otherwise come at the worst possible time – in the middle of an unfinished project.  All parties benefit from the process of negotiating and drafting a contract setting forth the mutual understandings and expectations.  The contract should set forth the specific terms of the project, the timeframe, the scope of the work involved, and the cost and payment obligations.  It should contain dispute resolution provisions, warranty and insurance information, and other project-specific clauses. B.    Insurance Policies.  For contractors and other construction professionals, it is a good idea to evaluate your insurance protection when entering into contracts for construction work.  Speak with your insurance agent about the scope of your coverage, generally, and any project-specific endorsements that might be required.  Be sure you understand your policy limits, exclusions, and deductibles.  Likewise, project owners will want to inquire about insurance coverage before hiring professionals to work on their property.
