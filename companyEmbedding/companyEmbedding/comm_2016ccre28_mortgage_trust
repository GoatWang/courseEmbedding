How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Jan. 14, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $29,520,000ab 
      interest-only class X-E, $29,521,412ab interest-only class X-F, 
      $17,969,000a class H or the $29,521,412 class J.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 49 loans secured by 119 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.027 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      lending, L.P., Jeffries LoanCore LLC, and Ladder Capital Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 78% of the properties by balance and asset 
      summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 87.4% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage Higher than Recent Deals: Fitch Stressed DSCR on the 
      trust-specific debt is 1.10x which is worse than the 2014 and 2015 
      averages for other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 1.19x and 
      1.18x, respectively. Fitch Stressed LTV on the trust-specific debt is 
      113.8%, which is higher than the 2014 and 2015 averages for Fitch-rated 
      deals of 106.2% and 109.3%, respectively.
    

      High Proportion of Interest Only Loans: 40.5% of the loans within the 
      pool are full interest only, including seven of the top 10. This is 
      higher than the average for other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals 
      of 20.1% in 2014 and 23.3% in 2015. 43.8% of the loans in the pool are 
      partial interest only, which is in line with the average for other 
      Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 42.8% in 2014 and 43.1% in 2015. 
      Likewise, the pool is scheduled to pay down by 7.7%, which is less than 
      average when compared to other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 
      12% in 2014 and 11.7% in 2015.
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: Five loans totaling 25.2% of the pool balance 
      are secured by properties receiving a property quality grade of 'A-' or 
      better, including four the top 10 loans (Promenade Gateway, 32 Avenue of 
      the Americas, Netflix HQ 2, and FedEx Brooklyn).
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 16.7% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2016-CCRE28 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      and Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 49 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

�
EXECUTION VERSION
�
MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
This Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement (this �Agreement�), is dated and effective January 27, 2016 between Ladder Capital Finance
LLC, as seller (the �Mortgage Loan Seller�), Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP (�LCFH�),
Series TRS of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP (�TRS�), Series REIT of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP
(�REIT�) and Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation, as purchaser (the �Purchaser�).
The Mortgage Loan
Seller desires to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth below, the commercial, multifamily and, if applicable, manufactured housing mortgage loans
(collectively, the �Mortgage Loans�) identified on the schedule annexed hereto as Exhibit A (the �Mortgage
Loan Schedule�), which, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Equity Inns Portfolio Whole Loan, will refer
only to the Mortgage Note relating to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s ownership interest therein that is to be transferred thereunder.
It is expected that
the Mortgage Loans will be transferred, together with other commercial, multifamily and, if applicable, manufactured housing mortgage
loans (such Mortgage Loans, the �Other Mortgage Loans�) to the COMM 2016-CCRE28 Mortgage Trust, a trust fund
(the �Trust Fund�) to be formed by the Purchaser, the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by a series
of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates (the �Certificates�). The offer and sale of certain classes
of the Certificates (the �Registered Certificates�) will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the �Securities Act�). The Trust Fund will be created and the Certificates will be issued pursuant
to a pooling and servicing agreement, dated as of February 1, 2016 (the �Pooling and Servicing Agreement�),
among the Purchaser, as depositor (in such capacity, the �Depositor�), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as master servicer (in such capacity, the �Master Servicer�), Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank,
National Association, as special servicer (the �Special Servicer�), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as certificate administrator (in such capacity, the �Certificate Administrator�), custodian and paying agent,
Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (in such capacity, the �Operating Advisor�), Park Bridge
Lender Services LLC, as asset representations reviewer (in such capacity, the �Asset Representations Reviewer�),
and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the �Trustee�).
The Purchaser intends
to sell the Registered Certificates to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (�DBS�), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (�CF&Co.�),
CastleOak Securities, L.P. (�CastleOak�), Jefferies LLC (�Jefferies�) and Academy Securities,
Inc. (together with DBS, CF&Co., CastleOak and Jefferies, in their capacities as underwriters, the �Underwriters�)
pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated as of January 27, 2016 (the �Underwriting Agreement�). The Purchaser
intends to sell other Certificates (the �Non-Registered Certificates�) to DBS and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
(together with DBS, in their capacities as initial purchasers, the �Initial Purchasers� and, together with the
Underwriters, the �Principals�) pursuant to a certificate purchase agreement dated as of January 27, 2016 (the
�Certificate Purchase Agreement�). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein have the


�
�
respective meanings
assigned to them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (in effect as of the Closing Date) or, if not defined therein, in the
Indemnification Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2016 (the �Indemnification Agreement�), among the Mortgage
Loan Seller, the Purchaser and the Principals.
Now, therefore, in
consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
Section
1.������Agreement to Purchase.
Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Mortgage Loan Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the
Purchaser upon receipt of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in this Section 1, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase,
the Mortgage Loans. The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on or about February 10, 2016 or such other date
as shall be mutually acceptable to the parties hereto (the �Closing Date�). As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage
Loans will have an aggregate principal balance (the �Aggregate Cut-off Date Balance�), after application of
all payments of principal due thereon on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received, of $82,423,094, subject to a variance
of plus or minus 5.0%. The purchase price of the Mortgage Loans (inclusive of accrued interest and exclusive of the Mortgage Loan
Seller�s share of the costs set forth in Section 9 hereof) (the �Mortgage Loan Purchase Price�)
shall be equal to the amount set forth in (and subject to the adjustments contemplated by) the bill of sale (substantially in the
form of Exhibit F to this Agreement), to be entered into between the Mortgage Loan Seller and the Purchaser in connection
with this Agreement and the issuance of the Certificates (the �Bill of Sale�). On the Closing Date, the Mortgage
Loan Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Depositor an amount equal to the aggregate Interest Deposit Amounts with respect
to the Mortgage Loans, to be deposited by the Depositor into the Distribution Account on behalf of the Mortgage Loan Seller and
for the benefit of the Trust Fund, which Interest Deposit Amount for each such Mortgage Loan represents an amount equal to one
day of interest at the related Net Mortgage Rate on the related Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date of such Mortgage
Loan.
Section
2.�����Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.
(a)	On the Closing
Date, subject only to receipt by the Mortgage Loan Seller of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price, the satisfaction of the other closing
conditions required to be satisfied on the part of Purchaser pursuant to Section 7 and the issuance of the Certificates,
the Mortgage Loan Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and without limiting
Section 4(a) hereof without recourse, all the right, title and interest of the Mortgage Loan Seller from and after the Closing
Date in and to the following property whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising (the �Covered Assets�):
the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, including all rights to payment in respect thereof, which, notwithstanding
the foregoing, includes all interest and principal received or receivable by the Mortgage Loan Seller on or with respect to the
Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date (subject to the proviso in the next sentence), together with all of the Mortgage Loan Seller�s

among the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the Mortgage Loan Seller, (ii) the rights of any related Companion Loan Noteholder
pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, if any, and (iii) any Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement related to a Non-Serviced
Whole Loan, if any. The Purchaser shall be entitled to (and, to the extent received by or on behalf of the Mortgage Loan
Seller, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser) all scheduled
payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date, and all other recoveries of principal and
interest collected thereon after the Cut-off Date; provided, however, that all scheduled payments of principal and
interest due on or before the Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off Date shall belong to the Mortgage Loan Seller, and
the Purchaser or its successors or assigns shall promptly remit any such payments to the Mortgage Loan Seller.
With respect to any
Mortgage Loan that is subject to an Intercreditor Agreement, the parties hereto intend that the provisions of this Section 2(a)
serve as an assignment and assumption agreement between the Mortgage Loan Seller (solely as holder of such Mortgage Loan and not
as holder of any related Companion Loan), as the assignor, and the Purchaser, on behalf of the Trust, as the assignee. Accordingly,
the Mortgage Loan Seller hereby (and in accordance with and subject to all other applicable provisions of this Agreement) assigns,
grants, sells, transfers, delivers, sets over, and conveys to the Purchaser all right, title and interest of the Mortgage Loan
Seller in, to and arising out of the related Intercreditor Agreement (solely as holder of such Mortgage Loan and not as holder
of any related Companion Loan) and the Purchaser, on behalf of the Trust, hereby accepts (subject to applicable provisions of this
Agreement) the foregoing assignment and assumes all of the rights and obligations of Mortgage Loan Seller (solely as holder of
such Mortgage Loan and not as holder of any related Companion Loan) with respect to the related Intercreditor Agreement from and
after the Closing Date. In addition, the Purchaser acknowledges that any such Mortgage Loan that is a Serviced Mortgage Loan shall
be serviced pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Within 45 days after
the Closing Date or, without limiting the requirements of the first paragraph of Section 2(d), after such later date on
which the Mortgage Loan Seller has received all the missing filing/recording information, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall, or shall
at the expense of the Mortgage Loan Seller cause a third party vendor (which may be the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Custodian
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or otherwise) to, except in the case of any Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan, (1) complete (to the extent necessary) and submit for recording (in favor of the Trustee in the following form:
�Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of COMM 2016-CCRE28 Mortgage Trust Commercial

behalf of any related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders)) in the appropriate public recording office (a) each Assignment of Mortgage

 Pooling and Servicing Agreement which has not yet been submitted for filing or recording. Each such document
shall reflect that the recorded original should be returned by the public recording office to the Custodian or its designee (or
to the Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee as an alternative) following recording, and each such document shall reflect that
the file copy thereof should be returned to the Custodian or its designee (or to the Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee as an
alternative) following filing; provided that in those instances where the public recording office retains the original
Assignment of Mortgage or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, the Custodian shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain therefrom a certified copy of the recorded original, at the expense of the Depositor. In the event that any
such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the Mortgage
Loan Seller shall promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure or cause the curing of such defect,
as the case may be, and shall thereafter deliver the substitute or corrected document to or at the direction of the Purchaser
(or any subsequent owner
of the affected Mortgage
Loan, including, without limitation, the Trustee)
for recording or filing, as appropriate, at the Mortgage Loan Seller�s expense. In the event that the Mortgage Loan Seller
receives the original recorded or filed copy, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall, or shall cause a third party vendor or any other
party under its control to, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or filed copy (and in no event later than 5 Business
Days following such receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence of filing or recording thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2, in those instances where the public recording office retains the
original Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents
and Profits, if applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations hereunder of the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed
to have been satisfied upon delivery to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage,
Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits.
On the Closing Date,
upon (i) notification from the Mortgage Loan Seller that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in Section 1 has been
received by the Mortgage Loan Seller and (ii) the issuance of the Certificates, the Purchaser shall be authorized to release to
the Certificate Administrator or its designee all of the Mortgage Files in the Purchaser�s possession relating to the Mortgage
Loans.
(b)����������In connection
with the Mortgage Loan Seller�s assignment pursuant to subsection (a) above, and subject to subsections (c)
and (d) below, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with,
the Custodian, on or before the Closing Date, the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and
(xix) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for each Mortgage Loan so assigned (with originals with respect
to clause (i) and copies with respect to clauses (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix)) and, except as otherwise provided in Section 2(d)
below, within 30 days following the Closing Date, the remaining applicable documents required to be included in the Mortgage File
(as defined below) for each such Mortgage Loan, with copies to the Master Servicer; provided that, with respect to a Mortgage
Loan that is included in a Serviced Whole Loan, except for the Mortgage Note referred to in clause (i)(B) of Section 2.01(a) of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, only a single original set of Loan Documents is required to be delivered; provided,
further that with respect to the Equity Inns Portfolio Whole Loan, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall only be required to deliver the
Mortgage Note relating to its

ownership interest
therein that is being transferred hereunder]. With respect to a Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, any assignments
or other transfer documents referred to in the Mortgage File as being in favor of the Trustee shall instead be in favor of the
applicable Other Trustee, and (1) if the Custodian is not also the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan Custodian, the preceding document
delivery requirements will be met by the delivery by or on behalf of the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Custodian of copies of the
documents specified in the Mortgage File (other than the Mortgage Note and intervening endorsements evidencing a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan, with respect to which the originals shall be required), including a copy of the Mortgage securing the applicable
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and copies of the companion notes, or (2) if the Custodian is also the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan
Custodian, the preceding document delivery requirements shall be met by the delivery by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Custodian
of only the original Mortgage Note, intervening endorsements and intercreditor agreement evidencing such Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan (and, if any document specified in the Mortgage File was not required to be delivered in connection with the related Other
Securitization, a copy of such document).
The �Mortgage
File� with respect to each Mortgage Loan means, subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth in
this Agreement and Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the documents and instruments listed in Section 2.01(a)(i)-(xxi)
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
(c)����������If the Mortgage
Loan Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original Mortgage Note, the Mortgage Loan Seller
shall deliver a copy or duplicate original of such Mortgage Note, together with an affidavit certifying that the original thereof
has been lost or destroyed and an indemnification in connection therewith in favor of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee
and the Custodian.
(d)����������If the Mortgage
Loan Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of any of the documents and/or
instruments referred to in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (viii), (xiv) and (xvi) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the UCC financing statements and UCC assignments of financing statements referred to in clause (xiii) of Section
2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, with evidence of recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay caused
by the public recording or filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or because
such original recorded or filed document has been lost or returned from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost, as
the case may be, the delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item,
and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that a copy of such document
or instrument (without evidence of recording or filing thereon, but certified (which certificate may relate to multiple documents
and/or instruments) by the applicable public recording or filing office, by the applicable title insurance company or by the Mortgage
Loan Seller to be a true and complete copy of the original thereof submitted for recording or filing, as the case may be) has been
delivered to the Custodian within 45 days after the Closing Date,
and either the original of such missing document or instrument, or a copy thereof, with evidence of recording or filing, as the
case may be, thereon, is delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan,
including without limitation the Trustee) within 180 days after the Closing Date (or within such longer period after the



-5-

Closing
Date as the Custodian may consent to, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as the
Mortgage Loan Seller has provided the Custodian with evidence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, or has certified
to the Custodian as to the occurrence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, and is, as certified to the Custodian no
less often than quarterly, in good faith attempting to obtain from the appropriate public recording or filing office such original
or copy, provided such extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).
If the Mortgage Loan
Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of the related lender�s
title insurance policy referred to in clause (vii) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement solely because such
policy has not yet been issued, the delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to such missing
item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that the Mortgage
Loan Seller has delivered to the Custodian a binder marked as binding and countersigned by the title insurer or its authorized
agent (which may be a pro forma or specimen title insurance policy which has been accepted or approved in writing as binding by
the related title insurance company) or an acknowledged closing instruction or escrow letter, and the Mortgage Loan Seller shall
deliver to the Custodian or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including
without limitation the Trustee), promptly following the receipt thereof, the original related lender�s title insurance policy
(or a copy thereof).
Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, with respect to the documents referred to in clause (xix) and clause (xx) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, the Mortgage Loan Seller acknowledges that the Master Servicer (or the applicable Other Servicer with
respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) will hold the original of each such document in trust on behalf of the Trustee in order
to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust and the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied the delivery
requirements of this Agreement by delivering the original of each such document to the Master Servicer. The Mortgage Loan Seller
shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment of such letter of credit required (which assignment or amendment shall, except in
the case of a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to the Trust in care of the Master Servicer)
in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust. In the event that the documents specified
in clause (xx) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are missing with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than
a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) because the related assignment or amendment documents have not been completed, the Mortgage Loan
Seller shall take all reasonably necessary steps to enable the Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit on behalf
of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing on the letter of credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions from the
Master Servicer and immediately remitting such funds (or causing such funds to be remitted) to the Master Servicer.
Contemporaneously
with the execution of this Agreement by the Purchaser and the Mortgage Loan Seller, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver a power
of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto to each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, that
permits such parties to take such other action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or recordation of any documents
and/or instruments relating to any Mortgage

�
Loan which have not
been delivered, assigned or recorded at the time required for enforcement by the Trust Fund. The Mortgage Loan Seller will be
required to effect at its expense the assignment and, if applicable, recordation of its Loan Documents until the assignment and
recordation of all such Loan Documents has been completed.
(e)�����������Except
as provided below, and except with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, all documents and records
in the Mortgage Loan Seller�s possession (or under its control) relating to the Mortgage Loans that are not required to be
a part of a Mortgage File but that are reasonably required to service the Mortgage Loans and copies of the documents in the Mortgage
File (all such other documents and records, including Environmental Reports, as to any Mortgage Loan, the �Servicing File�),
together with all escrow payments, reserve funds and other comparable funds in the possession of the Mortgage Loan Seller (or under
its control) with respect to the Mortgage Loans, shall (unless they are held by a sub-servicer that shall, as of the Closing Date,
begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer pursuant to a written agreement between such parties) be delivered by the Mortgage
Loan Seller (or its agent) to the Master Servicer (as the Purchaser�s designee) no later than the Closing Date; provided,
however, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be required to deliver, and the Servicing File shall not be deemed to include
drafts of Loan Documents, attorney-client or internal communications of the Mortgage Loan Seller or its affiliates or Mortgage
Loan Seller�s credit underwriting or due diligence analyses or related data (as distinguished from Environmental Reports,
financial statements, credit reports, title reports, structural and engineering reports, appraisals and other reports, analyses
or data provided by the Borrowers or third parties other than the Mortgage Loan Seller�s attorneys). If a sub-servicer shall,
as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to a written agreement
between such parties, the Mortgage Loan Seller or its agent shall deliver a copy of the related Servicing File to the Master Servicer.
(f)������������Each
of the Mortgage Loan Seller and the Purchaser will treat, and their respective records will reflect, the transfer of the Mortgage
Loans to the Purchaser as a sale, including for tax, accounting and any regulatory purposes. Following the transfer of the Mortgage
Loans to the Purchaser, the Mortgage Loan Seller will not take any action inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans
by the Purchaser or its assignees.
(g)�����������Furthermore,
it is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by Mortgage Loan Seller to Purchaser as
provided in this Agreement be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by Mortgage Loan Seller to Purchaser and not a
pledge of the Mortgage Loans by Mortgage Loan Seller to Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of Mortgage Loan Seller.
However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property of Mortgage Loan
Seller or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans:
(i)������������this
Agreement shall hereby create a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect
in the applicable state;
(ii)�����������the
conveyance provided for in this Agreement shall hereby grant from Mortgage Loan Seller to Purchaser, and Mortgage Loan Seller hereby
grants to


-7-
�
Purchaser,
a security interest in and to all of Mortgage Loan Seller�s right, title, and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
in and to the Covered Assets and all proceeds thereof;
(iii)����������the
possession by Purchaser or its assignee of the Mortgage Notes and such other goods, letters of credit, advices of credit, instruments,
money, documents, chattel paper or certificated securities shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party or possession
by a purchaser or a Person designated by him or her, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the Uniform Commercial
Code (including, without limitation, Sections 9-306, 9-313 and 9-314 thereof) as in force in the relevant jurisdiction; and
(iv)����������notifications
to Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts, confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed
to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents of, or
Persons holding for (as applicable), Purchaser or its assignee for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable
law.
The Mortgage Loan
Seller at the direction of the Purchaser or its assignee, shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions
as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that such security interest is a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable
law and will be maintained as such. In connection herewith, Purchaser and its assignee shall have all of the rights and remedies
of a secured party and creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in the relevant jurisdiction and may execute and
file such UCC Financing Statements as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to accomplish the foregoing.
(h)�����������It
is further acknowledged and agreed by the Mortgage Loan Seller that the Purchaser intends to convey all right, title and interest
of the Purchaser from and after the Closing Date in and to the Mortgage Loans and all rights and remedies under this Agreement
(excluding the Purchaser�s rights and remedies under Sections 6(e)-(g), 9 and 11 of this Agreement)
to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, including, without limitation, all rights and remedies as may be available
under Section 6 to the Purchaser in the event of a Material Breach or a Material Defect, and the Trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders, as assignee of the Purchaser, or such other party as may be specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
shall be entitled to enforce any obligations of the Mortgage Loan Seller hereunder in connection with a Material Breach or a Material
Defect as if the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders had been an original party to this Agreement.
Section
3.�����Examination of Mortgage Files and Due Diligence Review.
The Mortgage Loan
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with any examination of the Mortgage Files and Servicing Files that may be undertaken by or on
behalf of the Purchaser. The fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct any partial or complete examination
of the Mortgage Files and/or Servicing Files shall not affect the Purchaser�s right to pursue any remedy available in equity
or at law under Section 6 for a breach of the Mortgage

(vi)����������No

(ii)�����������The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser, and the performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement
by the Purchaser, do not violate the Purchaser�s organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other
instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its assets.
(iii)����������The

(v)�����������The
Purchaser is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with,
the terms of this Agreement will not constitute a violation of, any law, any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter,

(vi)����������No
litigation is pending or, to the best of the Purchaser�s knowledge, threatened against the Purchaser which would prohibit

-13-

consent, approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice to, any governmental authority or court is
required, under federal or state law, for the Purchaser�s execution, delivery and performance of or compliance by the Purchaser
with this Agreement, or the consummation by the Purchaser of any transaction contemplated hereby, other than (1) such consents,

the lack of such consent, approval, authorization, qualification, registration, filing or notice would not have a material adverse
effect on the performance by the Purchaser under this Agreement.
(ix)���������The
Purchaser (A) prepared one or more reports on Form ABS-15G (each, a �Form 15G�) containing the findings and
conclusions of the Accountant�s Due Diligence Report and meeting the requirements of that Form 15G, Rule 15Ga-2, any other

(b)�����������Upon
discovery by any of the parties hereto of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth above which materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Mortgage Loan Seller, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice
of such breach to the other party or parties hereto.
Section
6.�����Repurchases; Substitutions.
(a)�����������If
the Purchaser discovers that any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File has not been delivered within the time periods
provided for herein, has not been properly executed, is missing, does not appear to be regular on its face or contains information
that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (each,
a �Defect�), or discovers or receives notice of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Mortgage Loan
Seller made pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan (a �Breach�),
and if such Defect is a Material Defect or such Breach is a Material Breach, then the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of
the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the
Operating Advisor, the Asset Representations Reviewer or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) shall give prompt written
notice thereof to the Mortgage Loan Seller. If any such Defect or Breach materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage
Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser,
or causes the related Mortgage Loan to be other than a �qualified mortgage� (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3)
of the Code, without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) which causes a defective mortgage loan to
be treated as a �qualified mortgage�), then such Defect shall constitute a �Material Defect� or
such Breach shall constitute a �Material Breach,� as the case may be; provided, however, that
if any of the documents specified in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
is (subject to Sections 2(c) and 2(d) hereof) not delivered, and is certified as missing pursuant to Section 2.02
of the Pooling and


-14-
�

Servicing Agreement, it shall be deemed a Material Defect. Promptly upon receiving written notice of any Material
Defect or Material Breach with respect to a Mortgage Loan, accompanied by a written demand to take the actions contemplated by
this sentence, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall, not later than 90 days from the Mortgage Loan Seller�s receipt from the Purchaser
(or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer,
the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the Asset Representations Reviewer or the Custodian, on behalf
of the Trust Fund) of notice of, and demand to take action with respect to, such Material Defect or Material Breach, as the case
may be (or, in the case of a Material Defect or Material Breach relating to a Mortgage Loan not being a �qualified mortgage�
as described in the preceding sentence, not later than 90 days after any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement discovers
such Material Defect or Material Breach, provided that the Mortgage Loan Seller has received notice in accordance with the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) (any such 90-day period, the �Initial Resolution Period�), (i) cure
the same in all material respects, (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Purchase Price or (iii) substitute
a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan (other than with respect to a Whole Loan, for which no substitution
shall be permitted) and pay to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account any Substitution Shortfall Amount in
connection therewith (provided that in no event shall such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of the Closing
Date); provided that if (i) such Material Defect or Material Breach (other than one relating to a deemed Material Defect
under the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence) is capable of being cured but not within the Initial Resolution Period,
(ii) such Material Defect or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan�s not being a �qualified mortgage�
within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions, (iii) the Mortgage Loan Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the
cure of such Material Defect or Material Breach within the Initial Resolution Period, and (iv) the Mortgage Loan Seller has delivered
to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator (who will promptly deliver a copy of such officer�s
certificate to the 17g-5 Information Provider), the Trustee, the Operating Advisor, the Asset Representations Reviewer and, prior
to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, an officer�s certificate that describes
the reason the cure was not effected within the initial 90-day period, then the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have an additional period
equal to the applicable Resolution Extension Period to complete such cure or, failing such cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan
or substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged
Property that is, in whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted
living facility, self-storage facility, theatre or fitness center (operated by a Borrower), then the failure to deliver to the
Custodian copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect. With respect
to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Mortgage Loan Seller agrees that any Defect as such term is defined in the related controlling
Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement (other than a Defect related to the promissory note for the related Companion Loan) will
constitute a Defect under this Agreement.
No delay in either
the discovery of a Material Defect or Material Breach on the part of any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or in providing
notice of such Material Defect or Material Breach shall relieve the Mortgage Loan Seller of its obligation to repurchase the related
Mortgage Loan (if it is otherwise required to do so under this Agreement) unless (i) the Mortgage Loan Seller did not otherwise
discover or have knowledge of such Material


-15-
�
�
Defect or Material
Breach, (ii) such delay is the result of the failure by a party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to provide prompt notice
as required by the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement after such party has actual knowledge of such Material Defect
or Material Breach (knowledge shall not be deemed to exist by reason of the custodian�s exception report) and such delay
precludes the Mortgage Loan Seller from curing such Material Defect or Material Breach and (iii) provided that the Mortgage Loan
Seller is afforded a cure period of 90 days from the Mortgage Loan Seller�s receipt of notice thereof, such Material Defect
or Material Breach did not relate to a Mortgage Loan not being a �qualified mortgage� as described in this section.
If the Mortgage Loan
Seller is notified of a Defect in any Mortgage File that also affects information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, the
Mortgage Loan Seller shall promptly correct such Defect and provide a new, corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Purchaser, which
corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule shall be deemed to amend and replace the existing Mortgage Loan Schedule for all purposes. Subject
to the immediately preceding paragraph, the failure of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Asset
Representations Reviewer, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to notify the Mortgage Loan Seller of a Material Defect
or Material Breach shall not constitute a waiver of any cure or repurchase obligation, provided that the Mortgage Loan Seller
must receive written notice thereof as described in this Section 6(a) before commencement of the Initial Resolution Period.
If (x) there exists
a Breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the Mortgage Loan Seller as set forth in, or made pursuant to, representation
30 or 32 of Exhibit D to this Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by the Borrower associated with the exercise
of a defeasance option, a waiver of a �due-on-sale� provision or a �due-on-encumbrance� provision or the
release of any Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer
from requiring the related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon receipt of notice from the Master Servicer or Special
Servicer, the Mortgage Loan Seller may cure such breach by transferring to the Collection Account, within 90 days of the Mortgage
Loan Seller�s receipt of such notice, the amount of any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that are the basis
of such Breach. Upon its making such deposit, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects.
Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding
any such Breach, regardless of whether it constitutes a Material Breach, and the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be obligated to
repurchase or otherwise cure such Breach.
Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6(a), in lieu of the Mortgage Loan Seller performing its obligations with respect to
any Material Breach or Material Defect provided in the three preceding paragraphs, to the extent that the Mortgage Loan Seller
and the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Special Servicer on behalf of the
Trust Fund, and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative)
are able to agree upon a cash payment payable by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Purchaser (or its assignee) that would be deemed
sufficient to compensate the Purchaser (or its assignee) for a Material Breach or Material Defect (a �Loss of Value Payment�),
the Mortgage Loan Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay such Loss of Value Payment to the Purchaser (or its assignee);
provided that a


-16-
�

Material Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a �qualified
mortgage�, within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3) (without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)(2)
which causes a defective mortgage loan to be treated as a �qualified mortgage�), may not be cured by a Loss of Value
Payment. Upon its making such payment, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Material Breach or Material
Defect in all respects. Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and
its assignees regarding any such Material Breach or Material Defect, and the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase
or replace the related Mortgage Loan or otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material Defect.
(b)����������In
connection with any repurchase of, or substitution for, a Mortgage Loan contemplated by this Section 6:
(i)�����������the
Custodian, the Master Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan other than a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer
(with respect to any such Mortgage Loan that is a Specially Serviced Loan), pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall
each be required to tender to the Mortgage Loan Seller, and the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be entitled to receive therefrom, all
portions of the Mortgage File (in the case of the Custodian) and the Servicing File (in the case of the Master Servicer and the
Special Servicer, as applicable) and any and all other documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon delivery:
(A)�����������
to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a trust receipt, and
(B)�����������
to the Custodian by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement
by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt of the Purchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall Amount
from the Mortgage Loan Seller;
(ii)����������each
document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was endorsed or assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned
without recourse in the form of endorsement or assignment provided to the Custodian by the Mortgage Loan Seller, as the case may
be, to the Mortgage Loan Seller as shall be necessary to vest in the Mortgage Loan Seller the legal and beneficial ownership of
each Removed Mortgage Loan to the extent such ownership was transferred to the Trustee; and
(iii)���������the
Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall release, or cause the release of, any
escrow payments and reserve funds held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the
Special Servicer, as the case may be, in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan(s) to the Mortgage Loan Seller.
(c)����������This
Section 6 provides the sole remedies with respect to the Mortgage Loans available to the Purchaser, and its successors and
permitted assigns (i.e., the Trustee and the holders of the Certificates) in respect of any Defect in a Mortgage File or
any Breach. If the


-17-
�
Mortgage Loan Seller
defaults on its obligations to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section
6, or disputes its obligation to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section
6, the Purchaser may take such action as is appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including, without limitation,
the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings. To the extent the Purchaser prevails in such proceeding, the Mortgage
Loan Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of such obligation of the Mortgage Loan Seller to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in
accordance with this Section 6. To the extent the Mortgage Loan Seller prevails in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall
reimburse the Mortgage Loan Seller for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceeding.
Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if there is a Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage
Loan, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may
be released pursuant to the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Loan Documents (and such Mortgaged Property
is, in fact, released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Loan Documents
and the Mortgage Loan Seller provides an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event
to occur and (iii) each Rating Agency then rating the Certificates shall have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect
to such release.
(d)�����������As
to any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) or the Special
Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties), the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver to the Custodian
for such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master Servicer), the related Mortgage File with the related Mortgage
Note endorsed as required by clause (i) of Section 2.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of substitution
shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received by the Master Servicer, shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to the related
Mortgage Loan Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date. For the month of repurchase or substitution, distributions to Certificateholders
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will include the Monthly Payment(s) due on the related Removed Mortgage Loan and
received by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of repurchase or
substitution, as applicable, and the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts received thereafter in respect
of such Removed Mortgage Loan.
In any month in which
the Mortgage Loan Seller substitutes one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Removed Mortgage Loans, pursuant
to this Agreement, the Master Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount. At the direction of the Certificate
Administrator, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deposit, or deliver to the Master Servicer for deposit, into the Collection Account
cash equal to such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Mortgage Files for such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans, without
any reimbursement thereof. Any Mortgage Loan that is repurchased or replaced by the Mortgage Loan Seller pursuant to this Section
6 shall constitute a �Removed Mortgage Loan�.�


-18-
�
(e)�����������If
the Mortgage Loan Seller (i) receives from any Person (other than the Depositor) any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase
Request; (ii) rejects any Repurchase Request or is in dispute with the Person making any Repurchase Request as to the merits of
such Repurchase Request (a �Dispute�); or (iii) receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request
Withdrawal, then the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver notice thereof (each, a �Rule 15Ga-1 Notice�) to the
Depositor within ten (10) Business Days of the Mortgage Loan Seller�s receipt thereof (or in the case of a rejection or
Dispute, the occurrence or commencement, as applicable, thereof). Each Rule 15Ga-1 Notice shall include (i) the identity of the
related Mortgage Loan, (ii) the date the Repurchase Communication of the Repurchase Request or the Repurchase Request Withdrawal
was received, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of a Repurchase Request, the identity of the Person making such Repurchase
Request and, if known, the basis for the Repurchase Request (as asserted in the Repurchase Request).
�Repurchase
Communication� means, for purposes of this Section 6(e) only, any communication, whether oral or written, which
need not be in any specific form.
(f)������������The
Mortgage Loan Seller shall provide to the Depositor relevant portions of any Form ABS-15G that the Mortgage Loan Seller is required
pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (only to the extent that such
portions relate to any Mortgage Loan) on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days before the date such Form ABS-15G is
required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection with such filing, upon the request of the Mortgage
Loan Seller, the Depositor shall provide to the Mortgage Loan Seller the Trust Fund�s Central Index Key (CIK) number and
such other information regarding the principal balances of the Mortgage Loans as is reasonably necessary for the Mortgage Loan
Seller to complete and file such Form ABS-15G.
(g)�����������The
Mortgage Loan Seller agrees that a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will not, in connection with providing the Mortgage Loan Seller
with any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice (for purposes of this Section 6(g) only, as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement),
be required to provide any information protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrines. In addition,
the Mortgage Loan Seller hereby acknowledges that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement is so provided only to assist the Mortgage Loan Seller, the Depositor and its Affiliates to comply with
Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and any other requirement of law or regulation and (ii)
(A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider and (B) no information provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d)
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the
exercise of any legal right the Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider may have with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to
any Repurchase Request that is the subject of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice.
(h)�����������Each
party hereto agrees that the receipt of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice or the delivery of any notice required to be delivered pursuant to
this Section 6 shall not, in and of itself, constitute delivery of notice of, receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the
Mortgage Loan Seller of, any Material Defect or Material Breach.


-19-
�

(i)������������If
any Breach pertains to a representation or warranty that the related Loan Documents or any particular Loan Document requires the
related Borrower to bear the costs and expenses associated with any particular action or matter under such Loan Document(s), then
the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be required to repurchase or replace such Mortgage Loan and the sole remedy with respect to
any Breach of such representation shall be to cure such Breach within the applicable cure period (as the same may be extended)
by reimbursing the Trust Fund (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the reasonable amount of any such costs and expenses
incurred by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust Fund that are the
basis of such Breach and have not been reimbursed by the related Borrower; provided, however, that in the event any
such costs and expenses exceed $10,000, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have the option to either repurchase or substitute for the
related Mortgage Loan as provided above or pay such costs and expenses. Except as provided in the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall remit the amount of such costs and expenses and upon its making such remittance, the Mortgage
Loan Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects. To the extent any fees or expenses that are the subject
of a cure by the Mortgage Loan Seller are subsequently obtained from the related Borrower, the portion of the cure payment made
by the Mortgage Loan Seller equal to such fees or expenses obtained from the Borrower shall promptly be returned to the Mortgage
Loan Seller pursuant to Section 2.03(e), of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Section
7.�����Closing.

purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans (the �Closing�) shall be held at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham

MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE MORTGAGE LOAN SELLER
REGARDING THE INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE LOANS
�

(1)Whole Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans. Except
with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest
in a Mortgage Loan. Each Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan is a portion of a whole loan evidenced by a Mortgage Note.
At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Purchaser, no Mortgage Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other
than assignments to the Mortgage Loan Seller), participation or pledge, and the Mortgage Loan Seller had good title to, and was
the sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any
other ownership interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement. Mortgage
Loan Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment to Purchaser constitutes
a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security
interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan.
 
���


(2)Loan Document Status. Each related Mortgage Note,
Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf
of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing
agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors� rights generally and (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that
certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest,
late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable
by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability
will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the mortgagee�s realization of the principal
benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the �Standard Qualifications�).
 
���


Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentences,
there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Borrower with respect to any of
the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such valid offset, defense,
counterclaim or right based on



D-1
�

intentional fraud by Mortgage Loan Seller in connection with the
origination of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Mortgage
Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.
 
���


(3)Mortgage Provisions. The Loan Documents for each
Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization
against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization
by judicial or, if applicable, non-judicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.
 
���


(4)Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications. Since
origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File or as otherwise provided in the related Loan
Documents (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related Loan Documents have not
been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect; (b) no related Mortgaged
Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes
with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged
Property; and (c) neither the related Borrower nor the related guarantor has been released from its material obligations under
the Mortgage Loan. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, except as contained in a written document included in the Mortgage File,
there have been no modifications, amendments or waivers, that could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
such Mortgage Loan consented to by Mortgage Loan Seller on or after January 4, 2016.
 
���


(5)Lien; Valid Assignment. Subject to the Standard
Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits to the Trust constitutes
a legal, valid and binding assignment to the Trust. Each related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits is freely
assignable without the consent of the related Borrower. Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on
the related Borrower�s fee or leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan
or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below) and the exceptions to paragraph (6) set forth
on in Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D (each such exception, a �Title Exception�)), except as the
enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting Permitted
Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-off Date, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s
knowledge, is free and clear of any recorded mechanics� liens, recorded materialmen�s liens and other recorded encumbrances
which are prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured
against by a lender�s title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge and
subject to the rights of tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions),
no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien
of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender�s title insurance
policy (as described below). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of
any security



D-2
�

interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that
possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code (�UCC�) financing
statements is required in order to effect such perfection.
 
���


(6)Permitted Liens; Title Insurance. Each Mortgaged
Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable
form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by
a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a �marked up� commitment, in each case
binding on the title insurer) (the �Title Policy�) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or
with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect
to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves),
that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage,
which lien is subject only to (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet
due and payable; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c)
the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties
are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related
Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; and (f) if the related Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted
with another Mortgage Loan (each a �Crossed Mortgage Loan�), the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage
Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with such Crossed Mortgage Loan, provided that none of which items (a) through
(f), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property
or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Borrower�s ability to pay its obligations when they become
due (collectively, the �Permitted Encumbrances�). Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding
sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of
the related Mortgage. Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force
and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Mortgage Loan Seller thereunder and no claims
have been paid thereunder. Neither the Mortgage Loan Seller, nor to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, any other holder
of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.
 
���


(7)Junior Liens. It being understood that B notes
secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Crossed Mortgage
Loan, there are, as of origination, and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date, no subordinate
mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances
and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmen�s liens (which are the subject of the representation
in paragraph (5) above), and equipment and other personal property financing). Except as set forth in Schedule D-



D-3
�

2 to this Exhibit D, the Mortgage Loan Seller has no knowledge
of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related Borrower.
 
���


(8)Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits. There
exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (either as a separate instrument or incorporated
into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases,
Rents and Profits creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest
in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related Borrower to exercise
certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the
related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. The related Mortgage
or related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under the
Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related mortgagee to enter into
possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the mortgagee.
 
���


(9)UCC Filings. If the related Mortgaged Property
is operated as a hospitality property, the Mortgage Loan Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded
(or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in
the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect
a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned
by such Borrower and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property
subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the
related Loan Documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may
be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each
related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty
described above. No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to
the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required
in order to effect such perfection.
 
���


(10)Condition of Property. Mortgage Loan Seller or
the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within six months of origination
of the Mortgage Loan and within twelve months of the Cut-off Date.
 
���


An engineering report or property condition assessment was
prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than twelve months prior to the Cut-off Date. To the
Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination
of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage
(other than (i) any damage or deficiency that is estimated to cost less



D-4
�

than $50,000 to repair, (ii) any deferred maintenance for
which escrows were established at origination and (iii) any damage fully covered by insurance) that would affect materially and
adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.
 
���


(11)Taxes and Assessments. All taxes, governmental
assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments
thereof, that could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the
Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have been paid,
or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and
penalties, if any, thereon. For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and
other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the earlier of (a) the
date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement action is entitled
to be taken by the related taxing authority.
 
���


(12)Condemnation. As of the date of origination and
to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Mortgage Loan
Seller�s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the
total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation
of the Mortgaged Property.
 
���


(13)Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan. As of the date
of origination and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was no pending or filed action,
suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any Borrower, guarantor, or Borrower�s interest
in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such
Borrower�s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Borrower�s
ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor�s ability to perform under the related guaranty,
(e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Loan Documents or (f) the current principal use of the
Mortgaged Property.
 
���


(14)Escrow Deposits. All escrow deposits and payments
required to be escrowed with lender pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Mortgage
Loan Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith,
and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with lender under the related Loan Documents
are being conveyed by the Mortgage Loan Seller to Purchaser or its servicer.
 
���


(15)No Holdbacks. The Stated Principal Balance as
of the Cut-off Date of the Mortgage Loan set forth on the mortgage loan schedule attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement
has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future



D-5
�

advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount
of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction
of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Borrower
or other considerations determined by Mortgage Loan Seller to merit such holdback).
 
���


(16)Insurance. Each related Mortgaged Property is,
and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in
accordance with coverage found under a �special cause of loss form� or �all risk form� that includes replacement
cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial
strength rating of any one of the following: (i) at least �A-:VIII� from A.M. Best Company, (ii) at least �A3�
(or the equivalent) from Moody�s Investors Service, Inc. or (iii) at least �A-� from Standard & Poor�s
Ratings Services (collectively the �Insurance Rating Requirements�), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible)
not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement
cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Borrower and included in the Mortgaged
Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such
endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.
 
���


Each related Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required
to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary
deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal
balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
 
���


If any material part of the improvements, exclusive of a
parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as having special flood hazards, the related Borrower is required to maintain insurance in the maximum amount available
under the National Flood Insurance Program.
 
���


If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the related Borrower
is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or �named storms� issued by an
insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils
and/or named storms.
 
���


The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required to be covered
pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance
Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury (including bodily injury and
death) in amounts as are generally required by the Mortgage Loan Seller for loans originated for securitization, and in any event
not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.

An architectural or engineering consultant has performed
an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic
condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing either the scenario expected limit (�SEL�) or
the probable maximum loss (�PML�) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance,
the SEL or PML, as applicable, was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of
exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL or PML, as applicable, would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement
costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an insurer rated at least �A:VIII�
by A.M. Best Company or �A3� (or the equivalent) from Moody�s Investors Service, Inc. or �A-� by
Standard & Poor�s Ratings Services in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL or PML, as applicable.
 
���


The Loan Documents require insurance proceeds in respect
of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property, with
respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of the related Mortgage Loan (or Whole
Loan, if applicable), the lender (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair
or restoration progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, if
applicable) together with any accrued interest thereon.
 
���


All premiums on all insurance policies referred to in this
section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the lender under the Mortgage
Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability
insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the Trustee (or, in the
case of a Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the applicable Other Trustee). Each related Mortgage Loan obligates
the related Borrower to maintain all such insurance and, at such Borrower�s failure to do so, authorizes the lender to maintain
such insurance at the Borrower�s cost and expense and to charge such Borrower for related premiums. All such insurance policies
(other than commercial liability policies) require at least 10 days� prior notice to the lender of termination or cancellation
arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30 days prior notice to the lender of termination or cancellation (or
such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment
of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.
 
���


(17)Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots. Each Mortgaged
Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access via an irrevocable
easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited
access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate
for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property
which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged
Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable



D-7
�

governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which
case the Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which
the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created.
 
���


(18)No Encroachments. To Mortgage Loan Seller�s
knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the lender�s Title Policy (or, if such policy
is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a �marked up�
commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for
the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage
Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect
the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.
No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially
and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained
under the Title Policy. No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the removal of which would not materially
and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements obtained with
respect to the Title Policy.
 
���


(19)No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation.
No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature (except
that an ARD Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess of the rate in effect prior to the Anticipated
Repayment Date) or an equity participation by Mortgage Loan Seller.
 
���


(20)REMIC. The Mortgage Loan is a �qualified
mortgage� within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3) (but determined without regard to the rule in the U.S. Department
of Treasury Regulations (the �Treasury Regulations�) Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage
loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Borrower at origination
did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either: (a) such Mortgage Loan is secured by an
interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having a fair
market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage
Loan (or Whole Loan, as applicable) on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price
of the Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, if applicable) on such date, provided that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of
the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to
the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b) substantially all
of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property which served as the only security
for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party credit enhancement within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)
of the Treasury Regulations). If the Mortgage Loan was �significantly modified� prior to the Closing Date so as to
result in a taxable exchange under Section



D-8
�

1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a result of
the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause (B)(a)(i)
above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause
(B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto. Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage
Loan constitute �customary prepayment penalties� within the meaning of Section 1.860G-1(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.
 
���


(21)Compliance with Usury Laws. The Mortgage Rate
(exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied
as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining
to usury.
 
���


(22)Authorized to do Business. To the extent required
under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held the Mortgage Note, each holder of the Mortgage
Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or the
failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan by the Trust.
 
���


(23)Trustee under Deed of Trust. With respect to each
Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, as of the
Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of
trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the
Mortgage and applicable law by the related mortgagee.
 
���


(24)Local Law Compliance. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s
knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect�s letter, a zoning
consultant�s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance
consistent with the investigation conducted by the Mortgage Loan Seller for similar commercial, multifamily or, if applicable,
manufactured housing community mortgage loans intended for securitization, with respect to the improvements located on or forming
part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan and as of the Cut-off
Date, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively �Zoning
Regulations�) other than those which (i) constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure, as to which as the Mortgaged
Property may be restored or repaired to the full extent necessary to maintain the use of the structure immediately prior to a
casualty or the inability to restore or repair to the full extent necessary to maintain the use or structure immediately prior
to the casualty would not materially and adversely affect the use or operation of the Mortgaged Property, (ii) are insured by
the Title Policy or other insurance policy, (iii) are insured by law and ordinance insurance coverage in amounts customarily required
by the Mortgage Loan Seller for loans originated for securitization that provides coverage for additional costs to rebuild and/or
repair the property to current Zoning Regulations or (iv) would not have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan. The terms
of the Loan Documents require the



D-9
�

Borrower to comply in all material respects with all applicable
governmental regulations, zoning and building laws.
 
���


(25)Licenses and Permits. Each Borrower covenants
in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for
its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge based upon
a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation
conducted by the Mortgage Loan Seller for similar commercial, multifamily or, if applicable, manufactured housing community mortgage
loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect.
The Mortgage Loan requires the related Borrower to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged
Property is located.
 
���


(26)Recourse Obligations. The Loan Documents for each
Mortgage Loan provide that (a) the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity shall be fully liable for actual losses,
liabilities, costs and damages arising from certain acts of the related Borrower and/or its principals specified in the related
Loan Documents, which acts generally include the following: (i) acts of fraud or intentional material misrepresentation, (ii)
misapplication or misappropriation of rents, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, (iii) intentional material physical waste
of the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) any breach of the environmental covenants contained in the related Loan Documents, and (b)
the Mortgage Loan shall become full recourse to the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity, if the related Borrower
files a voluntary petition under federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law.
 
���


(27)Mortgage Releases. The terms of the related Mortgage
or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage
except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment, or partial Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), of not
less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion
of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage
Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), (d) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions
of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and
which were not afforded any value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for
physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation.
With respect to any partial release under the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x) such release of collateral
(i) would not constitute a �significant modification� of the subject Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(b)(2)
of the Treasury Regulations and (ii) would not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be a �qualified mortgage�
within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3)(A); or (y) the mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Loan Documents,
condition such release of collateral on the related Borrower�s delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified
in the immediately preceding clause (x). For purposes of the preceding clause (x), if the fair market value of the
real



D-10
�

property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release
is not equal to at least 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, as applicable) outstanding after the
release, the Borrower is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.
 
���


In the case of any Mortgage Loan, in the event of a taking of any portion of a Mortgaged
  Property by a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof, whether by legal proceeding or by agreement, the
  Borrower can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in an amount not less than the amount
  required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, condemnation proceeds may not be required to be applied to
  the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Borrower, if, immediately after the release of such portion of
  the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value
  of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal
  balance of the Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, as applicable).
 
���


No Mortgage Loan that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is a Crossed
  Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof,
  including due to a partial condemnation, other than in compliance with the loan-to-value ratio and other requirements of the
  REMIC Provisions.
 
���


(28)Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls. Each Mortgage
requires the Borrower to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties)
and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties that have leases
contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements, which annual financial statements with respect
to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Borrower are in the form of an annual combined balance sheet of the Borrower entities
(and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members� capital and cash flows, including
a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined basis.
 
���


(29)Acts of Terrorism Exclusion. With respect to each
Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by
an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as �TRIA�), from coverage, or if such
coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related
special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements)
did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, do not, as of the
Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is
covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly
waive or prohibit



D-11
�


the mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism,
as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be limited by
commercial availability on commercially reasonable terms, or as otherwise indicated on Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D; provided,
however, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially
available, the Borrower under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Borrower shall
not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable
in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents (without
giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance)
at such time, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the Borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount
of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount.
 
���


(30)Due on Sale or Encumbrance. Subject to specific
exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a �due on sale� or other such provision for the acceleration
of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which
consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Loan Documents
(which provide for transfers without the consent of the lender which are customarily acceptable to the Mortgage Loan Seller lending
on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out
or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers
by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater
than 50% in the related Borrower, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family
and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in
the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the related Borrower, (iv)
transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Borrower, a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents
or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v) transfers
of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies, (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters
of paragraphs (27) and (32) herein or the exceptions thereto set forth in Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D, or (vii) by reason of
any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan as set forth on Schedule D-2 to this Exhibit D,
or future permitted mezzanine debt in each case as set forth on Schedule D-3 to this Exhibit D or (b) the related Mortgaged Property
is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion
Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money
security interests, (iii) any Crossed Mortgage Loan as set forth on Schedule D-4 to this Exhibit D or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.
The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review
of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Borrower is responsible for



D-12
�

such payment along with all other reasonable fees and expenses
incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
 
���


(31)Single-Purpose Entity. Each Mortgage Loan requires
the Borrower to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding. Both the Loan Documents and
the organizational documents of the Borrower with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance in
excess of $5 million provide that the Borrower is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal
Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel�s opinion regarding non-consolidation of the Borrower. For this purpose, a
�Single-Purpose Entity� shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or
if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or
the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning
and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business
unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented
in the related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest
in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s)
or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other
person (other than a Borrower for a Crossed Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart
from any other person or entity.
 
���


(32)Defeasance. With respect to any Mortgage Loan
that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, can be defeased (a �Defeasance�), (i) the Loan Documents provide for
Defeasance as a unilateral right of the Borrower, subject to satisfaction of conditions specified in the Loan Documents; (ii)
the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the Closing Date; (iii) the Borrower is permitted to pledge only United
States �government securities� within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations, the revenues
from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance, be sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Loan when due,
including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after the first date on which payment may be made
without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty) or, if the Mortgage Loan is an ARD Loan, the entire principal
balance outstanding on the Anticipated Repayment Date, and if the Mortgage Loan permits partial releases of real property in connection
with partial Defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to pay all such scheduled payments calculated on
a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (a) 110% of the allocated loan amount for the
real property to be released and (b) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; (iv) the Borrower is required to
provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled
payments under the Mortgage Note as set forth in clause (iii) above; (v) if the Borrower would continue to own assets in
addition to the Defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan secured by defeasance collateral is required to be assumed
(or the mortgagee may require such assumption) by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vi) the



D-13
�

Borrower is required to provide an opinion of counsel that the
mortgagee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any other claim or interest; and (vii) the Borrower is
required to pay all rating agency fees associated with Defeasance (if rating confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto)
and all other reasonable expenses associated with Defeasance, including, but not limited to, accountant�s fees and opinions
of counsel.
 
���


(33)Fixed Interest Rates. Each Mortgage Loan bears
interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage Loan, except in the case of ARD Loans and
situations where default interest is imposed.
 
���


(34)Ground Leases. For purposes of this Agreement,
a �Ground Lease� shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the
ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land, or with respect to air rights leases, the
air, and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who
may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground
lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax
abatement or other benefit.
 
���


With respect to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan
is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber the
related lessor�s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other
agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Mortgage Loan Seller, its successors and assigns, Mortgage Loan Seller represents
and warrants that:
 
���


(a)The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground
Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.
The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered
by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns
in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage;
 
���


(b)The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing
included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or modified, or canceled
or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the lender, and no such consent has been
granted by the Mortgage Loan Seller since the origination of the Mortgage Loan except as reflected in any written instruments
which are included in the related Mortgage File;
 
���


(c)The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original
term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either
Borrower or the mortgagee) that extends not less



D-14
�

than 20 years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage
Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a
Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);
 
���


(d)The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens
or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor
and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii) is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the mortgagee
on the lessor�s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;
 
���


(e)The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable
restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors
and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder, and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the
holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor;
 
���


(f)The Mortgage Loan Seller has not received any written
notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge,
there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would
result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, such Ground
Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date;
 
���


(g)The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor
and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the lender written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default
or termination is effective against the lender unless such notice is given to the lender;
 
���


(h)A lender is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including,
where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings)
to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the lender�s receipt of notice of any default before the
lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;
 
���


(i)The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on
subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Mortgage Loan Seller in connection with loans originated for
securitization;
 
���


(j)Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other
agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the portion
of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee�s interest (other than (i) de minimis amounts for minor casualties
or (ii) in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in clause (k) below) will be applied either
to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the


��


D-15
�
�

related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold
  amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the lender or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse
  such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage
  Loan, together with any accrued interest;
 
���


(k)In the case of a total or substantially total taking
or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related
insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee�s interest in respect of a total or
substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied
first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and

�

(l)Provided that the lender cures any defaults which are
susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with lender upon termination of the Ground
Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.

�

(35)Servicing. The servicing and collection practices
used by the Mortgage Loan Seller with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and have met customary industry
standards for servicing of commercial loans for conduit loan programs.
 
���


(36)Origination and Underwriting. The origination
practices of the Mortgage Loan Seller (or the related originator if the Mortgage Loan Seller was not the originator) with respect
to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan and
the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local
law relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address or otherwise
cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this Exhibit D.
 
���


(37)No Material Default; Payment Record. No Mortgage
Loan has been more than 30 days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace or cure period, in making required payments since
origination, and as of the date hereof, no Mortgage Loan is more than 30 days delinquent (beyond any applicable grace or cure
period) in making required payments as of the Closing Date. To the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, there is (a) no material
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan, or (b) no event (other than payments
due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would
constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration,
in the case of either clause (a) or clause (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan
or the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged Property, provided, however, that this representation and warranty does
not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception
scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Mortgage Loan Seller in this Exhibit D. No person other
than



D-16
�

the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of
default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the Loan Documents.
 
���


(38)Bankruptcy. As of the date of origination of the
related Mortgage Loan and to the Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, no Borrower, guarantor or tenant
occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.

(39)Organization of Borrower. With respect to each
Mortgage Loan, in reliance on certified copies of the organizational documents of the Borrower delivered by the Borrower in connection
with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, the Borrower is an entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States
of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Except with respect to any Crossed Mortgage Loan, no
Mortgage Loan has a Borrower that is an Affiliate of another Borrower under another Mortgage Loan. (An �Affiliate�
for purposes of this paragraph (39) means, a Borrower that is under direct or indirect common ownership and control with another
Borrower.)
 
���


(40)Environmental Conditions. A Phase I environmental
site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I and or Phase II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans,
a Phase II environmental site assessment (collectively, an �ESA�) meeting ASTM requirements conducted by a
reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12 months prior to its origination date (or an
update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA either (i) did not identify the existence of recognized environmental conditions
(as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter �Environmental Condition�) at the related
Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation with respect to any Environmental Condition that was identified, or (ii)
if the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least
one of the following statements is true: (A) an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant to be sufficient
to cover the estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or the Environmental Condition
has been escrowed by the related Borrower and is held or controlled by the related lender; (B) if the only Environmental Condition
relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water, and
the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required
to be instituted by the related Borrower that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C) the Environmental
Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the date hereof,
and, if and as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority
(or the Environmental Condition affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as
�closed� or a reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D) a secured
creditor environmental policy or a pollution legal liability insurance policy that covers liability for the Environmental Condition
was obtained from an insurer rated no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody�s, S&P and/or Fitch; (E) a party not
related to the Borrower was identified as the responsible party for such Environmental Condition



D-17
�

and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably
estimated to be adequate to address the situation; or (F) a party related to the Borrower having financial resources reasonably
estimated to be adequate to address the situation is required to take action. To Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, except
as set forth in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the
related Mortgaged Property.
 
���


(41)Appraisal. The Servicing File contains an appraisal
of the related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within 6 months of the Mortgage Loan origination date, and within 12
months of the Closing Date. The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is either a Member of the Appraisal Institute (�MAI�)
and/or has been licensed and certified to prepare appraisals in the state where the Mortgaged Property is located. Each appraiser
has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the �Uniform
Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice� as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation and
has certified that such appraiser had no interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Borrower or in any loan
made on the security thereof, and its compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan.
 
���


(42)Mortgage Loan Schedule. The information pertaining
to each Mortgage Loan which is set forth in the mortgage loan schedule attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement is true
and correct in all material respects as of the Cut-off Date and contains all information required by this Agreement to be contained
therein.
 
���


(43)Cross-Collateralization. No Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized
or cross-defaulted with any mortgage loan that is outside the Trust, except as set forth in Schedule D-4 to this Exhibit D.
 
���


(44)Advance of Funds by the Mortgage Loan Seller.
After origination, no advance of funds has been made by Mortgage Loan Seller to the related Borrower other than in accordance
with the Loan Documents, and, to Mortgage Loan Seller�s knowledge, no funds have been received from any person other than
the related Borrower or an affiliate for, or on account of, payments due on the Mortgage Loan (other than as contemplated by the
Loan Documents, such as, by way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, amounts paid by the tenant(s) into a lender-controlled
lockbox if required or contemplated under the related lease or Loan Documents). Neither Mortgage Loan Seller nor any affiliate
thereof has any obligation to make any capital contribution to any Borrower under a Mortgage Loan, other than contributions made
on or prior to the date hereof.
 
���


(45)Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Mortgage
Loan Seller has complied in all material respects with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including without
limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan, the failure to comply with which
would have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.

  Realty Capital Hospitality Trust, Inc. and the indirect owner of 100% of the external manager of American Realty Capital Hospitality
  Trust, Inc. The key principals and controlling parties of AR Capital are Nicholas S. Schorsch and William M. Kahane. Mr. Schorsch
  and certain family members are the indirect majority owners of AR Capital. Mr. Schorsch previously served as the chairman of the
  board of directors of the guarantor. Mr. Kahane is currently the executive chairman of the board of directors of the guarantor.

 The Mortgaged Properties included in the Equity Inns Portfolio
  are subject to operating management agreements with wholly-owned subsidiaries of AR Capital (the �Operators�)
  pursuant to which the Operators are responsible for the management of the Mortgaged Properties. The Operators subcontract such
  management responsibilities under management agreements with four managers, one of which is Crestline Hotels & Resorts, LLC,
  which is 60% owned by AR Capital or an affiliate of AR Capital, and manages twelve of the 21 Mortgaged Properties. As of the origination
  of the related Mortgage Loan, AR Capital also owned a less than 3.0% interest in each Borrower.
�
AR Capital or companies owned and controlled by AR
Capital also previously externally managed American Realty Capital Properties Inc. (�ARCP�) until January 2014,
when the company became self-managed. On October 29, 2014, ARCP, a real estate investment trust sponsored by AR Capital, and of
which Mr. Schorsch was then the chairman, issued a press release announcing that, based on preliminary findings of ARCP�s
audit committee, such committee concluded that previously issued financial statements and other financial information contained
in ARCP�s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, and ARCP�s earnings releases and other financial communications
for those periods should no longer be relied upon. The audit committee stated that it believed that ARCP incorrectly included�

certain amounts related to its non-controlling interests
in the calculation of adjusted funds from operations (�AFFO�), a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, and, as a
result, overstated AFFO for certain periods. According to the press release, the audit committee believed that this error was
identified but intentionally not corrected by the responsible individuals at ARCP, and other AFFO and financial statement errors
were intentionally made, resulting in an overstatement of AFFO and an understatement of ARCP�s net loss for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2014. As a result of these accounting irregularities, the chief financial officer and chief accounting
officer resigned from ARCP. In addition, Mr. Schorsch resigned as chairman of ARCP in October 2014, and also resigned from the
boards of certain other companies sponsored by AR Capital, including the guarantor.
�
On March 2, 2015, ARCP (which has changed its name
to VEREIT, Inc.) filed amended financial statements. For year-end 2013, the net loss was increased and AFFO decreased by $0.20
per share. As part of the restatement, the audit committee identified certain payments made to ARC Properties Advisors, LLC and
certain affiliates that were not appropriately documented totaling $8.5 million. Additionally, the investigation found that equity
awards made to Mr. Schorsch and another former executive in connection with the transition to self-management of the company contained
provisions that, as drafted, were more favorable than those approved by the Compensation Committee of the company�s Board of Directors,
and also

ARCP has also disclosed that it is the subject of various regulatory
  investigations, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney�s office for the Southern District
  of New York. It has further been reported that ARCP is the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
�
Between October 30, 2014
and January 20, 2015, ARCP, AR Capital, Mr. Schorsch, Mr. Kahane and certain other former officers and current and former directors
of ARCP were named as defendants in ten securities class action complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, which were subsequently consolidated under the caption In re American Realty Capital Properties, Inc.
Litigation, No. 15-MC-00040 (AKH), which alleged various violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 in connection with the purchase or sale of ARCP�s securities. The complaint also included allegations of payment
of inappropriate fees by ARCP to companies controlled by Mr. Schorsch. ARCP, AR Capital, their affiliates, as well as Mr. Schorsch
and Mr. Kahane, have also been named in various other lawsuits related to regulatory findings and otherwise, including class actions,
derivative actions and securities

DBRS Confirms Ratings of COMM 2016-CCRE28 Mortgage Trust, Stable Trends


January 24, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings for all classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-CCRE28 (the Certificates) issued by COMM 2016-CCRE28 Mortgage Trust (the Trust) as follows: 

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-HR at AAA (sf)
-- Class XP-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-HR at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-M at AAA (sf)

-- Class X-E at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-F at AAA (sf)
-- Class B at AA (sf)
-- Class C at A (sf)
-- Class D at BBB (high) (sf)
-- Class E at BBB (low) (sf)
-- Class F at BB (high) (sf)
-- Class G at BB (low) (sf)
-- Class H at B (low) (sf)

All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first loss piece, Class J. 

The rating confirmations reflect that the transaction�s current performance remains stable. The collateral consists of 49 fixed-rate loans secured by 119 commercial properties. As of the January 2017 remittance, all 49 loans remain in the pool, with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $1.02 billion, representing a collateral reduction of 0.3% since issuance as a result of scheduled loan amortization. The pool has a high concentration of loans secured by properties that are either fully or primarily leased to single tenants, as 13 loans (32.2% of the pool) are secured by properties leased in this manner; however, of the six loans (26.7% of the pool) in the Top 15, four loans (14.2% of the pool) are leased to investment-grade tenants (Netflix, Inc., FedEx, the City and County of San Francisco, and Apple Inc.). Pool-wide, 11 loans (40.6% of the pool) are structured with full interest-only (IO) terms, while an additional 23 loans (43.9% of the pool) have partial IO periods remaining, ranging from three months to 48 months. To date, 43 loans (80.2% of the pool) have reported partial-year 2016 net cash flow (NCF) figures. Based on these financials, the transaction had a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA debt yield of 1.57 times (x) and 8.9%, respectively, compared with the DBRS underwritten (UW) figures of 1.51x and 8.4%, respectively. 

As of the January 2017 remittance, there are no loans in special servicing and one loan (1.0% of the pool) on the servicer�s watchlist. The Holiday Inn Corpus Christi Airport (Prospectus ID#32) is secured by a 237-key, limited-service hotel located in Corpus Christi, Texas. The loan was placed on the servicer�s watchlist in September 2016, as a result of deferred maintenance. The servicer has sent a letter of deferred maintenance to the property contact and requested an updated plan of remediation. 

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted and specially serviced loans, as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool, in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please log into DBRS CMBS IReports at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

Notes:
All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

This rating is endorsed by DBRS Ratings Limited for use in the European Union.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
