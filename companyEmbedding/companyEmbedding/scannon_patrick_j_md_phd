Development of innovative therapies for diseases with large unmet diseases. As a founder of XOMA (www.xoma.com), I have dedicated my scientific and clinical career to the goal of bringing such products into the market so that patients may benefit across a broad range of diseases. XOMA has an active product development porfolio and, via incorporation of many innovative technologies, has played an important industry-wide role in developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for human use.2. Development and application of biodefense policy incorporating technological responsiveness against intentional, natural and accidental threats to the American people. To that end, I have worked with DoD through DARPA (membership on DSRC) and DTRA  (membership on TRAC), HHS (membership on NBSB), DHS (through BNA) as well as key members within two White House administrations to develop improved and accelerated responsiveness. I continue to have interest in this area. 3. Searching for MIAs and POWs lost during WWII. As founder of the BentProp Project (www.bentprop.org), I have had the privilege of leading a team of selected self-funded volunteers, each with essential expertise (eg, history, aviation, diving, navigation), who are dedicated to finding and assisting with identifying Americans missing in action from WWII.ErfahrungRetired from XOMABentProp ProjectJanuar 1993  –  Heute (24 Jahre 7 Monate)dummy1dummy2Original anzeigenÜbersetzung anzeigenKenntnisseBiotechnologieBiotechnologyBiopharmazeutikaBiopharmaceuticalsAntikörperAntibodiesMonoklonale AntikörperMonoclonal AntibodiesLifesciencesArzneimittelentwicklungDrug DevelopmentGeschäftsführungLeadershipProteinchemieProtein ChemistryKlinische ForschungClinical ResearchPharmaforschungDrug DiscoveryImmunologieImmunologyZellkulturenCell CultureAssay-EntwicklungAssay DevelopmentMolekularbiologieMolecular BiologyRegierungsgeschäfteGovernment Affairs20+ anzeigenIn VitroHochdurchsatz-ScreeningHigh Throughput ScreeningRegierung und BehördenGovernmentIn VivoGute LaborpraxisGLPZellenCellELISALC-MSPharmakokinetikPharmacokineticsChromatografieChromatographyProteinreinigungProtein PurificationTechnologietransferTechnology TransferBioanalyseBioanalysisDMPKPharmakologiePharmacologyMassenspektrometrieMass SpectrometryKrebsCancerHPLCBiowissenschaftenLife SciencesProtein ExpressionWeniger anzeigenWie finden Sie diese Übersetzung?Gut•FehlerhaftDanke für Ihre Hilfe!AusbildungSee belowMD (Internal Medicine) and PhD (Chemistry), Medicine, ChemistryMD (Internal Medicine) and PhD (Chemistry), Medicine, ChemistryEDUCATIONUniversity of Georgia, B.
