                    Abbie J. Smith's research on corporate governance and transparency was stimulated by service on corporate and mutual fund boards and the heightened interest in these issues resulting from the wave of accounting scandals that began with Enron. Her recent corporate governance research examines the “CEO factor” in explaining corporate behavior as manifested in the relation between CEO lifestyle and corporate reporting, insider trading, risk management, bankruptcy, and social responsibility.
Smith is a member of the board of directors of HNI Corporation, Ryder System, Inc., Dimensional Funds, and Chicago-based UBS Funds, and has served on audit, compensation, finance, and governance committees. She feels her board experience has given her an inside perspective on the generation and evaluation of business models and strategies, the determinants of corporate investment, financing, reporting behavior, and the interplay between academic research and its business applications.  This perspective heavily influences her approach to research and teaching. 

She earned a bachelor's degree in 1975 from the College of Human Ecology at Cornell University, an MBA in 1979, and a PhD in accounting in 1981 from Cornell University. She joined the Chicago Booth faculty in 1980. She received a Marvin Bower Fellowship from the Harvard Business School, a McKinsey Award for Excellence in Teaching, and grants from the Accounting Research Center, Fama Miller Center, and IGM at Booth. 

Smith enjoys yoga, running, theater, music, gardening, and travel.

                                New: CEO Materialism and Corporate Social Responsibility
                            Date Posted:
                             Jun  14,
                             2016
                            We study the role of individual CEOs in explaining corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores. We show that CEO fixed-effects explain 63% of the variation in CSR scores, a significant portion of which is attributable to a CEO’s “materialism” (relatively high luxury asset ownership). Specifically, firms led by materialistic CEOs have lower CSR scores, and increases in CEOs’ materialism are associated with declining scores. Finally, CSR scores in firms with non-materialistic CEOs are positively associated with accounting profitability. In contrast, CSR scores in firms with materialistic CEOs are unrelated to profitability on average; however this association is decreasing in CEO power.
                        


                                New: Executives’ Legal Records and Insider Trading Activities
                            Date Posted:

                             2016
                            We examine how and why insider trading varies across senior executives and their firms. As predicted, the profitability of both purchases and sales are higher for “recordholder” executives (those who have a record of legal infractions), than for other “non-recordholder” executives at the same firms. The profitability of recordholder executives’ purchases and sales decrease significantly with proxies for strong information and governance environments, suggesting that recordholders have a relatively higher propensity to exploit inside information given the opportunity to do so. Finally, our classification of executives (recordholder status) can predict future returns and firm-specific information events.
                        


                                New: Bank CEO Materialism, Corporate Culture and Risk

                            We examine the extent to which bank CEOs exert influence on the corporate cultures of banking organizations by investigating how the prevalence of materialistic bank CEOs has evolved over time, and how observed risk management policies, the behavior of non-CEO executives and bank tail risk vary with bank CEO materialism. We document that between 1994 and 2004 the proportion of U.S. banks run by materialistic CEOs increased significantly in absolute terms and relative to non-financial firms, coinciding with significant bank deregulation. Using an index reflecting the strength of risk management functions (RMI), we find that RMI is significantly lower for banks with materialistic CEOs, significantly increases after a non-materialistic CEO replaces a materialistic CEO, and decreases after a materialistic CEO succeeds a non-materialistic one. We also provide evidence consistent with non-CEO executives in banks with materialistic CEOs more aggressively exploiting inside trading ...
                        


                                REVISION: Executives’ 'Off-the-Job' Behavior, Corporate Culture, and Financial Reporting Risk
                            Date Posted:

                            We examine how executives’ behavior outside the workplace, as measured by their ownership of luxury goods (low “frugality”) and prior legal infractions, is related to financial reporting risk. We predict and find that CEOs and CFOs with a legal record are more likely to perpetrate fraud. In contrast, we do not find a relation between executives’ frugality and the propensity to perpetrate fraud. However, as predicted, we find that unfrugal CEOs oversee a relatively loose control environment characterized by relatively high and increasing probabilities of other insiders perpetrating fraud and unintentional material reporting errors during their tenure. Further, cultural changes associated with an increase in fraud risk are more likely during unfrugal (vs. frugal) CEOs’ reign, including the appointment of an unfrugal CFO, an increase in executives’ equity-based incentives to misreport, and a decline in measures of board monitoring intensity.
                        


                                REVISION: Investment Cash Flow Sensitivities Really Reflect Related Investment Decisions

                            An important, unresolved issue in finance is whether the sensitivity of capital investment to internally generated cash flows reflects the impact of binding financing constraints on firms’ investment decisions. We contribute new insight to this debate by providing systematic evidence that investment-cash flow sensitivity (ICFS) primarily reflects the fundamental connection between capital investment and working capital investment as interrelated manifestations of firm growth. We decompose the ...
                        


                                New: Capital Allocation and Timely Accounting Recognition of Economic Losses

                            This paper explores direct relations between corporate investment behavior and the timeliness of accounting recognition of economic losses (TLR) reflected in a country’s accounting regime. We explicitly investigate the extent to which TLR influences investment decisions of firm managers. Given the asymmetric emphasis on negative outcomes inherent in TLR, we hypothesize that TLR will most strongly influence investment behavior when managers face deteriorating investment environments. We ...

                            Audited financial statements along with supporting disclosures form the foundation of the firm-specific information set available to investors and regulators.

They provide a framework for understanding the operation of accounting information in an economy, discuss a broad range of important research ...
                        


                                What Determines Corporate Transparency?

                            We investigate corporate transparency, defined as the availability of firm-specific information to those outside publicly traded firms, and viewed as the joint output of multi-faceted systems whose components collectively produce, gather, validate and disseminate information to market participants. We factor analyze an extensive range of measures capturing countries' firm-specific information environments, and isolate two factors interpreted as financial transparency and governance transparency.

We then propose that governance research be extended to explore more comprehensively the use of financial accounting information in additional corporate control mechanisms, and ...

                            Motivated by extant finance theory predicting that insider trading crowds out private information acquisition by outside investors, we use analyst following data for 100 countries for the years 1987-1998, to study whether analyst following increases following adoption of or the initial enforcement of insider trading legislation. We document that both the intensity of analyst coverage (average number of analysts covering followed firms within a country) and breadth of coverage (the proportion ...

                            The purpose of this paper is to investigate how governance systems of large public U.S. corporations vary with information properties of numbers produced by their financial accounting systems.  We argue that in firms whose current accounting numbers do a relatively poor job of capturing the effects of the firm's current activities and outcomes on shareholder value, the accounting numbers are less effective in the governance setting.  We predict that such firms will substitute costly governance ...
                        


                                An Analysis of the Relation Between the Stewardship and Valuation Roles of Earnings

                            We develop an agency-based model that provides a direct theoretical connection between compensation-earnings sensitivities (CERCs) and value-earnings sensitivities (ERCs). The model predicts that CERCs are increasing in ERCs. This relation between valuation and stewardship derives from the fact that the capitalization rate of earnings into value also influences the marginal product of current period actions that impact current earnings. Our empirical tests of the model provide evidence of a ...

                            The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence on whether there have been changes over time in the compensation-earnings relation. We investigate whether there is a trend during the period 1971-95 in the sensitivity of executive pay to reported earnings and in the importance of earnings relative to other information in explaining executive pay. As addressed in Gjesdal [1981] and in the model we develop, the relevance of a performance measure for valuing the firm may not be the same as its ...

(Keansburg Police)
KEANSBURG — The family of murdered 11-year-old Abbiegail “Abbie” Smith is trying to get her father allowed into the United States for her funeral.
Kenroy Smith was deported from the United States in 2001 on a drug charge and currently lives in Jamaica, according to ABC7 Eyewitness News. His family members said they are contacting lawmakers for help to allow him to attend Abbie’s funeral on Monday in Keansburg.
“I just want to see my daughter for the last time, please,” Kenroy Smith told the station.
UPDATE: Deported dad hopeful U.S. will allow him to attend slain Abbie’s funeral in NJ

Abbie’s older sister Kenish was denied a visa to attend, according to the report.
Abbie was born in Jamaica and moved with her family to the United States in 2007.
A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., told New Jersey 101.5 that the office has been in contact with the family and their attorney but would not elaborate further. A representative for U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the senator’s office is checking on the issue.
Abbie’s funeral is scheduled for Monday at St. Ann’s Church in Keansburg, with a viewing on Sunday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Jacqueline M. Ryan Home for Funerals.

Abbie’s body was found wrapped in a blanket on a rear roof of the Hancock Avenue apartment building where she lived with her mother, 12 hours after being reported missing on July 12.
Andreas Erazo, 18, who lived upstairs from Abbie, was arrested the next day and charged with first-degree murder. His detention hearing scheduled for Wednesday was delayed at the request of his lawyer until Wednesday, July 26 at 1:30 p.m., at the Monmouth County Courthouse in Freehold Borough.

KEANSBURG, N.J. — An 11-year-old girl was found dead Thursday, one day after she was reported missing from her family’s New Jersey apartment, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office.
Abbiegail "Abbie" Smith, 11, was found dead on July 13, 2017, a day after she was reported missing in New Jersey, officials say. (Keansburg Police Department)
Abbiegail Smith, also known as Abbie, was found dead at 10:45 a.m. Thursday, officials said at an afternoon news conference.
The 11-year-old was last seen in her apartment Wednesday around 7:45 p.m., and was realized to be missing around 8:50 p.m., according to the Keansburg Police Department.
Police have not said who reported Smith was missing.
Neighbors cannot believe the scene playing out along Hancock Street as investigators from the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office canvassed the neighborhood and tried to piece together the murder of Abbie.
"You get 11 years here and you have to have it end like that? It's just awful," one person said.
Oscar Rodriguez operates a Vape shop beside the apartment complex. His daughter Mary clutched his leg as he spoke to PIX 11 News.
"I have a 5-year-old daughter," Rodriguez said. "I have a few more kids. It hits home. It hits home. Nobody wants to see their child end up like that."
Smith's body was found nearly 15 hours after her mother last saw her at their first floor two-bedroom apartment.
The prosecutor's office did not release any specific details, only confirming that this is being investigated as a homicide.
Terence Reid lives a few yards from where Abbie was discovered, and shared with PIX 11 News what the neighboring building is like.
"It's quiet. It's actually quite quiet. We've never had any problems with anybody over there," Reid said.
When reminded that quiet area is now the scene of a murder investigation, Reid quickly said, "I know which is horrifying."
As residents gathered Thursday night to light candles and offer their condolences at a makeshift memorial, the fact remains that a killer is still on the loose.
The prosecutor's office has spoken with individuals in the apartment complex as well as around it, which is routine in any investigation.

            As a parent of a college freshman, this book gave me the perspective I needed to relate to what my daughter is encountering. I have been in a state of panic as she recounted all the things she is experiencing in just the first semester. The testimonials of the college students in Abbie Smith's book encouraged and reminded me that all Christian college students face a choice of faith. Specific examples are given of how they dealt with situations and what they learned that helped them to become stronger and more dependent on their Savior! (My daughter read it her Senior year, but I'm sending it to her to read again as now it will be more applicable!)

            Honest, frank words from students who have been there. This book is a must for high school graduates heading off to college who are looking for real answers to real questions they will encounter.

            Great book! Share this with your high school or college students. I've started giving it young men and women that are a part of my church at SDSU. Excellent and credible since it is written by those in the college trenches.
