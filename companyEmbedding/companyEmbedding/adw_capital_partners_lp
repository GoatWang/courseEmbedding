NEW YORK, May 22, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am very concerned about the current direction of Radiant Logistics, Inc. (AMEX:   RLGT) (the "Company") and management's sustained failure to generate shareholder value. In particular, the Company has been marked by stagnant growth, acquisition blunders, poor shareholder liquidity and material dilution, all resulting in a depressed share price. As management seems unable to correct this situation, and for the reasons outlined below, I urge the Company and the Board to immediately engage a financial advisor in order to explore a transaction with a strategic partner or acquirer. 
I have arrived at this conclusion for the following reasons:

The Company's average trading volume over the last 50 days has been a meek $60,000, with the stock failing to trade at all on some days. This dearth in liquidity seems to be largely the result of the shares being so closely held, with my internal estimates showing insiders (i.e. executive management and agent station owners), the Board, and a few institutions controlling over 80 percent of the stock. As these holders are keenly aware that their shares are grossly undervalued, very few shares are on the open market for sale so as to allow for stock appreciation. 
The public nature of the Company's mandatory investor disclosures is preventing management from sharing certain segment/unit information that I believe is necessary to attract serious investors, such as information about the Company's organic revenue growth, new franchise development and the implementation of new horizontal business lines. Unless management feels comfortable disclosing this information, I believe that it will be very hard for the Company to attract sufficient interest to justify remaining as an independent public company.
Given these facts, l urge the Company to explore a transaction with a synergistic strategic or financial partner who could provide (i) capital to accelerate the growth of the Company's business, (ii) economies of scale and other built-in infrastructure that would lower the Company's per capita operating costs and (iii) increased purchasing power. At the very least, the Company would benefit from the reduction of public company costs.
To give the Company an idea of the value I believe is being "left on the table" by remaining as an independent public company, just look at UTI Worldwide Inc.  While UTIW's business is not identical to the Company's, the two companies overlap substantially in their major product category – freight forwarding. However, UTIW currently trades at 12.5 X Total Enterprise Value to trailing twelve month EBITDA. After adjustments for non-recurring expenses, I believe that the Company should earn almost $14.0 mm of EBITDA in the next twelve months (ending June 2014).  If the Company were taken private by a strategic partner, I believe that the Company's business could save at least $4 mm in costs through the elimination of overhead -- at least $2 mm in executive salaries and an additional $2 mm in public company costs. If the Company were to go private through a transaction with a strategic partner like UTIW, with its "deep bench" of back office personnel and superior technology platform, it could result in meaningful cost reductions that could contribute at least another $2 mm to $3 mm in cost synergies. 
By my conservative estimates of FYE 2014 EBITDA, I believe that the Company could contribute roughly $20 mm of EBITDA to a new buyer in FYE 2014. Ascribing a multiple somewhere between 7.5x and 10.5x EBITDA, the Company could enjoy a share price in the ranges of $3.75 to $5.40 – roughly two to three times the value of the listed shares today. This valuation also ascribes zero value to the potential revenue synergies that would come from a platform acquirer that has already built out a sizable truck brokerage and customs brokerage division. (See Exhibit A below for reference).
I am asking management to do the right thing for ALL stakeholders today and refocus its effort on building shareholder value through a transaction with a strategic/financial partner. ADW Capital Partners, L.P. and its affiliates hold a sizable stake in the Company's basic shares and urge the Board to take these recommendations very seriously. I look forward to hearing your response.
Sincerely yours,
Adam D. Wyden
Managing Member of ADW Capital Partners, L.P.

NEW YORK, Aug. 6, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The following is a letter issued from Adam D. Wyden, Managing Member of ADW Capital Partners, L.P. to the Outerwall, Inc. Board of Directors:





August 5, 2013
 
Outerwall, Inc.
1800 114th Avenue SE
Bellevue, WA 98004


             




Dear Members of the Board of Directors,
As a shareholder of Outerwall, Inc. (the "Company"), we are very concerned about the Company's current direction. While the Company has seen EBITDA from its Redbox unit grow from roughly $50 mm in 2008 to over $400 mm expected in 2013, the Company's market capitalization has yet to reflect this growth. We believe that the Company's share appreciation has been stunted by investor concern over the long term viability of Redbox, management's inability to manage a mature business and effectively deploy capital beyond Redbox, along with the workings of an entrenched board that has very little invested in the Company. In order to reverse this situation, and create value for its shareholders, we strongly urge the Company to reduce its wasteful spending and return excess capital to its shareholders, most of whom have seen very little return from their investment over the past few years. In particular, we urge that the following actions be taken immediately:
Capital Allocation Initiatives:
1.   Optimize and Harvest Cash Flows at Redbox: Redbox is a mature asset and should be treated as such. While expansion in Canada and in the US may result in positive NPV projects, there are much higher returns available for the Company's capital.
2.   Eliminate New Ventures Segment: Supplementing the Company's renewed focus on optimizing and harvesting Redbox, we think it is in the Company's best interest to shut down its "New Ventures" segment. The Company will spend between $30 and $40 mm dollars in FY 2013 on unproven concepts that have produced little to no revenue to date and we are highly skeptical that these concepts will produce meaningful revenue anytime soon.
What the Company does have experience doing is taking a proven concept – a $100 mm + revenue business and bringing it to the masses. We believe the Company has this opportunity in ecoATM and should focus its time, energy, and capital on this proven concept with very attractive return-on-investment characteristics.
3.   Restructure / Eliminate Redbox Instant Joint Venture with Verizon: While we admire the Company's ambition to become a tier three player in the streaming video-on-demand space, we also recognize its challenges. With fierce competitors like Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, and iTunes, we question Redbox's ability to go up against established players with substantial libraries and even more substantial financial resources. The capital commitments that the Company needs to sustain to keep its ownership stake in "Instant" are rising quickly and there are much more "certain" places the Company can deploy the capital in the meantime.
4.   The Company is substantially under-levered: While we believe that the longevity of Redbox is far greater than the "market" expects, it faces long-term challenges. However, if Redbox experiences an accelerated decline, it would create an even greater sense of urgency to reduce capital expenditures and begin returning capital to shareholders as quickly as possible. We believe the Company has an extraordinary opportunity to borrow money at record low rates today. Given the Company's modest maintenance capital requirements going forward, we believe the Company could increase its leverage profile to roughly a modest 1.2x 2015 Net Debt / EBITDA and still have substantial cash flow to fund shareholder distributions and the growth of ecoATM.
5.   Dramatically Increase Share Repurchases through an Accelerated-Stock-Repurchase Program or Tender Offer: We acknowledge that the Company has periodically returned capital to shareholders through various share repurchase programs. Unfortunately, the Company has been limited in its scope and scale of these initiatives due to the expanding capital requirements of Redbox and its various "New Ventures." If the Company were to pare its spending on Redbox and eliminate its new ventures spending, we believe the Company could generate more than enough free cash flow to service its debt, continue to grow ecoATM, and reward its patient shareholders today with a very accretive transaction.
We have built a basic financial model outlining the financial outcome of our proposed changes. We have used the mid-point of the Company's 2013 EBITDA projections and its year ending 2013 expected cash balance pro-forma for the ecoATM transaction as our starting points. We then added our expected contribution from an accelerated ecoATM rollout in 2014 and 2015, while eliminating the effect of the Company's new ventures segment. Our model also assumes that the Company repurchases 30 percent of its diluted shares outstanding (roughly 8.4 mm shares) at an average price of $65.00. While repurchasing this much of the stock at these prices may be unrealistic, the outcome is staggering. We believe the Company could pay up to $100.00 a share to retire 30 percent of its outstanding stock and still be able to consummate a very accretive transaction for remaining shareholders. 
In hindsight, the Board's choices regarding capital allocation appear tight-fisted and are even more disheartening in light of the rapid growth of the Company's Redbox segment. Bluntly speaking, we don't think the Company is doing enough. With a cash position of almost 1x EBITDA, we believe the Company is approximately 2x full turns of leverage below comparable mature companies despite its relatively lower capital intensity and higher cash generation abilities.
We also note that the Board has almost no ownership of the Company's shares even after receiving ample share-based compensation for its services over the years. This disparity raises serious concerns about the current Board's sense of urgency and its alignment of interests with shareholders.  We are aware that our concerns and beliefs are shared by other shareholders and were previously presented to the Board and Management, only to later be ignored. Also, we understand from various media outlets that the Board rejected a Private Equity firm's offer to acquire the Company last summer at a substantial premium to its current market valuation. Perhaps such actions are explained by the fact no board member, or member of management, has made a single open market acquisition of Company shares since August of 2003, and thus has very little invested in the Company's stock appreciation. 
We are asking the Board and Management to do what is right for the Company's shareholders to whom the Board has a fiduciary duty.  It is our belief that successful execution of the initiatives outlined in this letter will reward the Company's patient shareholders, many of whom have earned zero return in recent years on their investment.
ADW Capital Partners, L.P. and its affiliates hold a sizable stake in the Company's common shares and urge the board to take our recommendations seriously. We look forward to hearing your response.
Sincerely yours,
Adam D. Wyden
Managing Member of ADW Capital Partners, L.P.

("ADW Capital") and Eric Shahinian of Camac Partners, LLC ("Camac"), New York City based investment firms, transmitted today a letter to the board of directors and management of Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc. (the "Company" or "Imvescor") (IRG.TO) seeking a strategic sale of the Company. ADW Capital and Camac along with their affiliates (which collectively hold approximately 16.4% of the Company's shares and warrants) believe that in seeking a strategic/financial partner it will ensure that the Company can best continue on its growth plan while maximizing shareholder value.Found below is the full text of the fund's letter to the Company:August 22, 2016Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc.c/o François-Xavier Seigneur, Chairman8250 Decarie Suite 310Montreal, QC H4P 2P5 CanadaDear Board and Management of Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc. (IRG.TO),We would like to begin by commending the Board and management on the Company's successful turnaround and implementation of its restaurant rejuvenation plan. Specifically, we think the hiring of Frank Hennessy almost two years ago has brought a great deal of stability and focus to an organization that had been orphaned of leadership and strategy for many years prior. To that end, it is not surprising that the operational results have followed suit with a material reversal in same store sales trends and increased profitability at both the franchisee and corporate levels. We also expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future.As you know, ADW Capital and Camac have been long-term shareholders of the Company with certain purchases dating back almost 5 years. We have also almost unilaterally approved with the capital markets and operational decisions the Company has made in the last few years, including its recent implementation of a quarterly dividend. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, we believe the Company is at a crossroads today and as likely its two largest shareholders, believe we have identified the most advantageous path for the Company going forward. Frankly, we do not think it makes sense for Imvescor to continue as a publicly "traded" entity and that it should hire a financial advisor to pursue a sale of the Company immediately, if you have not done so already.We have arrived at this conclusion for the following reasons:While the Company has averaged trading volume of ~ CAD $330,000 over the last 200 days, the Company has gone days in the not-too-distant past without trading a single share. This lack of trading activity is due in large part to the very closely held nature of the shares today. We estimate across a few select institutions/shareholders, over 50 percent of the Company's shares are in firm hands and are not "for sale."We think it is fair to assume that these shares are not "for sale" because the Company's concentrated investor base (many of whom have owned its shares for several years now) have followed its progress closely and recognize the Company's continued discounted value and business trajectory.In addition to the sparse liquidity barring new investors from taking a meaningful stake in the Company, Management has been unwilling to share certain segment/unit information in its disclosures and generally engage in open dialog with its shareholders about its long-term growth and monetization strategy.We believe the Company could ameliorate this issue and continue growing with the help of the right strategic/financial partner. In addition to being able to provide capital to accelerate the growth of Imvescor's platform, which is already taking hold, we think the Company could benefit immensely from substantial cost and revenue synergies by joining with a larger strategic partner while not being burdened by the disclosure requirements of being an independent public company. Perhaps most relevant to our analysis is that we think a transaction benefits all the Company's stakeholders -- franchisees included! In our conversations with franchisees, owners often cite high food costs and burdensome payments for their share of advertising costs. If the Company were to merge with a strategic partner, some of the savings from combined food procurement and pooled advertising could be shared with the Company's franchisees.In fiscal 2015, Corporate G&A, ex one-time restructuring charges, amounted to approximately CAD $8.7 MM. It is our belief that additional corporate costs may also be getting allocated to the Company's "Franchising" segment. Notwithstanding any such allocation, we believe a strategic partner could reduce at minimum CAD $10 MM costs from the platform inclusive of procurement savings on ~ CAD $400 MM of system sales. We expect the Company to earn on a standalone basis roughly CAD $21 - 22 MM of EBITDA in Fiscal 2017, with minimal maintenance capital expenditures. In the hands of the right strategic buyer, we could expect Imvescor's contribution to approximate CAD $31 -- 32 MM of EBITDA. At a multiple of 8.0x to 10x this would amount to exit values of CAD $4.10 - 5.30 per share.It should also not be lost on Management and the board that control premiums in the marketplace for portfolios of franchised restaurants are at record highs as evidenced by the recent St. Hubert and Kahala Brands acquisitions. We think the Company could structure a stock-for-stock transaction (or partial cash and stock) with a larger public company that would allow current shareholders to receive a premium for their stock, while allowing them to participate in the tremendous value and synergy Imvescor will add to the new platform.Another interesting option for the Company would be to explore a transaction with a financial buyer. Given the durability and predictability of franchise restaurant company cash flows, companies like Imvescor are favored for platform roll-up strategies. A well-capitalized private equity firm could take advantage of Imvescor's lower Canadian tax base, coupled with a low cost of debt capital, and use it as a platform to roll up additional franchise concepts. Or better yet, many private equity firms already have portfolios of franchise restaurants and could inure many of the same strategic cost saves (as well as tax basis savings) by combining their portfolios with Imvescor.Read MoreWe are asking management to do the right thing for all stakeholders today. By seeking a strategic/financial partner at this stage in the game, it will ensure that the Company can grow significantly without many of the competitive risks of staying a small and illiquid independent public company.ADW Capital Partners, L.P. and Camac Partners, LLC and its affiliates collectively hold approximately 16.4% of the Company's shares and urge the board to take our recommendations seriously.We look forward to hearing your response.Adam D.

ADW Capital Partners L.P. Seeks Review of Dividend Policy of Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc.
			  



























































 
















NEW YORK, Feb. 19, 2014 /CNW Telbec/ - Adam Wyden of ADW Capital
 Partners, L.P. ("ADW Capital"), a New York City based hedge fund,
 transmitted yesterday a letter to the board of directors and management
 of Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc. (the "Company") (TSX: IRG) seeking a
 review of the current dividend policy for the Company.  ADW Capital
 along with its affiliates hold approximately 4% of the Company on a
 non-diluted basis.


Found below is the full text of Mr. Wyden's letter to the Company:



February 18, 2014


Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc.
c/o Denis Richard, President and Chief Executive Officer
774 Main Street, Suite 400
Moncton, NB
E1C 9Y3


Dear Board and Management of Imvescor Restaurant Group, Inc.,


ADW Capital Partners L.P. and its affiliates currently own approximately
 4.0% of the outstanding common stock of Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc.
 ("Imvescor" or the "Company") and additional shares upon conversion of
 warrants, making us one of the Company's largest shareholders. We would
 like to commend the board and management on the beginning of a
 successful turnaround of the Company. We are also excited about the
 return of Denis Richard as CEO. However, now that the Company has
 proven its ability to generate consistent free cash flow, we believe it
 is time for Imvescor to reinstate its dividend to reward patient
 shareholders and to ensure financial discipline. We have come to this
 conclusion for several reasons:


The Company has strong recurring cash flow TODAY:


While the market responded poorly to Imvescor's Q4 2013 earnings release
 on January 24, we were impressed by the recurring cash flows Imvescor
 generated. Though Imvescor reported Adjusted EBITDA of $14.6 million
 for 2013, we believe recurring EBITDA was actually much higher. Legal
 fees of $1.8 million and lease exit costs of $1.4 million added up to
 $3.2 million in 2013, almost twice the average for the past three years
 of $1.7 million and much higher than 2012's $1.1 million. If we accept
 the $1.7 million figure as the recurring level of costs, recurring 2013
 EBITDA for the Company was closer to $16.1 million. In all likelihood
 as operations normalize, we believe this number should approximate
 $500k to $800k (almost $2.5 million in savings from current levels).
 Adding in the $2 million of incremental EBITDA that can be expected
 from the recent Commensal acquisition and additional retail sales, and
 Imvescor should generate at LEAST $18.1 million in EBITDA going forward. If we are to reverse the recent
 stock based compensation (which is non-cash) the number is closer to
 $19 million.


At $18.1 million in EBITDA, Imvescor is left with around $12 million in
 levered free cash flow. We believe over time Imvescor should pay out
 about 85 percent of its free cash flow to shareholders, implying
 approximately $10.5 million in annual dividends. At 53 million diluted
 shares outstanding, the suggested dividend would be around 20 cents per
 share.


Peers appear to be valued on dividend yield:


Imvescor's four closest public comps each pay significant dividends and
 investors have rewarded them for it. A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund
 (AW.UN), Boston Pizza Royalties Income Fund (BPF.UN), Keg Royalties
 Income Fund (KEG.UN), and Pizza Pizza Royalty Corp. (PZA) each trade at
 dividend yields of 5.0%-6.0%. If Imvescor were to pay an annual
 dividend of 20 cents per share, such a dividend yield should produce a
 valuation range of $3.00 to $4.00 per share, substantially higher than
 Imvescor's current stock price of $1.90.


The Company is underlevered and mispriced:


Imvescor is well-capitalized considering the Company's reliable
 franchise revenues and low capital expenditures. While we are open to
 opportunistic/transformational acquisitions like that of Commensal at
 attractive multiples (2x - 3x Pro Forma EBITDA), we believe Imvescor
 should not set aside cash for M&A. Rather, if the Company's cash cannot
 cover an acquisition, the Company should take on additional debt given
 the attractiveness of the transaction relative to its market value. We
 believe that taking on debt will command discipline out of the
 Company's management team and only allow them to pursue deals that are
 truly accretive (low multiple - 2x - 3x).


On a side note, we believe re-instating a dividend will give the market
 confidence in the Company's ability to generate consistent and
 recurring free cash flow and reward it with a substantially higher
 multiple as the peer group indicates. We believe this will provide a
 currency for future accretive M&A, open the Company up to higher
 multiple deals (when stock price reflects full fair value), and offer
 an alternative to using leverage.


We believe the Company has significant avenues for internal growth going
 forward that are not substantially capital intensive: a return to unit growth at Baton Rouge, a successful rollout of the
 Scores Express concept, the introduction of additional SKU's in the
 retail segment, and most importantly, the massive revenue opportunity
 from in-sourcing the franchise system supply-chain with Commensal.


Currently the Company has approximately $400 million of system-wide
 sales. The Commensal acquisition provides the opportunity for our
 franchisees to purchase their food products directly from the Company.
 We believe this ensures quality control for the Company and offers the
 opportunity for our franchisees' to lower their cost of goods. For
 illustration purposes, if the Company was able to replace a third-party
 as the primary supplier of $50 million of the franchisees' food costs
 at a 15 percent EBITDA margin that would lead to $7.5 million of
 incremental EBITDA (far in excess of the Company's projections).


It is noteworthy that the Company's G&A expenses approach the same
 levels of MTY Food Group - a company with twice the revenues. We expect
 the Company over time to identify cost savings and grow into its cost
 base through the organic growth initiatives outlined above. If this is
 not possible, we believe it is in the best interest of shareholders to
 pursue efforts to successfully monetize some or all of the Company's
 assets to a larger strategic player who can better leverage their own
 cost structure.


We have worked constructively and successfully with small companies in
 the US and Canada over the last several years. We urge the board to
 take our recommendations seriously, and we look forward to hearing your
 response.


Sincerely yours,


Adam D. Wyden
Managing Member of ADW Capital Partners, L.P.

ADW Capital Partners 4Q16 Investor Letter: 27 Percent CAGR







































































 
























ADW Capital Partners 4Q16 Letter – 27% CAGR

ADW Capital Partners 2016 letter to investors
Dear Partners,
ADW Capital Up 25.19% In 2016
2016 Hedge Fund Letters
It is our pleasure to report results for the 4th quarter of 2016 and our 24th quarter since inception.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we want to reiterate a critical point discussed in all quarterly letters. ADW Capital Partners, L.P. (the “Fund”) operates a concentrated, tax-sensitive and long-term strategy designed to minimize correlation to the broader indices with a focus on avoiding permanent capital loss. Inevitably, this approach will result in periods of underperformance. By the same token, our efforts to maintain a lower correlation strategy driven by company-specific outcomes may produce significant outperformance in periods of market weakness, as we saw in 2011. We are not traders, return chasers or month-to-month stock jockeys. We are investors who look for opportunities to return multiples on the Fund’s capital in a tax-efficient manner over an extended period of time. While this strategy may yield lumpy results, we believe it limits idea dilution and protects the Fund’s returns from Uncle Sam and Wall Street.
ADW Capital Partners
ADW Capital Partners – “Stick to the Script to Stay in the Movie”:
WOW. +25.2 percent for 2016 and returns of ~27 percent for six years. It could intoxicate even the best of us. Better yet, the fund is already off to a roaring start in January…It is so easy to get caught up in the noise, hysteria, and cacophony that is the “institutional hedge fund business”. Let’s be clear here. We don’t believe we run a prototypical “hedge fund”. For those of you familiar with my background, ADW Capital was birthed out of a personal lifetime passion for investing and need to “get leverage on my own best ideas”. There were no Monte Carlo simulations run to target Sortino or Sharpe Ratios or differential equations to target ideal leverage and position sizes. In the olden days, “hedge fund” really meant a fund that does not have a single mandate to make money – as long as they made money. Long, short, sideways, it didn’t matter if you were creating value for your customers. It also meant that you were allowed to charge modest fees to your investors because you earned them by consistently outperforming your benchmarks net of fees.
Today the industry is plagued with too many players and investors with unrealistic expectations about volatility, liquidity, concentration, and targeted exposures.
Why have we been successful while others have struggled? The answer is quite simple: YOU. Because I love what I do so much, I have been able to build a business that has allowed me to invest the way I would invest personally – chunky positions, long hold times / low turnover, and use volatility as a tool as opposed to letting it cripple me. I was very fortunate to not get a single call from an unhappy investor while the fund was going through a greater than 20 percent drawdown through the end of 2015 and into 2016. In fact, I got many words of encouragement and a few checks too, to add to our names we had increasing conviction in. As you might recall from this year’s earlier letters, all of our companies reported tremendous 4th quarter results and were tirelessly creating value that the market for one reason or another didn’t care about at that fine moment. But it was because of you – our army of almost seventy likeminded limited partners that we did not retreat but we in fact “doubled down”. While there are always “shortcuts” available to those anxious to get somewhere in a hurry, we are proud of the business we have built and the loyal partners that have built it. We believe it presents an excellent foundation for the future. Furthermore, we believe this excellent foundation “allowed us to stick to script, so we could stay in the movie”. Had we accepted limited partners who had short term goals different than our own, could it have affected what we would have done in those more difficult moments earlier in the year? Certainly. In fact, I would go as far as to say that that is perhaps the single biggest problem in the fund business today. Managers are running their portfolios to meet unrealistic investor expectations as opposed to managing them for long term results. Fortunately, we have self-selected away from that investor cohort and have built a business I can run for the rest of my life and at some point even my progeny.
So, this is a long winded way of saying that after six years, I am very thankful for the kind words, support, and loyalty of our partners. While I cannot promise things will always go up and to the right, I can promise you that our resolve has never been stronger. So thank you for creating an environment to let me go to war for you every-day.
To that end, we will not be talking about current or prospective investments in this letter. It has become quite evident that there are a number of “home gamers” who get their hands on our letters and are trying to replicate our positions/portfolio. As many of you are aware, we are actively raising funds to increase our pro-rata stakes in many of our positions and by no means want to “front-run” ourselves or you. My allegiances are firmly to the current partners of ADW Capital Partners, L.P. – myself being the largest.
If current partners are interested in giving me, my mom, and the rest of the ADW family a hug or learning more about what we are up to in a controlled environment, I encourage you to come to our meeting next month.
Operational Update/Conclusion:
This will be a little repetitive… In connection with the growth of the firm and based on reverse inquiry, we have decided to host our first annual meeting / breakfast the morning of February 16th at Jefferies in NYC. While the meeting is reserved for existing limited partners, we may have select availability for a few “serious fans”. Please let us know if you would be interested in attending as we need contact info for security.
We want to thank all of you again for the opportunity to steward your capital and look forward to many more years with you as partners.
As always, we are available to answer any and all of your questions regarding the operations of the Fund or about the exciting opportunity set we are currently deploying capital into.
Regards,
Adam D. Wyden

"I was amazed to receive my order within four days of placing it especially since it went by regular shipping and I am in California and ADW Diabetes is in Florida. That means that it was received, packed and shipped within 24 hours. Very impressive. And, when I sent the company a congratulatory email, they replied within an hour. I will be a repeat customer with this company."
