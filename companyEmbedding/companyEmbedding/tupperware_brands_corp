Heritage

Tupperware® brand products made their debut in 1946, the start of a revolutionary post-war period in history. For 60 years, Tupperware brand products have closely followed rollercoaster trends from the suburban movement to the 60's feminist revolution to '90s "cocooning" continually adding a unique organizational touch to the lives and kitchens across the nation.






Just prior to its consumer introduction in 1946, inventor Earl Tupper's plastics-like materials of many manufacturers were dedicated to the war effort. The versatility and convenience of Tupper's "miracle" products helped to launch the plastics revolution of the next decade. Tupper's first consumer plastic products the Wonderlier® Bowl and Bell Tumbler offered a unique benefit that traditional food containers did not: they were lighter and less likely to break than traditional glass and crockery.
With the onset of the post-war "baby boom," women dedicated themselves to caring for their growing families. The "Tupperized" kitchen was born … a kitchen that was well organized and neat, and featured a variety of containers that replaced unsightly open packages and that kept food fresh longer.
In 1946, Tupper introduced his legendary airtight seals patterned after the inverted rim on a can of paint which prevented food from drying out, wilting or losing its flavor in the now-common refrigerator. Despite their breakthrough nature, Tupper's products didn't sell well in retail outlets, primarily because consumers needed demonstrations in order to understand how they worked.
In response, the first Tupperware Home Party was held in 1948, introducing an all-new way for Tupperware products to reach consumers. Demonstrations proved a dramatically effective way of communicating the benefits of the revolutionary seal.
By 1951, the Tupperware Home Demonstration system was working so well that all Tupperware products were taken off store shelves to be distributed in this manner. The direct sales demonstration was a welcome diversion for women, whose involvement in the community mostly revolved around their family.
Selling Tupperware products via the party sales method was an appealing career for these women, who had few career opportunities after their men returned from the war. As consumers relocated from large urban centers to homes in the suburbs, backyard barbecues became a favorite way for families and neighbors to spend leisure time. The new Tupperware products answered needs created by this popular pastime. The Party Bowl kept macaroni and egg salads fresh and cold outdoors, while The Pie Taker provided easy transportation for homemade desserts. The Dip 'N Serve™ Serving Tray functioned much the same way, making it simple to get chips and dip to and from the backyard or the picnic site.
The '60s were times of social upheaval with the family undergoing social changes. As two-income families became more common, women actively pursued career opportunities and Tupperware filled the ensuing product niche with designs like the Traveling Desk, Drawer Organizers, and the Plastic Carrying Case.
The huge wave of baby boomers that began having children of their own created a need for sturdy, stimulating toys. Again Tupperware rose to the challenge, introducing an innovative line of toys like the Shape-O® toy, a fun-yet-educational design which challenged each stage of a child's development from functioning as a rattle for infants to promoting eye-hand coordination in toddlers. While the demand for specialized kitchen products soared, Tupperware kept pace with changing palates by offering storage products like the Mix 'N Stor® Container, and the Tortilla Keeper for serving ethnic dishes.
Thanks to advances in medical technology, consumers were living longer than ever before, resulting in an increasing population of seniors. During this era, Tupperware introduced the Instant Seal, which catered to a mature population with not-so-nimble fingers.
This era also brought drastically changing lifestyles with more households than ever before requiring dual incomes to meet increasing economic demands. More women went to work outside the home faced with balancing their roles in the office and the home. A career in Tupperware offered these new entrants to the workforce a flexible way to earn money and spend time with their children.
When microwave ovens first began entering kitchens, Tupperware introduced products designed specifically for both the microwave and conventional ovens. Once the microwave was fully accepted as a household appliance, Tupperware introduced products exclusively for the appliance such as the Microwave Reheatables line and TupperWave lines, which could warm up leftovers or cook the frozen foods that were becoming more and more a family staple.
In keeping with the fast-paced '80s, Tupperware introduced products designed to maximize people's time. The TupperWave® Stack Cooker was designed to make a three-course meal for four in the microwave in 30 minutes allowing a busy population to have traditional family dinners while the Meals in Minutes Microsteamer prepared a fresh meal for two in 10 minutes or less. Modular Mates™ containers provided a storage system that could be custom-tailored to store staple foods in bulk, cutting down on waste and stretching grocery budgets and kitchen storage space.
In response to growing environmental awareness, Tupperware containers offered positive alternatives to disposable wrap and packaging, including the Square-A-Way® sandwich keeper, the Box Lunch and the Lunch 'N Bag sets.
The CrystalWave™ line of microwaveable food storage containers featured Braille and metric capacity measurements, reflecting Tupperware's continued responsiveness to consumer needs.
The 1990's trends reflected a renewed emphasis on the home and traditional comforts such as home-cooked meals. Right in step with this trend, Tupperware launched an expanded product line of contemporary-design kitchen tools made with Tupperware's signature quality and ingenuity the Peeler Plus, the Coffee House Set, and the Double Colander combined traditional kitchenware with a '90s sophisticated savvy.
By 1992, nearly half of all Tupperware consultants held full-time jobs in addition to selling Tupperware products. In deference to a trend toward "one-stop shopping," the company introduced "Value for Time" classes and "Custom Kitchen Planning" demonstrations, where customers learned about microwave cooking and food preparation, as well as ways to save money on their grocery bills, valuable cabinet space and time. In addition, "Rush Hour" and "Office" parties allowed Tupperware demonstrations to fit the busy schedules of time-pressed customers.
Just as Earl Tupper's early plastic products revolutionized food storage and preparation, today's Tupperware products continue to enhance lifestyles by offering ingenious design, quality construction and a lifetime warranty. During the 21st century, the world will continue to change, and Tupperware will continue to evolve right along with it, using a modern approach to form and function to create convenient solutions to households tasks.
Tupperware now reaches nearly 100 markets around the world, offering culturally distinct items such as the Kimchi Keeper, the Kimono Keeper and the Japanese Bento Box.
In the new millennium, consumers can count on the same quality of Tupperware products representing extraordinary design for everyday living. Moreover, in today's information-age busy consumers can be sure of Tupperware's expansion into new channels such as the Internet and shopping mall showcases to meet societal change in marketplaces around the world.

History[edit]
Tupperware Brands Corporation was founded as The Tupperware Company in 1946 in South Grafton, Massachusetts by Earl Tupper. In 1958, Tupper sold The Tupperware Company for $16 million to Rexall and the company's headquarters were moved to Orlando, Florida. In December 2005, Tupperware Corporation changed its name to Tupperware Brands Corporation to reflect the company's increasing product diversity.
Brands[edit]
A decade after starting business in the United States, Tupperware expanded into Europe. By 1965, the company had a presence in six European countries and then launched in Singapore, Japan and Australia. Tupperware also had sales offices in Africa and Latin America before 1970. After that, Tupperware Brands expanded to almost 100 countries around the world under seven brands connected to it: the brands Tupperware, Avroy Shlain, BeautiControl, Fuller, NaturCare, Nutrimetics and Nuvo.[3] In 2008, due to its success in developing the brand's name in China, India and Indonesia, Tupperware received awards for "Most Favored Brand by Women" and "Company with the Best Corporate Face."[4]

Tupperware shares jump 12% after earnings beat and improved outlook
Shares of food container maker Tupperware Brands Corp.  surged more than 12% Tuesday, after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the first quarter and raised its outlook for the rest of the year. The stock now stands at its highest level since Sept. 2014. Tupperware posted adjusted per-share earnings of $1.01, or 7 cents above the FactSet consensus. It had sales of $555 million, above the FactSet consensus of $532 million. Chief Executive Rick Goings said sales were driven by 9% growth in emerging markets, led by Brazil, China, Tupperware Mexico and Tupperware South Africa. That helped offset weakness in Indonesia, where sales fell 9%. Shares have gained 39% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 6%.

Tupperware shares jump 12% after earnings beat and improved outlook
Shares of food container maker Tupperware Brands Corp.  surged more than 12% Tuesday, after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the first quarter and raised its outlook for the rest of the year. The stock now stands at its highest level since Sept. 2014. Tupperware posted adjusted per-share earnings of $1.01, or 7 cents above the FactSet consensus. It had sales of $555 million, above the FactSet consensus of $532 million. Chief Executive Rick Goings said sales were driven by 9% growth in emerging markets, led by Brazil, China, Tupperware Mexico and Tupperware South Africa. That helped offset weakness in Indonesia, where sales fell 9%. Shares have gained 39% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 6%.

Why Tupperware Brands Corp. Rose 14.5% in April
The direct-sales expert's increasingly diverse product catalog and wider geographic reach are paying off on the bottom line.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            May 12, 2017 at 1:49PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of  Tupperware Brands (NYSE:TUP) gained 14.5% in April 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
So what
The longtime specialist in social sales networking reported first-quarter sales and earnings that rose above the top end of management's guidance ranges, easily exceeding Wall Street's consensus estimates. The company posted revenue and earnings per share growth of 6% and 11% year-over-year, respectively. Management gave credit for the surprise to solid fundamentals, plus an effective digital-sales strategy, and Tupperware shares skyrocketed 12% higher the next morning. The stock has been trading near two-year highs since.

Now what
Tupperware's sales are on the rebound after a couple of difficult years, and share prices have followed suit. My fellow Fool Seth McNew likes the company's newfound love of diversification, in both products and markets. Two-thirds of its sales now derive from high-growth markets like Mexico and China. And its well-known range of household storage containers and other kitchenware has been joined by new lines such as cosmetics and skin care products.

TUP data by YCharts
You can buy Tupperware shares for just 14.5 times forward earnings today. They come with a solid -- but admittedly stagnant -- dividend. Tupperware hasn't raised its quarterly payout since early 2014, but the dividend yield still works out to a generous 3.7%.
All told, Tupperware is starting to look like a successful turnaround story. Strategy changes like the company's international foray tend to hurt in the short term, and this one certainly did. But investors are starting to reap the long-term rewards of that sacrifice now.

Tupperware is the name of a home products line that includes preparation, storage, containment, and serving products for the kitchen and home. It also includes plastic containers used to store goods and/or food. In 1942, Earl Tupper developed his first bell shaped container; the brand products were introduced to the public in 1948.
Tupperware develops, manufactures, and internationally distributes its products as a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company Tupperware Brands. It is marketed by means of approximately 1.9 million direct salespeople on contract.[2]
In 2013, the top marketplace of Tupperware was Indonesia, which toppled Germany as the second. Indonesia's last year sales were more than $200 million with 250,000 sales persons.[3]

Company history[edit]




Tupperware containers from 2011


Tupperware was developed in 1946 by Earl Silas Tupper (1907–83) in Leominster, Massachusetts.[4] He developed plastic containers used in households to contain food and keep it airtight. The once-patented "burping seal" is a famous aspect of Tupperware, which distinguished it from competitors. Earl Tupper invented the plastic for Tupperware already in 1938, but the product only worked with the emergence of the sale through presentation in a party setting. In 1949, Tupperware introduced the 'Wonderlier Bowl' that gave a start to a revolutionary range of kitchen utensils.
Tupperware pioneered the direct marketing strategy made famous by the Tupperware party. The Tupperware Party allowed for women of the 1950s to work and enjoy the benefits of earning an income without completely taking away the independence granted to women during the Second World War when women first began entering the labor market, all the while keeping their focus in the domestic domain.[5] The "Party" model builds on characteristics generally developed by being a housewife (e.g., party planning, hosting a party, sociable relations with friends and neighbors) and created an alternative choice for women who either needed or wanted to work. Brownie Wise (1913–92) realized Tupperware's potential as a fun commodity. She realized, however, that she had to be creative and therefore started to throw these Tupperware parties. Wise, a former sales representative of Stanley Home Products, developed the strategy. Tupper was so impressed that Brownie Wise was made vice president of marketing in 1951. Wise soon created Tupperware Parties Inc.[6]
During the early 1950s, Tupperware's sales and popularity exploded, thanks in large part to Wise's influence among women who sold Tupperware, and some of the famous "jubilees" celebrating the success of Tupperware ladies at lavish and outlandishly themed parties. Tupperware was known—at a time when women came back from working during World War II only to be told to "go back to the kitchen"[7]—as a method of empowering women, and giving them a toehold in the postwar business world.[8][9][10]
The tradition of Tupperware's "Jubilee" style events continues to this day, with rallies being held in major cities to recognize and reward top-selling and top-recruiting individuals, teams, and organizations.
In 1958, Earl Tupper fired Wise over general difference of opinion in the Tupperware business operation. Officially, Tupper objected to the expenses incurred by the jubilee and other similar celebrations of Tupperware.[11] However, the real reason was that Tupper had been approached by several companies interested in buying him out; he felt that he would not be able to sell with a woman in an executive position.[12] Rexall bought Tupperware in 1958.
Tupperware spread to Europe in 1960 when Mila Pond hosted a Tupperware party in Weybridge, England, and subsequently around the world. At the time, a strict dress code was required for Tupperware ladies, with skirts and stockings (tights) worn at all times, and white gloves often accompanying the outfit.[13] A technique called "carrot calling" helped promote the parties: representatives would travel door to door in a neighborhood and ask housewives to "run an experiment" in which carrots would be placed in a Tupperware container and compared with "anything that you would ordinarily leave it in"; it would often result in the scheduling of a Tupperware party.[13]
Rexall sold its namesake drugstores in 1977, and renamed itself Dart Industries. Dart merged with Kraftco to form Dart & Kraft. The company demerged, with the former Dart assets named Premark International. Tupperware Brands was spun off from Premark in 1996; Premark was acquired by Illinois Tool Works three years later.[citation needed]
In 2003, Tupperware closed down operations in the UK and Ireland, citing customer dissatisfaction with their direct sales model.[14] There has been limited importer-distribution since then.[15] The company announced a formal relaunch in the UK in mid-2011,[16] and recruited UK staff, but in December the relaunch was cancelled.[17]
Tupperware is now sold in almost 100 countries, after peaking at more than a hundred after 1996.[18]
Tupperware parties[edit]




A Tupperware party in the 1950s







This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Tupperware is still sold mostly through a party plan, with rewards for hosts. A Tupperware party is run by a Tupperware "consultant" for a host who invites friends and neighbors into his or her home to see the product line. Tupperware hosts are rewarded with free products based on the level of sales made at their party. Parties also take place in workplaces, schools, and other community groups.
In most countries, Tupperware's sales force is organized in a tiered structure with consultants at the bottom, managers and star managers over them, and next various levels of directors, with Legacy Executive Directors at the top level. In recent years, Tupperware has done away with distributorships in the United States. This has allowed Tupperware more flexibility and generous commissions and rewards for their consultants. [citation needed]
In recent years, Tupperware in North America has moved to a new business model which includes more emphasis on direct marketing channels and eliminated its dependency on authorized distributorships. This transition included selling through Target stores in the U.S., and Superstores in Canada, with disappointing results. Tupperware states this hurt direct sales.[19] In countries with a strong focus on marketing through parties (such as Germany, Australia, and New Zealand), Tupperware's market share and profitability continue to decline.[citation needed]
In many countries, Tupperware products come with a lifetime guarantee. In the UK/Ireland the guarantee is 10 years.[20] The company is best known for its plastic bowls and storage containers. However, in recent years it has branched out into stainless steel cookware, fine cutlery, chef's knives, and other kitchen gadgets. After experiencing a slump in sales and public image in the mid-1990s, the company created several new product lines to attract a younger market.
In some countries including Belgium, Australia, Ireland and the U.S., Tupperware markets their parties and career opportunities through mall kiosks from time to time.
In China, Tupperware products are sold through franchised "entrepreneurial shopfronts", of which there were 1,900 in 2005, due to pyramid selling laws enacted in 1998.[21][22] The Chinese characters 特百惠 are used as the brand name, and translate as "hundred benefit".
Cultural and historical impact[edit]




Typical authentic Tupperware


Tupperware created a way for women to remain housewives while creating an independence from the home in a sociable atmosphere.[23]
The reciprocity that emerges at the “parties,” which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess, creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling. Studies show that the creation of the “Tupperware party” is a gendered construct aimed at appeasing the general ethos of the domestic arrangements of the era where men were the sole earners and it was the women's responsibility to manage the housework. It was the Larkin company, however that were the forerunners of these types of "parties", during the 1890s, that were popularized by such organizations as Tupperware.[24]
Feminist views vary regarding the Tupperware format of sales through parties, and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the Tupperware model. Opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women, and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking.[23] The positive feminist views consider that Tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to the unequal gender laws in the workplace. The company promoted the betterment of women and the endless opportunities Tupperware offered to women; whereas, the negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career.[5] The emergence of Tupperware on the American market created a new kind of opportunity to an entirely underrepresented labor demographic; women, and especially suburban housewives, which subsequently facilitated the calls for equal rights between men and women in the workplace.[citation needed]

Company history[edit]




Tupperware containers from 2011


Tupperware was developed in 1946 by Earl Silas Tupper (1907–83) in Leominster, Massachusetts.[4] He developed plastic containers used in households to contain food and keep it airtight. The once-patented "burping seal" is a famous aspect of Tupperware, which distinguished it from competitors. Earl Tupper invented the plastic for Tupperware already in 1938, but the product only worked with the emergence of the sale through presentation in a party setting. In 1949, Tupperware introduced the 'Wonderlier Bowl' that gave a start to a revolutionary range of kitchen utensils.
Tupperware pioneered the direct marketing strategy made famous by the Tupperware party. The Tupperware Party allowed for women of the 1950s to work and enjoy the benefits of earning an income without completely taking away the independence granted to women during the Second World War when women first began entering the labor market, all the while keeping their focus in the domestic domain.[5] The "Party" model builds on characteristics generally developed by being a housewife (e.g., party planning, hosting a party, sociable relations with friends and neighbors) and created an alternative choice for women who either needed or wanted to work. Brownie Wise (1913–92) realized Tupperware's potential as a fun commodity. She realized, however, that she had to be creative and therefore started to throw these Tupperware parties. Wise, a former sales representative of Stanley Home Products, developed the strategy. Tupper was so impressed that Brownie Wise was made vice president of marketing in 1951. Wise soon created Tupperware Parties Inc.[6]
During the early 1950s, Tupperware's sales and popularity exploded, thanks in large part to Wise's influence among women who sold Tupperware, and some of the famous "jubilees" celebrating the success of Tupperware ladies at lavish and outlandishly themed parties. Tupperware was known—at a time when women came back from working during World War II only to be told to "go back to the kitchen"[7]—as a method of empowering women, and giving them a toehold in the postwar business world.[8][9][10]
The tradition of Tupperware's "Jubilee" style events continues to this day, with rallies being held in major cities to recognize and reward top-selling and top-recruiting individuals, teams, and organizations.
In 1958, Earl Tupper fired Wise over general difference of opinion in the Tupperware business operation. Officially, Tupper objected to the expenses incurred by the jubilee and other similar celebrations of Tupperware.[11] However, the real reason was that Tupper had been approached by several companies interested in buying him out; he felt that he would not be able to sell with a woman in an executive position.[12] Rexall bought Tupperware in 1958.
Tupperware spread to Europe in 1960 when Mila Pond hosted a Tupperware party in Weybridge, England, and subsequently around the world. At the time, a strict dress code was required for Tupperware ladies, with skirts and stockings (tights) worn at all times, and white gloves often accompanying the outfit.[13] A technique called "carrot calling" helped promote the parties: representatives would travel door to door in a neighborhood and ask housewives to "run an experiment" in which carrots would be placed in a Tupperware container and compared with "anything that you would ordinarily leave it in"; it would often result in the scheduling of a Tupperware party.[13]
Rexall sold its namesake drugstores in 1977, and renamed itself Dart Industries. Dart merged with Kraftco to form Dart & Kraft. The company demerged, with the former Dart assets named Premark International. Tupperware Brands was spun off from Premark in 1996; Premark was acquired by Illinois Tool Works three years later.[citation needed]
In 2003, Tupperware closed down operations in the UK and Ireland, citing customer dissatisfaction with their direct sales model.[14] There has been limited importer-distribution since then.[15] The company announced a formal relaunch in the UK in mid-2011,[16] and recruited UK staff, but in December the relaunch was cancelled.[17]
Tupperware is now sold in almost 100 countries, after peaking at more than a hundred after 1996.[18]
Tupperware parties[edit]




A Tupperware party in the 1950s







This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Tupperware is still sold mostly through a party plan, with rewards for hosts. A Tupperware party is run by a Tupperware "consultant" for a host who invites friends and neighbors into his or her home to see the product line. Tupperware hosts are rewarded with free products based on the level of sales made at their party. Parties also take place in workplaces, schools, and other community groups.
In most countries, Tupperware's sales force is organized in a tiered structure with consultants at the bottom, managers and star managers over them, and next various levels of directors, with Legacy Executive Directors at the top level. In recent years, Tupperware has done away with distributorships in the United States. This has allowed Tupperware more flexibility and generous commissions and rewards for their consultants. [citation needed]
In recent years, Tupperware in North America has moved to a new business model which includes more emphasis on direct marketing channels and eliminated its dependency on authorized distributorships. This transition included selling through Target stores in the U.S., and Superstores in Canada, with disappointing results. Tupperware states this hurt direct sales.[19] In countries with a strong focus on marketing through parties (such as Germany, Australia, and New Zealand), Tupperware's market share and profitability continue to decline.[citation needed]
In many countries, Tupperware products come with a lifetime guarantee. In the UK/Ireland the guarantee is 10 years.[20] The company is best known for its plastic bowls and storage containers. However, in recent years it has branched out into stainless steel cookware, fine cutlery, chef's knives, and other kitchen gadgets. After experiencing a slump in sales and public image in the mid-1990s, the company created several new product lines to attract a younger market.
In some countries including Belgium, Australia, Ireland and the U.S., Tupperware markets their parties and career opportunities through mall kiosks from time to time.
In China, Tupperware products are sold through franchised "entrepreneurial shopfronts", of which there were 1,900 in 2005, due to pyramid selling laws enacted in 1998.[21][22] The Chinese characters 特百惠 are used as the brand name, and translate as "hundred benefit".
Cultural and historical impact[edit]




Typical authentic Tupperware


Tupperware created a way for women to remain housewives while creating an independence from the home in a sociable atmosphere.[23]
The reciprocity that emerges at the “parties,” which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess, creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling. Studies show that the creation of the “Tupperware party” is a gendered construct aimed at appeasing the general ethos of the domestic arrangements of the era where men were the sole earners and it was the women's responsibility to manage the housework. It was the Larkin company, however that were the forerunners of these types of "parties", during the 1890s, that were popularized by such organizations as Tupperware.[24]
Feminist views vary regarding the Tupperware format of sales through parties, and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the Tupperware model. Opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women, and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking.[23] The positive feminist views consider that Tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to the unequal gender laws in the workplace. The company promoted the betterment of women and the endless opportunities Tupperware offered to women; whereas, the negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career.[5] The emergence of Tupperware on the American market created a new kind of opportunity to an entirely underrepresented labor demographic; women, and especially suburban housewives, which subsequently facilitated the calls for equal rights between men and women in the workplace.[citation needed]
Product lines[edit]




One of the Tupperware's Ultraplus line of products

However, in recent years it has branched out into stainless steel cookware, fine cutlery, chef's knives, and other kitchen gadgets. After experiencing a slump in sales and public image in the mid-1990s, the company created several new product lines to attract a younger market.
In some countries including Belgium, Australia, Ireland and the U.S., Tupperware markets their parties and career opportunities through mall kiosks from time to time.
In China, Tupperware products are sold through franchised "entrepreneurial shopfronts", of which there were 1,900 in 2005, due to pyramid selling laws enacted in 1998.[21][22] The Chinese characters 特百惠 are used as the brand name, and translate as "hundred benefit".
Cultural and historical impact[edit]




Typical authentic Tupperware


Tupperware created a way for women to remain housewives while creating an independence from the home in a sociable atmosphere.[23]
The reciprocity that emerges at the “parties,” which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess, creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling. Studies show that the creation of the “Tupperware party” is a gendered construct aimed at appeasing the general ethos of the domestic arrangements of the era where men were the sole earners and it was the women's responsibility to manage the housework. It was the Larkin company, however that were the forerunners of these types of "parties", during the 1890s, that were popularized by such organizations as Tupperware.[24]
Feminist views vary regarding the Tupperware format of sales through parties, and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the Tupperware model. Opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women, and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking.[23] The positive feminist views consider that Tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to the unequal gender laws in the workplace. The company promoted the betterment of women and the endless opportunities Tupperware offered to women; whereas, the negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career.[5] The emergence of Tupperware on the American market created a new kind of opportunity to an entirely underrepresented labor demographic; women, and especially suburban housewives, which subsequently facilitated the calls for equal rights between men and women in the workplace.[citation needed]

Company history[edit]




Tupperware containers from 2011


Tupperware was developed in 1946 by Earl Silas Tupper (1907–83) in Leominster, Massachusetts.[4] He developed plastic containers used in households to contain food and keep it airtight. The once-patented "burping seal" is a famous aspect of Tupperware, which distinguished it from competitors. Earl Tupper invented the plastic for Tupperware already in 1938, but the product only worked with the emergence of the sale through presentation in a party setting. In 1949, Tupperware introduced the 'Wonderlier Bowl' that gave a start to a revolutionary range of kitchen utensils.
Tupperware pioneered the direct marketing strategy made famous by the Tupperware party. The Tupperware Party allowed for women of the 1950s to work and enjoy the benefits of earning an income without completely taking away the independence granted to women during the Second World War when women first began entering the labor market, all the while keeping their focus in the domestic domain.[5] The "Party" model builds on characteristics generally developed by being a housewife (e.g., party planning, hosting a party, sociable relations with friends and neighbors) and created an alternative choice for women who either needed or wanted to work. Brownie Wise (1913–92) realized Tupperware's potential as a fun commodity. She realized, however, that she had to be creative and therefore started to throw these Tupperware parties. Wise, a former sales representative of Stanley Home Products, developed the strategy. Tupper was so impressed that Brownie Wise was made vice president of marketing in 1951. Wise soon created Tupperware Parties Inc.[6]
During the early 1950s, Tupperware's sales and popularity exploded, thanks in large part to Wise's influence among women who sold Tupperware, and some of the famous "jubilees" celebrating the success of Tupperware ladies at lavish and outlandishly themed parties. Tupperware was known—at a time when women came back from working during World War II only to be told to "go back to the kitchen"[7]—as a method of empowering women, and giving them a toehold in the postwar business world.[8][9][10]
The tradition of Tupperware's "Jubilee" style events continues to this day, with rallies being held in major cities to recognize and reward top-selling and top-recruiting individuals, teams, and organizations.
In 1958, Earl Tupper fired Wise over general difference of opinion in the Tupperware business operation. Officially, Tupper objected to the expenses incurred by the jubilee and other similar celebrations of Tupperware.[11] However, the real reason was that Tupper had been approached by several companies interested in buying him out; he felt that he would not be able to sell with a woman in an executive position.[12] Rexall bought Tupperware in 1958.
Tupperware spread to Europe in 1960 when Mila Pond hosted a Tupperware party in Weybridge, England, and subsequently around the world. At the time, a strict dress code was required for Tupperware ladies, with skirts and stockings (tights) worn at all times, and white gloves often accompanying the outfit.[13] A technique called "carrot calling" helped promote the parties: representatives would travel door to door in a neighborhood and ask housewives to "run an experiment" in which carrots would be placed in a Tupperware container and compared with "anything that you would ordinarily leave it in"; it would often result in the scheduling of a Tupperware party.[13]
Rexall sold its namesake drugstores in 1977, and renamed itself Dart Industries. Dart merged with Kraftco to form Dart & Kraft. The company demerged, with the former Dart assets named Premark International. Tupperware Brands was spun off from Premark in 1996; Premark was acquired by Illinois Tool Works three years later.[citation needed]
In 2003, Tupperware closed down operations in the UK and Ireland, citing customer dissatisfaction with their direct sales model.[14] There has been limited importer-distribution since then.[15] The company announced a formal relaunch in the UK in mid-2011,[16] and recruited UK staff, but in December the relaunch was cancelled.[17]
Tupperware is now sold in almost 100 countries, after peaking at more than a hundred after 1996.[18]
Tupperware parties[edit]




A Tupperware party in the 1950s







This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Tupperware is still sold mostly through a party plan, with rewards for hosts. A Tupperware party is run by a Tupperware "consultant" for a host who invites friends and neighbors into his or her home to see the product line. Tupperware hosts are rewarded with free products based on the level of sales made at their party. Parties also take place in workplaces, schools, and other community groups.
In most countries, Tupperware's sales force is organized in a tiered structure with consultants at the bottom, managers and star managers over them, and next various levels of directors, with Legacy Executive Directors at the top level. In recent years, Tupperware has done away with distributorships in the United States. This has allowed Tupperware more flexibility and generous commissions and rewards for their consultants. [citation needed]
In recent years, Tupperware in North America has moved to a new business model which includes more emphasis on direct marketing channels and eliminated its dependency on authorized distributorships. This transition included selling through Target stores in the U.S., and Superstores in Canada, with disappointing results. Tupperware states this hurt direct sales.[19] In countries with a strong focus on marketing through parties (such as Germany, Australia, and New Zealand), Tupperware's market share and profitability continue to decline.[citation needed]
In many countries, Tupperware products come with a lifetime guarantee. In the UK/Ireland the guarantee is 10 years.[20] The company is best known for its plastic bowls and storage containers. However, in recent years it has branched out into stainless steel cookware, fine cutlery, chef's knives, and other kitchen gadgets. After experiencing a slump in sales and public image in the mid-1990s, the company created several new product lines to attract a younger market.
In some countries including Belgium, Australia, Ireland and the U.S., Tupperware markets their parties and career opportunities through mall kiosks from time to time.
In China, Tupperware products are sold through franchised "entrepreneurial shopfronts", of which there were 1,900 in 2005, due to pyramid selling laws enacted in 1998.[21][22] The Chinese characters 特百惠 are used as the brand name, and translate as "hundred benefit".
Cultural and historical impact[edit]




Typical authentic Tupperware


Tupperware created a way for women to remain housewives while creating an independence from the home in a sociable atmosphere.[23]
The reciprocity that emerges at the “parties,” which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess, creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling. Studies show that the creation of the “Tupperware party” is a gendered construct aimed at appeasing the general ethos of the domestic arrangements of the era where men were the sole earners and it was the women's responsibility to manage the housework. It was the Larkin company, however that were the forerunners of these types of "parties", during the 1890s, that were popularized by such organizations as Tupperware.[24]
Feminist views vary regarding the Tupperware format of sales through parties, and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the Tupperware model. Opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women, and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking.[23] The positive feminist views consider that Tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to the unequal gender laws in the workplace. The company promoted the betterment of women and the endless opportunities Tupperware offered to women; whereas, the negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career.[5] The emergence of Tupperware on the American market created a new kind of opportunity to an entirely underrepresented labor demographic; women, and especially suburban housewives, which subsequently facilitated the calls for equal rights between men and women in the workplace.[citation needed]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
