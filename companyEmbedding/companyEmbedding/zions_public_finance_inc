 Twin Falls/Chobani Yogurt 





Project Summary â On February 21, 2013 the Urban Renewal Agency (URA) of the City of Twin Falls, Idaho issued $32,509,000 of Series 2013 A Tax Increment Bonds and the Local Improvement District (LID) of the City of Twin Falls, Idaho issued $32,509,000 of Series 2013 Special Assessment Bonds with a maturity of 20 years.  The bonds were issued as private placement taxable bonds with Zions Bank as the purchaser.  Bond proceeds financed water and wastewater expansion and land acquisition to support the construction of a new 1,000,000 square foot, $450 million Chobani Yogurt production facility, which is the largest yogurt plant in the world.  The new Chobani plant is scheduled to generate approximately $7.2 million in new property taxes that that will be used to repay the annual debt service of $2.7 million.  The Chobani project is one of the largest economic development projects in the history of the State of Idaho and has generated over 600 new jobs in addition to supporting one of the largest dairy economies in the Unites States with over 450,000 dairy cows.
Unique Bond Structure â A traditional tax increment bond pledges only the incremental property taxes generated from new improvements in a designated urban renewal area. The fact that 1) Chobani is the only property that generates incremental property taxes to repay the bonds, 2) the first property taxes will not be collected on the Chobani improvements until 2014 and 3) there is no historic tax collection record created a credit problem for this financing.  To solve this problem, the City of Twin Falls created a LID with boundaries that only surrounded the new Chobani improvements.  The LID issued Special Assessment Bonds with the same par amount and repayment schedule as the Tax Increment Bonds.  This created the double pledge of the tax increment (URA Tax Increment Bonds) and a first lien on the $450 million of Chobani improvements (LID Special Assessment Bonds). Proceeds of $32,509,000 were funded only from the URA tax increment bond and no cash proceeds were funded from the LID special assessment bond. Even though the LID bonds did not deliver proceeds, they had to be issued to pledge the security. When the annual URA tax increment bond payment is made then the annual LID assessment bond payment is credited from the tax increment payment and no special assessment is levied.  However, if the tax increment that is collected is insufficient to fully repay the URA bond payment then the LID would levy a special assessment against Chobani to pay the difference. If Chobani did not pay the special assessment bond payment then their property would be foreclosed and the bond holder would have first access to proceeds from the sale of the $450 million facility to repay the $32,509,000 of bonds, creating over 13 X’s coverage. Additionally, Chobani agreed to provide a guaranty that it would pay for any shortfall in the tax increment payment. 
Collateral - Four sources of collateral exist for the Twin Falls Chobani financing:  1) tax increment revenues, 2) guaranty from Chobani to offset any deficiency in tax increment revenues3) special assessments against the Chobani property and 4) first lien on the $450 million yogurt facility.  All parties involved benefitted from this financing structure. Chobani knows that all it has to do is pay its property taxes and it will not have to provide the guaranty or pay the special assessment payment. Chobani’s creditors were okay with the first lien on the property because the assessment was viewed as a tax. The purchaser of the bonds, Zions Bank, knew that it had over two times coverage from tax increment and 13 times coverage from the assessment bonds.  Twin Falls received a huge economic boost without having to pledge any additional city resources. However, the financing had previously failed when structured solely as a traditional tax increment bond due to the concentrated risk in one tax payer and the lack of tax increment collection.  The “belt and suspenders” approach from the combined tax increment and special assessment bond was likely the only structure that would have allowed the bond financing to get completed. Twin Falls issued additional $2,024,000 of Series B tax increment bonds for improvements that could not be offset by the special assessment bonds as well.

Public Finance Offices


ZB, N.A.






The roots of Zions Public Finance run back into the 1800s. Edward L. Burton and his family were among the first investment bankers in the intermountain region. They operated as Edward L. Burton & Company from 1899 to 1954. In 1924, J. Alma (Al) Burrows joined the firm. Nicholas G. Smith joined the firm in 1954, and the firm subsequently changed its name to Burrows,Smith & Company. In 1981, Burrows, Smith & Company was sold to Prudential-Bache Securities.
When Prudential-Bache determined to leave the world of public finance in 1988, the Pru-Bache Utah team decided to create their own firm called Smith Capital Markets Inc. and continued serving the intermountain market. In 1989, Smith Capital Markets was acquired by Zions First National Bank which merged these professionals with its own staff of public finance bankers who had been engaged in public finance since 1974.
Zions Bank has been in Salt Lake City since 1873. In 1974, Zions asked Jim Fenton to open its own public finance operation in the intermountain west. Mr. Fenton had also worked for Edward L. Burton & Company as an investment banker and he quickly assembled a small team of public finance professionals who served the municipal market from 1974 until the merger with Smith Capital Markets in 1989.
Zions operated its public finance business under the name Smith Captial Markets until 1993 when the bank acquired Discount Corporation of New York. We operated under the name of Discount Corporation until 1994 when we changed our name to Zions Public Finance. The rest is history.
Zions Bank is registered as a Municipal Securities Dealer and a Municipal Advisor.

	all general partners and each limited and special partner that has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 25% or more of the partnership's capital;






	(c)

	in the case of a direct owner listed on Schedule A-1 that is a trust
