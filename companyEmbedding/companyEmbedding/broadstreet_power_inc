Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Broadstreet Solar Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Broadstreet Solar Inc currently holds license 1009672 (General Building Contractor, Electrical), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Broadstreet Solar Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Broadstreet Solar Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Broadstreet Solar Inc has a $12,500 bond with Suretec Indemnity Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Broadstreet Solar Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.

        Best buy, more than expected
Just put this desk together today. It the first time I see a manual/instruction with all the parts marked with each steps. This makes installation a lot easier. The desk looks great, is well made and very sturdy. I am completely satisfied now and hope will be the same for years to come.

        A great option!
I purchased this set late last year for my single commercial office. My office is about 350 sq ft or less and it does take up quite a bit of space, but in a good way. My clients have enough space to sit in front and more importantly, I have enough space to work!

The quality of this material was much better than expected! I did get this set on sale, but this is a really professional desk! I love the additional file cabinet! I am considering expanding my office and while I will look around at other choices, this will be on the top of my list! Especially if it comes on sale again!

        Love it!
I bought this desk for a home office. I was looking at an L-shaped desk that I was going to buy, but then I saw this U-shaped one. I was worried that it would be too big for the room so I took the measurements for it and it was the size of a queen size bed. I ordered it online because it was on sale and then received an extra 5% off for picking it up. My husband put it together in 7 hours. We bought the hutch to go with it. It is well worth the time, the effort, and the price! I absolutely love it. It is a beautiful piece of furniture. I love all the space I have for my printer, laptop and other office supplies. It is very sturdy and looks more expensive than what it was. I would definitely recommend this product!
