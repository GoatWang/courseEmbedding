COVINGTON, Ky. - Ashland Inc. (NYSE: ASH) today announced that Janice J. Teal, Ph.D., former group vice president and chief scientific officer for Avon Products Inc., has been elected to the company's board of directors. With her election, the Ashland board now has 11 directors. 
Dr. Teal, 59, brings 28 years of leadership and scientific research experience to Ashland's board. Prior to her retirement from Avon in 2010, she led the company's global research and development team of chemists and scientists, with responsibility for the development and support of Avon's worldwide product lines. Before that, Dr. Teal served as vice president of the Avon Skin Care Laboratories, where she led the bioscience research and skin care teams that ultimately led to the growth of the Anew Skin Care brand to over $1 billion in sales. She had additional responsibility for development of Avon's vitamin and nutritional lines. Dr. Teal joined Avon in 1982 as a program leader in toxicology and built Avon's first pharmacokinetics and cell culture laboratories. She earned a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Emory University and served as a Research Fellow in toxicology at New York University.
