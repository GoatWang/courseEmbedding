Sales management system

Are you getting the most out of your sales contacts or do you feel they could be used better? A sales management system will help you track leads, manage your sales contacts effectively, and monitor the progress of your deals with ease.
What is a sales management system and why do I need it?
A sales management system is a tool that helps salespeople get organized, manage their contacts better, track their sales deals more efficiently and save them time. In short - a tool that helps salespeople sell more. A sales CRM should also give sales managers a simple yet clear overview of how their team is performing - a tool that helps their team sell better. So whether you’re a small-business owner, a salesperson or a sales manager, a good sales management software will help you drive your sales and reduce headaches.
What makes a sales management system good?
There are plenty of things you need to look out for when shopping for a sales CRM. Above all, you need to make sure that the CRM you’re going to choose suits your needs. The aspects that need to be included in a good sales CRM, according to our more than 40 000 users:
Easy to use
Simple to learn, intuitive
Customizable
Notifies you when to take action
Mobile – accessible everywhere.
Good sales reporting
Cross-platform integrations
Good looking, visual


The problem with "once-a-week CRMs"
To get the most out of a sales management system, people need to want to use it – it needs to be helpful in day-to-day business. Far too often CRMs end up being these tedious and tiresome points of data entry on the final day of the week. The problem here? People forget – they forget deals, contacts and deadlines, which makes the “once-a-week CRM” basically useless.
Eye candy, aka why good looks and ease of use make a difference
A good sales management software is visually appealing and gives the user a comprehensive view of the situation. It’s simple to use, as if customization were a religion and drag-and-drop its holy script. Think about it, every businesses are different, but most people generally like simplicity.
A sales management system that can boost your sales
Pipedrive is a webCRM that gets salespeople and business owners organized. Using the sales pipeline view, you will always know which deals you need to concentrate on and which contacts you need to be emailing, calling or meeting. Nearly everything in Pipedrive is customizable, and it integrates with all the tools you need for running your business. The native mobile apps let you take the CRM software everywhere you go, and ensure you never miss an opportunity.

We've used multiple CRMs to manage tens of thousands of rental homeowner contacts for rented.cm, but Pipedrive still has our favorite visuals for deal pipeline and conversion rates throughout the funnel. If you are looking for an easy, intuitive, CRM for your company, try Pipedrive.

Pipedrive is a sales tool for small teams with big ambitions


We’ve built a CRM tool that’s great not only for salespeople, but also anyone wanting to get super organized and close deals in less time.
About half of our customers liked us so much they switched from their existing CRM; the other half didn’t even know they needed Pipedrive until they tried it.

Frequently asked questions



					What's the difference between the Silver, Gold and Platinum plans?
The Gold plan gives you the ability to send and read emails without leaving Pipedrive. With the Gold plan, you will have deal notes and the full conversation history available to you as you write emails as well as have the responses automatically connected back to your deal. With the Silver plan, you continue to use your existing email provider and will need to BCC Pipedrive to connect emails with deals. The Platinum plan gives you all the benefits of the Gold plan plus live phone support and a dedicated private environment for your sales data. It is designed for people who have truly unique requirements for sales management.

					Can I trial the Gold plan?
Yes, you can trial the Gold plan by entering your credit card details after you have started a Silver trial. Your credit card will not be charged during the trial period.

					Can I have more than one seat during a trial?
Yes, you can invite team members to join your Pipedrive trial. Simply go to the “Settings” screen under your profile drop-down on the upper right corner, then select “Users & Permissions” to add additional people to your trial.

					Are there any limits to upgrading and downgrading between plans?
Users can easily upgrade and downgrade between plans. When downgrading, excess funds will remain as credit. Switching between plans can be done at any time in the billing cycle.

Pipeline management





Gain total visibility into your pipeline
						We’ve built our software around a proven sales pipeline management methodology. The primary view is the pipeline, a clear visual interface that prompts you to take action, remain organized and stay in control of a complex sales process. This is why sales pros and deal makers love it (their words, not ours).
					



Gives you clarity where you need it most


Is fully customizable on all levels


Lets you easily find the stats you need


Is easy and intuitive to use


Has no silly restrictions

Feature introduction video










Clarity where it is needed most





In the pipeline view, deals are categorized by sales stage. This feature allows your team to develop a clear understanding of your sales momentum and priorities, and refocus efforts accordingly.













Fully customizable at all levels





Your pipeline is fully customizable to fit your unique sales process. Add as many sales stages, team members or activity types as you need. Give each stage an appropriate name and start completing actions. If there are features you feel you don’t need right now, you can turn them off and on as you wish.













Easily find the stats you’re looking for

The statistics tool is perfect for quickly getting to the heart of questions you ask every day. It  shows you the health of your pipeline, and which stages need improvement. Apply relevant filters to access in-depth and personalized analysis of your sales pipeline, delivered in seconds.









Easy to use, intuitive and always available





Adding deals, contacts or activities to your pipeline is smooth with our intuitive drag-and-drop interface and foolproof menus. The visual layout of Pipedrive ensures salespeople have the visibility they need at all times, and in all places.













No restrictions

Although it remains our key focus, Pipedrive is definitely not only used by salespeople. We have clients who use it to manage workflow, enrollment, complicated projects, rewards programs and much more.

See the number of new deals added, average age of deals, number of open deals and stage-to-stage conversion for all of your deals in any time period. Applying custom filters to any report ensures you see the data you need.

 Common QuestionsHow is Credit Score calculated?Credit score is calculated using three main values. The calculation first looks at information on your account and profile (your existing credit, outstanding loans, overdrafts), it then checks public records for any black marks on you such as bankruptcies or summons. The third factor is inquiries, both on your part of applying for loans and credits, and of lenders inquiring as to your credit score. Modern credit scores are also now calculated taking into account the credit score of everybody else, to place you in a percentile which can influence your approval and interest rate.Do too many inquiries still negatively affect my Credit Score?It is often cited that having too many credit inquiries on your credit history can contribute to a low credit score. Whilst this is true in the long run and applying for a credit on a number of occasions over a long period of time can detrimentally affect your score, a number of inquiries in a short space of time when shopping for the best interest rates is often recognized by credit scorers and not taken into consideration as ‘over-inquiring.’What is considered a good/bad Credit Score?Credit scores are calculated differently depending upon the agency carrying out the assessment. Across all of the main reporting bodies (Equifax, VantageScore, TransUnion, FICO, Experian), the higher the score; the lower the credit risk. A low credit score will affect the consumer’s chances of being approved for credit and receiving low interest rates. It is impossible to categorize a general ‘good’ or ‘bad’ score as it will depend upon the body calculating the score, however receiving a favorable score from one body will normally mean that your credit score is good across all calculations.

  Understanding Credit ReportsThe availability of credit is going to make it easier for you to make purchases, and it is useful to have a source of extra cash in the case of an emergency. It is difficult to survive in the modern world without at least some type of credit – some experts are even predicting that paper money is going to soon become obsolete. This dependence on credit also creates a number of disadvantages, and this is why it can be so important to use services such as credit monitoring. What is Credit Monitoring?Credit monitoring basically means that you are paying attention to your current situation in regards to available credit. The easiest way to do this is to just carefully read any statements you are sent from the companies providing you with a deferred payment service. This traditional way of monitoring your credit score and information isn’t ideal because these statements usually only arrive once a month, and they are always going to be out-of-date (i.e. if you used credit in the last few days, it is unlikely to show up on your statement).The benefit of a credit monitoring service is that it allows you to keep a much closer eye on what is happening with your credit. If there are mistakes or any suspicious behavior related to your account, you can pick it up right away. It also allows you to keep an eye on your credit score – this can be particularly important if you own a business. This type of service is usually offered on a subscription basis – it means that the provider of the service will monitor your credit activity and alert you right away if there is anything unusual happening. Why is Credit Monitoring Important?One of the most common reasons for choosing credit monitoring is to reduce the likelihood of identity theft. The fact that so many of us rely on credit these days means that this can be a particular profitable crime – it also involves relatively little risk. If somebody can pretend to be you, it means they can use your credit. You could find yourself facing a ton of debt along with the handicap of a poor credit score. Identity theft means that you have been the victim of a crime, but it can be very hard to prove this. The benefit of credit monitoring is you can spot any suspicious behavior almost right away and deal with it.An additional benefit of finding the best credit monitoring agency that suits your needs it that they offer services that allow you to track and monitor your credit score. This is useful information because it indicates how easy it is going to be for you to borrow money in the future – if you know you have a bad credit score, you can take action to improve it. Business owners can use credit report monitoring to find out about anyone who is making inquiries about their financial situation.One of the other benefits of a credit monitoring service is that it can provide very detailed information about your financial situation. You can expect to have access to comprehensive reports that provide a clear overview of your different lines of credit – there may be graphs that clearly show how your credit is distributed. You can also easily look back on your payment history to check for any mistakes or just for reference purposes. This information can also be useful because it can allow you to assess if you could save money by moving your credit around. How to Find the Best Credit Reports ServiceThe type of information and service you are going to get with credit monitoring can vary a great deal. Some credit reports agencies cater mostly for businesses, and they provide very comprehensive reports. In order to find the best credit report company for you, it is important to first consider your needs – it’s not really worth paying extra for services you are never going to use.One of the other things to consider when choosing a credit monitoring service is the number of credit reports it tracks. If you are looking for this type of service in the US, you want a company that is able to conduct 3 bureau credit monitoring. You also want to have these reports tracked on a daily basis.It is important that you are able to protect your lines of credit, so you can continue to benefit from this service in the future and not end up a victim of identity theft. Credit monitoring is a way for you to do this effectively.Knowledge is power and it's never too late to learn. Read our credit report monitoring service reviews and make a decision as to which credit monitoring service is best for you.  Copyright © 2009-2017 Natural Intelligence Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

Sales management system

Are you getting the most out of your sales contacts or do you feel they could be used better? A sales management system will help you track leads, manage your sales contacts effectively, and monitor the progress of your deals with ease.
What is a sales management system and why do I need it?
A sales management system is a tool that helps salespeople get organized, manage their contacts better, track their sales deals more efficiently and save them time. In short - a tool that helps salespeople sell more. A sales CRM should also give sales managers a simple yet clear overview of how their team is performing - a tool that helps their team sell better. So whether you’re a small-business owner, a salesperson or a sales manager, a good sales management software will help you drive your sales and reduce headaches.
What makes a sales management system good?
There are plenty of things you need to look out for when shopping for a sales CRM. Above all, you need to make sure that the CRM you’re going to choose suits your needs. The aspects that need to be included in a good sales CRM, according to our more than 40 000 users:
Easy to use
Simple to learn, intuitive
Customizable
Notifies you when to take action
Mobile – accessible everywhere.
Good sales reporting
Cross-platform integrations
Good looking, visual


The problem with "once-a-week CRMs"
To get the most out of a sales management system, people need to want to use it – it needs to be helpful in day-to-day business. Far too often CRMs end up being these tedious and tiresome points of data entry on the final day of the week. The problem here? People forget – they forget deals, contacts and deadlines, which makes the “once-a-week CRM” basically useless.
Eye candy, aka why good looks and ease of use make a difference
A good sales management software is visually appealing and gives the user a comprehensive view of the situation. It’s simple to use, as if customization were a religion and drag-and-drop its holy script. Think about it, every businesses are different, but most people generally like simplicity.
A sales management system that can boost your sales
Pipedrive is a webCRM that gets salespeople and business owners organized. Using the sales pipeline view, you will always know which deals you need to concentrate on and which contacts you need to be emailing, calling or meeting. Nearly everything in Pipedrive is customizable, and it integrates with all the tools you need for running your business. The native mobile apps let you take the CRM software everywhere you go, and ensure you never miss an opportunity.

We've used multiple CRMs to manage tens of thousands of rental homeowner contacts for rented.cm, but Pipedrive still has our favorite visuals for deal pipeline and conversion rates throughout the funnel. If you are looking for an easy, intuitive, CRM for your company, try Pipedrive.

Pipedrive is a sales tool for small teams with big ambitions


We’ve built a CRM tool that’s great not only for salespeople, but also anyone wanting to get super organized and close deals in less time.
About half of our customers liked us so much they switched from their existing CRM; the other half didn’t even know they needed Pipedrive until they tried it.

Love this program. It is the only CRM that I actually want to use. Having a CRM that you don't want to use leads to your team not using it. What's the point of that. Pipedrive is built by sales people, for sales people.

Frequently asked questions



					What's the difference between the Silver, Gold and Platinum plans?
The Gold plan gives you the ability to send and read emails without leaving Pipedrive. With the Gold plan, you will have deal notes and the full conversation history available to you as you write emails as well as have the responses automatically connected back to your deal. With the Silver plan, you continue to use your existing email provider and will need to BCC Pipedrive to connect emails with deals. The Platinum plan gives you all the benefits of the Gold plan plus live phone support and a dedicated private environment for your sales data. It is designed for people who have truly unique requirements for sales management.

					Can I trial the Gold plan?
Yes, you can trial the Gold plan by entering your credit card details after you have started a Silver trial. Your credit card will not be charged during the trial period.

					Can I have more than one seat during a trial?
Yes, you can invite team members to join your Pipedrive trial. Simply go to the “Settings” screen under your profile drop-down on the upper right corner, then select “Users & Permissions” to add additional people to your trial.

					Are there any limits to upgrading and downgrading between plans?
Users can easily upgrade and downgrade between plans. When downgrading, excess funds will remain as credit. Switching between plans can be done at any time in the billing cycle.







More than 50 seats?

Clarity where it is needed most
In the pipeline view, deals are categorized by sales stage. This feature allows your team to develop a clear understanding of your sales momentum and priorities, and refocus efforts accordingly.








Easily find the stats you’re looking for
The statistics tool is perfect for quickly getting to the heart of questions you ask every day. It  shows you the health of your pipeline, and which stages need improvement. Apply relevant filters to access in-depth and personalized analysis of your sales pipeline, delivered in seconds.













Fully customizable at all levels
Your pipeline is fully customizable to fit your unique sales process. Add as many sales stages, team members or activity types as you need. Give each stage an appropriate name and start completing actions. If there are features you feel you don’t need right now, you can turn them off and on as you wish.








No restrictions
Although it remains our key focus, Pipedrive is definitely not only used by salespeople. We have clients who use it to manage workflow, enrollment, complicated projects, rewards programs and much more.













Easy to use, intuitive and always available
Adding deals, contacts or activities to your pipeline is smooth with our intuitive drag-and-drop interface and foolproof menus. The visual layout of Pipedrive ensures salespeople have the visibility they need at all times, and in all places.

Sales reporting





Simple but effective sales reporting
						Understand the reasoning behind your data and results. Why is one team member about to break a sales record while another can’t get a deal past the second stage of the pipeline? Are you on course to hit your yearly target, or do you need to make a drastic correction to your sales process? Our reporting reveals it all.
					



Gives you great visual reports


Lets you track and test your sales process

Track and test your sales process





Now that you can easily access your data, use it to set effective goals that will help push deals through the pipeline. At each stage of your sales cycle, you will be able to see your accomplishments and shortcomings in real time, and all incomplete goals are automatically carried over to the next period.













Understand pipeline metrics with customizable reports





See the number of new deals added, average age of deals, number of open deals and stage-to-stage conversion for all of your deals in any time period. Applying custom filters to any report ensures you see the data you need.













See sales split by product





If you sell multiple products or services, you can see key sales stats split by your products or services. Some examples include: sales volume and value, average discount and time in pipeline.
