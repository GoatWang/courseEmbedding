Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Large Scale Event Management.






Are Greenwood Hall's solutions available individually?



Greenwood Hall strives to remain flexible to best serve the unique needs of each of its institutional partners.  While our services are available as an entire suite, they are also available standalone- addressing the specific needs of our clients.





What is co-sourcing vs. outsourcing?



Unlike outsourcing, a co-sourcing arrangement involves equal collaboration between the employees of an institution and those of an outside partner. Collaboration from professionals within both parties is necessary to create the desired result – generation of new revenue sources for an institution or efficiencies that enable an institution’s employees to be more successful in their roles.
Co-sourcing also has other benefits. It can bring otherwise expensive technologies and expertise to an institution and its workforce without the school being required to surrender control. Furthermore, co-sourcing works in tandem with an institution’s processes and culture. In essence, an organization gains all the benefits of outsourcing without having to make the hard sacrifices of control or reduction in workforce.





What does Greenwood Hall mean by "Large Scale Event" Management? 



Large scale event management includes the coordination, launching, and support of telethons, major campaigns, and fundraisers.  Greenwood Hall will support you from early planning stages, through successful conclusion and continued donor follow up. We will customize the appropriate solution to benefit your cause, allowing flawless execution while maximizing donor contributions. Past large scale events include Stand Up to Cancer, Hope for Haiti Now, and Shelter from the Storm (post Hurricane Katrina event).





How is Greenwood Hall different than a Call Center?



Greenwood Hall certainly has renowned call center capabilities and technologies – the same platform being leveraged by the American Red Cross, Stand Up to Cancer, Help for Haiti Now, and other leading non-profits.  Greenwood Hall utilizes its extensive education experience and expertise to deliver a number of education-specific, customized co-sourced solutions on that same reliable, expansive platform.





How do you scale up for overflow, peak periods and special events?



Greenwood Hall maintains call centers in Santa Ana, CA and Bryan, TX, employing over 200 representatives on average and more during peak periods.  When needed, we can quickly hire and train new representatives, reallocate existing resources or leverage strategic relationships with call centers nationwide to create an integrated call center network of 16,000 + agents.





How does Greenwood Hall represent our institution's brand?



Greenwood Hall is much more than an outsourcing partner; we truly become an extension of the Universities we serve.  Greenwood Hall achieves this level of relationship through true immersion with your institution.
Greenwood Hall begins by learning the unique institutional differentiators including mission, culture, and goals of each of our university partners and their programs.  Our personnel are trained on your campus by your leaders.  The result is unrivaled service delivery to your current and prospective students, through the voice of your institution.





How will Greenwood Hall represent our Cause or Brand? 



Greenwood Hall has extensive experience supporting leading non-profits, including the American Red Cross, Stand Up to Cancer, and others.  Our agents are trained by your team, to better understand your goals, your cause, and the needs of those that benefit from it.





What is Greenwood Hall's experience with Non-Profits? 



Greenwood Hall is recognized as the premier partner to leading non-profits.  Our experience and existing technology infrastructure allow us to rapidly scale to support the needs of your cause.  In many cases, our event coordination can help launch major campaigns and telethons within a week to 10 days.  Present and former clients include Habitat for Humanity, Stand Up to Cancer, the American Red Cross, Help for Haiti Now, The World War II Memorial Dedication and others.





What is the background of Greenwood Hall's counselors?



Most of our counselors have a bachelor’s if not a master’s degree.  Moreover, many of our counselors are hired with a background in the specific programs your institution is looking to launch, develop, or improve.  By providing program and institutional-relevant expertise, we provide unrivaled service delivery to your current and prospective students.





How does Greenwood Hall address compliance?



Greenwood Hall complies with relevant state and federal regulations as they pertain to privacy including but not limited to:  the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA); CAN-SPAM Act; Safe Harbor Regulations; Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); Gramm Leach Billey Act; the Federal Do Not Call Registry (DNC); Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR); and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Greenwood Hall is also PCI compliant and adheres to generally accepted security standards as they relate to payment processing, storage of financial information, and the safeguarding of proprietary information.





How does Greenwood Hall structure pricing?



Greenwood Hall strives to understand each institution’s financial situation and needs, and is flexible in offering the most appropriate pricing model for that institution, while optimizing the school’s Return on Investment and minimizing any mandated contract lengths.
