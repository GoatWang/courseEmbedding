Modification of Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting amended terms on this Website. Your continued use after such notice indicates your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. You should check this Privacy Policy periodically for modifications by referencing the Effective Date posted above.
Privacy Statement. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (“PAC”) operates this Website. All references to “we”, “our” “us” and similar terms shall refer to PAC. We regard the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the services that we offer to our Website users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Registration Data. We reserve the right to require you to register to receive certain benefits, products or services and to provide certain registration data including your name, country, zip code or postal code (as appropriate) and email address (“Registration Data”).
Personally Identifiable Data. Personally identifiable information is any information that concerns you individually or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). For example, the Registration Data includes Personally Identifiable Information as does any other information you submit that identifies you individually. We will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any Personally Identifiable Information about you, do not voluntarily submit such information to us. You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit or browse our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit or view all sections of our Website. If you become a registered user and make postings on the Website, we may collect information about your postings. This information may include, without limitation, areas of our Website on which you post, the content of your post, posts that are responded to, and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate. You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Website, via telephone, in writing, or though any other means. We collect all information in these communications, and because such information may be Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Automatic Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit or browse our Website, or become a registered user of our Website, we may also collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include certain anonymous information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access our Website, the pages you access while on our Website, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us to understand the characteristics of people who visit our Website and to improve and market our Website in general. In the event that we link any Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat such information as Personally Identifiable Information and only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information We Use. We may use the Personally Identifiable Information collected through our Website primarily for such purposes as:

helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
processing postings and sending related communications;
providing services and support to users;
improving our Website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
responding to users’ questions, inquiries, comments and instructions;
maintaining the security and integrity of our systems; and
fulfilling your orders.

In general, we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Website and to improve our Website.
If you become a registered member of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. If you decide to “opt-in,” we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about online products, related information and news items that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you decide you no longer want to receive these communications from us, we will provide you with an option to “opt-out” and change your preferences.
We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website and online products, such as hosting and maintaining our message boards or chat rooms and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services or processing payments and making deliveries. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on any of these sites before signing up with and using them.
Security. Information collected by this Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our employees are required by us to maintain and uphold your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (including credit card information), transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.
Transfer of Your Information. As we continue to develop our activities, we might acquire or buy other entities or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our entity or assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
Minors. This Website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 18 or the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside. We will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts or memberships for, any child that we knows to be under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 18. If we nevertheless discover that we have received Personally Identifiable Information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or that we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian may request that the child’s information be corrected or deleted from our files by contacting our Privacy Coordinator at the telephone number or address set out below.
Contact Us/Review Your Information/Opt-Out. If you have submitted personally identifiable information through this Website, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at the address indicated below. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law. You may also contact us through either of the above methods to request or review the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. Our contact information is as follows:info@pacapts.com

Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: Our business and investment strategy; our projected operating results; availability of qualified personnel; local and national market conditions and trends in our industry; demand for and lease-up of apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, and other economic conditions; availability of debt and/or equity financing and availability on favorable terms; changes in our asset values; our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future; and economic trends and economic recoveries.
Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties appear in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” PAC does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its projected operating results. PAC may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community, the format and extent of which may be different from the format and extent of the information contained at this Website.

With current operations in over 20 nationwide markets, PAC affiliated entities include a full service investment management firm, a full service acquisition, asset management and disposition firm, as well as our core business, a full service property level management firm. Collectively our management service firms oversee operations of over 31,000 multi-family units. As a group, all of these organizations combine to provide the full range of services necessary to fulfill and manage the investment interests of our owners and investment partners and to provide a superior level of service to our residents.
Our guiding management philosophy is to provide our residents with an exceptional living experience by offering quality apartment homes, superior resident services and total customer satisfaction. Our team achieves this through an ownership attitude that is cultivated throughout our culture and encouraged at every associate level. We hire the best associates in the business and make sure they have every tool they need to do an outstanding job…and then we entrust them to always do the right thing in taking care of our customers, our assets, and our business.
Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed primarily to acquire and operate multifamily properties in select targeted markets throughout the United States.

As a secondary strategy, we may acquire or originate senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in multifamily properties, membership or partnership interests in multifamily properties and other multifamily related assets and invest a lesser portion of our assets in other real estate related investments, including other income producing property types, senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in other income producing property types, membership or partnership interests in other income producing property types as determined by our manager as appropriate for us.

We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website.

We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants.

We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.
By accessing or otherwise using this website (the “Website”) you agree to be bound contractually by this Privacy Policy.
Effective Date: March 24, 2011
Modification of Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting amended terms on this Website.

Privacy Statement. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (“PAC”) operates this Website. All references to “we”, “our” “us” and similar terms shall refer to PAC. We regard the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the services that we offer to our Website users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Registration Data. We reserve the right to require you to register to receive certain benefits, products or services and to provide certain registration data including your name, country, zip code or postal code (as appropriate) and email address (“Registration Data”).
Personally Identifiable Data. Personally identifiable information is any information that concerns you individually or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). For example, the Registration Data includes Personally Identifiable Information as does any other information you submit that identifies you individually. We will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any Personally Identifiable Information about you, do not voluntarily submit such information to us. You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit or browse our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit or view all sections of our Website. If you become a registered user and make postings on the Website, we may collect information about your postings. This information may include, without limitation, areas of our Website on which you post, the content of your post, posts that are responded to, and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate. You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Website, via telephone, in writing, or though any other means. We collect all information in these communications, and because such information may be Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Automatic Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit or browse our Website, or become a registered user of our Website, we may also collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include certain anonymous information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access our Website, the pages you access while on our Website, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us to understand the characteristics of people who visit our Website and to improve and market our Website in general. In the event that we link any Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat such information as Personally Identifiable Information and only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
processing postings and sending related communications;
providing services and support to users;
improving our Website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
responding to users’ questions, inquiries, comments and instructions;

fulfilling your orders.

In general, we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Website and to improve our Website.
If you become a registered member of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. If you decide to “opt-in,” we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about online products, related information and news items that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you decide you no longer want to receive these communications from us, we will provide you with an option to “opt-out” and change your preferences.
We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website and online products, such as hosting and maintaining our message boards or chat rooms and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services or processing payments and making deliveries. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on any of these sites before signing up with and using them.
Security. Information collected by this Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our employees are required by us to maintain and uphold your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (including credit card information), transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.
Transfer of Your Information. As we continue to develop our activities, we might acquire or buy other entities or assets.

PAC also recognizes that if our residents or their guests have disabilities, they may have particular needs. PAC will work with our residents to identify things that can be done to make our apartment homes and the amenity areas more accessible or useable by our residents or their guests with disabilities.
If you or your guest have a disability and you think that an accommodation or modification might enhance access to or enjoyment of your apartment or your PAC community, you may request it any time during your residency.

Information Available on This Website
PAC may make financial and other information available through this Website. In some cases, the information may be audited. In most cases it will not have been audited. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “intends,” “believes,” “outlook” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. The information in this Website also may attempt to predict trends. Predictions obviously may or may not prove to be accurate. PAC considers portions of this Website to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: Our business and investment strategy; our projected operating results; availability of qualified personnel; local and national market conditions and trends in our industry; demand for and lease-up of apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, and other economic conditions; availability of debt and/or equity financing and availability on favorable terms; changes in our asset values; our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future; and economic trends and economic recoveries.
Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties appear in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” PAC does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its projected operating results. PAC may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community, the format and extent of which may be different from the format and extent of the information contained at this Website.
PAC also may make employment information available through this Website. PAC is an equal opportunity employer. PAC provides equal employment opportunity to qualified persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, veteran status, disability or other protected status. PAC’s policy relates to all phases of employment including recruitment, placement, promotion, training, demotion, transfer, layoff, recall and termination, rates of pay, employee benefits, and participation in all company-sponsored employee activities.

Privacy Policy
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.
By accessing or otherwise using this website (the “Website”) you agree to be bound contractually by this Privacy Policy.
Effective Date: March 24, 2011
Modification of Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting amended terms on this Website. Your continued use after such notice indicates your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. You should check this Privacy Policy periodically for modifications by referencing the Effective Date posted above.
Privacy Statement. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (“PAC”) operates this Website. All references to “we”, “our” “us” and similar terms shall refer to PAC. We regard the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the services that we offer to our Website users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Registration Data. We reserve the right to require you to register to receive certain benefits, products or services and to provide certain registration data including your name, country, zip code or postal code (as appropriate) and email address (“Registration Data”).
Personally Identifiable Data. Personally identifiable information is any information that concerns you individually or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). For example, the Registration Data includes Personally Identifiable Information as does any other information you submit that identifies you individually. We will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any Personally Identifiable Information about you, do not voluntarily submit such information to us. You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit or browse our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit or view all sections of our Website. If you become a registered user and make postings on the Website, we may collect information about your postings. This information may include, without limitation, areas of our Website on which you post, the content of your post, posts that are responded to, and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate. You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Website, via telephone, in writing, or though any other means. We collect all information in these communications, and because such information may be Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Automatic Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit or browse our Website, or become a registered user of our Website, we may also collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include certain anonymous information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access our Website, the pages you access while on our Website, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us to understand the characteristics of people who visit our Website and to improve and market our Website in general. In the event that we link any Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat such information as Personally Identifiable Information and only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information We Use. We may use the Personally Identifiable Information collected through our Website primarily for such purposes as:

helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
processing postings and sending related communications;
providing services and support to users;
improving our Website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
responding to users’ questions, inquiries, comments and instructions;
maintaining the security and integrity of our systems; and
fulfilling your orders.

In general, we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Website and to improve our Website.
If you become a registered member of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. If you decide to “opt-in,” we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about online products, related information and news items that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you decide you no longer want to receive these communications from us, we will provide you with an option to “opt-out” and change your preferences.
We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website and online products, such as hosting and maintaining our message boards or chat rooms and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services or processing payments and making deliveries. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on any of these sites before signing up with and using them.
Security. Information collected by this Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our employees are required by us to maintain and uphold your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (including credit card information), transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.
Transfer of Your Information. As we continue to develop our activities, we might acquire or buy other entities or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our entity or assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
Minors. This Website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 18 or the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside. We will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts or memberships for, any child that we knows to be under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 18. If we nevertheless discover that we have received Personally Identifiable Information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or that we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian may request that the child’s information be corrected or deleted from our files by contacting our Privacy Coordinator at the telephone number or address set out below.
Contact Us/Review Your Information/Opt-Out. If you have submitted personally identifiable information through this Website, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at the address indicated below. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law. You may also contact us through either of the above methods to request or review the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. Our contact information is as follows:info@pacapts.com

Information Available on This Website
PAC may make financial and other information available through this Website. In some cases, the information may be audited. In most cases it will not have been audited. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “intends,” “believes,” “outlook” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. The information in this Website also may attempt to predict trends. Predictions obviously may or may not prove to be accurate. PAC considers portions of this Website to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: Our business and investment strategy; our projected operating results; availability of qualified personnel; local and national market conditions and trends in our industry; demand for and lease-up of apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, and other economic conditions; availability of debt and/or equity financing and availability on favorable terms; changes in our asset values; our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future; and economic trends and economic recoveries.
Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties appear in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” PAC does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its projected operating results. PAC may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community, the format and extent of which may be different from the format and extent of the information contained at this Website.
PAC also may make employment information available through this Website. PAC is an equal opportunity employer. PAC provides equal employment opportunity to qualified persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, veteran status, disability or other protected status.

Privacy Policy
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.
By accessing or otherwise using this website (the “Website”) you agree to be bound contractually by this Privacy Policy.
Effective Date: March 24, 2011
Modification of Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting amended terms on this Website. Your continued use after such notice indicates your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. You should check this Privacy Policy periodically for modifications by referencing the Effective Date posted above.
Privacy Statement. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (“PAC”) operates this Website. All references to “we”, “our” “us” and similar terms shall refer to PAC. We regard the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the services that we offer to our Website users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Registration Data. We reserve the right to require you to register to receive certain benefits, products or services and to provide certain registration data including your name, country, zip code or postal code (as appropriate) and email address (“Registration Data”).
Personally Identifiable Data. Personally identifiable information is any information that concerns you individually or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). For example, the Registration Data includes Personally Identifiable Information as does any other information you submit that identifies you individually. We will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any Personally Identifiable Information about you, do not voluntarily submit such information to us. You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit or browse our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit or view all sections of our Website. If you become a registered user and make postings on the Website, we may collect information about your postings. This information may include, without limitation, areas of our Website on which you post, the content of your post, posts that are responded to, and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate. You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Website, via telephone, in writing, or though any other means. We collect all information in these communications, and because such information may be Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Automatic Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit or browse our Website, or become a registered user of our Website, we may also collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include certain anonymous information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access our Website, the pages you access while on our Website, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us to understand the characteristics of people who visit our Website and to improve and market our Website in general. In the event that we link any Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat such information as Personally Identifiable Information and only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information We Use. We may use the Personally Identifiable Information collected through our Website primarily for such purposes as:

helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
processing postings and sending related communications;
providing services and support to users;
improving our Website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
responding to users’ questions, inquiries, comments and instructions;
maintaining the security and integrity of our systems; and
fulfilling your orders.

In general, we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Website and to improve our Website.
If you become a registered member of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. If you decide to “opt-in,” we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about online products, related information and news items that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you decide you no longer want to receive these communications from us, we will provide you with an option to “opt-out” and change your preferences.
We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website and online products, such as hosting and maintaining our message boards or chat rooms and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services or processing payments and making deliveries. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on any of these sites before signing up with and using them.
Security. Information collected by this Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our employees are required by us to maintain and uphold your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (including credit card information), transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.
Transfer of Your Information. As we continue to develop our activities, we might acquire or buy other entities or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our entity or assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
Minors. This Website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 18 or the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside. We will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts or memberships for, any child that we knows to be under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 18. If we nevertheless discover that we have received Personally Identifiable Information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or that we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian may request that the child’s information be corrected or deleted from our files by contacting our Privacy Coordinator at the telephone number or address set out below.
Contact Us/Review Your Information/Opt-Out. If you have submitted personally identifiable information through this Website, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at the address indicated below. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law. You may also contact us through either of the above methods to request or review the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. Our contact information is as follows:info@pacapts.com

Information Available on This Website
PAC may make financial and other information available through this Website. In some cases, the information may be audited. In most cases it will not have been audited. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “intends,” “believes,” “outlook” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters.

PAC considers portions of this Website to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: Our business and investment strategy; our projected operating results; availability of qualified personnel; local and national market conditions and trends in our industry; demand for and lease-up of apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, and other economic conditions; availability of debt and/or equity financing and availability on favorable terms; changes in our asset values; our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future; and economic trends and economic recoveries.
Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties appear in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” PAC does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its projected operating results. PAC may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community, the format and extent of which may be different from the format and extent of the information contained at this Website.

This information may include, without limitation, areas of our Website on which you post, the content of your post, posts that are responded to, and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate. You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Website, via telephone, in writing, or though any other means. We collect all information in these communications, and because such information may be Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Automatic Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit or browse our Website, or become a registered user of our Website, we may also collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include certain anonymous information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access our Website, the pages you access while on our Website, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us to understand the characteristics of people who visit our Website and to improve and market our Website in general. In the event that we link any Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat such information as Personally Identifiable Information and only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information We Use. We may use the Personally Identifiable Information collected through our Website primarily for such purposes as:

helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
processing postings and sending related communications;
providing services and support to users;
improving our Website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
responding to users’ questions, inquiries, comments and instructions;
maintaining the security and integrity of our systems; and
fulfilling your orders.

In general, we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Website and to improve our Website.
If you become a registered member of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. If you decide to “opt-in,” we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about online products, related information and news items that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you decide you no longer want to receive these communications from us, we will provide you with an option to “opt-out” and change your preferences.
We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website and online products, such as hosting and maintaining our message boards or chat rooms and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services or processing payments and making deliveries. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on any of these sites before signing up with and using them.
Security. Information collected by this Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our employees are required by us to maintain and uphold your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (including credit card information), transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.
Transfer of Your Information. As we continue to develop our activities, we might acquire or buy other entities or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our entity or assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
Minors. This Website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 18 or the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside. We will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts or memberships for, any child that we knows to be under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 18. If we nevertheless discover that we have received Personally Identifiable Information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or that we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian may request that the child’s information be corrected or deleted from our files by contacting our Privacy Coordinator at the telephone number or address set out below.
Contact Us/Review Your Information/Opt-Out. If you have submitted personally identifiable information through this Website, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at the address indicated below. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law. You may also contact us through either of the above methods to request or review the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. Our contact information is as follows:info@pacapts.com

Information Available on This Website
PAC may make financial and other information available through this Website. In some cases, the information may be audited. In most cases it will not have been audited. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “intends,” “believes,” “outlook” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters.

Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated.

The Offering is being made  to a final prospectus, dated March 16, 2017, which forms a part of the Companys registration statement on Form S-3 (File No.333-211924) (the "Registration Statement"), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2017.

ATLANTA, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:APTS) ("PAC" or the "Company") today announced the acquisition of a 280-unit Class A multifamily community in the Sarasota, Florida MSA constructed in 2016 called Luxe Lakewood Ranch.  "This acquisition demonstrates our continued focus to lower the average age of our premier Class A multifamily community portfolio," said John A. Williams, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for PAC.  Mr. Williams added, "Luxe Lakewood Ranch is ideally located in a superb master planned community, with immediate access to jobs, restaurants, shopping and recreational areas."



PAC acquired this community through a wholly-owned subsidiary and financed the acquisition utilizing a non-recourse first mortgage loan from Fannie Mae originated by Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC.  The first mortgage loan is approximately $39.3 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.93% per annum, matures in August 2027 and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule.  There are no loan guaranties provided by PAC or our operating partnership.
About Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc.
Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed primarily to acquire and operate multifamily properties in select targeted markets throughout the United States.  As part of our business strategy, we may enter into forward purchase contracts or purchase options for to-be-built multifamily communities and we may make real estate related loans, provide deposit arrangements, or provide performance assurances, as may be necessary or appropriate, in connection with the development of multifamily communities and other properties.  As a secondary strategy, we may acquire or originate senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in multifamily properties, membership or partnership interests in multifamily properties and other multifamily related assets and invest a lesser portion of our assets in other real estate related investments, including other income-producing property types, senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in other income-producing property types, membership or partnership interests in other income-producing property types as determined by our manager as appropriate for us.  At March 31, 2017, the Company was the approximate 96.8% owner of Preferred Apartment Communities Operating Partnership, L.P., the Company's operating partnership.  Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its tax year ended December 31, 2011.

ATLANTA, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:    APTS) ("PAC" or the "Company") today announced the acquisition on July 26, 2017 of Irmo Station, an approximately 99,384 square foot shopping center located in the Columbia, South Carolina MSA and anchored by a 56,942 square foot Kroger grocery store.  Irmo Station is strategically located just one mile off of Interstate Highway 26 (I-26), the main highway connecting Greenville, South Carolina to Charleston, South Carolina through Columbia. 













                New Market Logo (PRNewsfoto/Preferred Apartment Advisors)
              

 
 



PAC acquired this asset through its wholly-owned subsidiary New Market Properties, LLC. Joel T. Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer of New Market said about the acquisition, "We are thrilled to partner again with Kroger on this high sales volume location, and we believe the tenants at Irmo Station will continue to benefit from the surrounding dense three mile population of approximately 42,000 people and the affluent households with incomes of over $82,000." Mr. Murphy added, "The acquisition of Irmo Station increases the size of our retail portfolio to 34 grocery-anchored shopping centers across seven Sunbelt states, consistent with our strategy to acquire well-positioned grocery-anchored shopping centers in suburban Sunbelt markets with strong demographics."  
The Company financed the acquisition utilizing a non-recourse first mortgage loan from Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.  The first mortgage loan is approximately $10.65 million, bears interest at fixed rate of 3.94% per annum and matures on July 26, 2030.  There are no loan guaranties provided by PAC or its operating partnership.
About New Market Properties, LLC
New Market Properties, LLC is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. and is focused on the grocery anchored shopping center sector. New Market currently owns and operates a portfolio of grocery anchored shopping centers in seven Sunbelt states. Its strategy is to aggressively grow its existing portfolio throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Texas. New Market targets high quality suburban markets with dominant grocers such as Publix, Kroger, Harris Teeter, Tom Thumb and HEB.
About Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. 
Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed primarily to acquire and operate multifamily properties in select targeted markets throughout the United States.  As part of our business strategy, we may enter into forward purchase contracts or purchase options for to-be-built multifamily communities and we may make real estate related loans, provide deposit arrangements, or provide performance assurances, as may be necessary or appropriate, in connection with the development of multifamily communities and other properties.  As a secondary strategy, we may acquire or originate senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in multifamily properties, membership or partnership interests in multifamily properties and other multifamily related assets and invest a lesser portion of our assets in other real estate related investments, including other income-producing property types, senior mortgage loans, subordinate loans or real estate loans secured by interests in other income-producing property types, membership or partnership interests in other income-producing property types as determined by our manager as appropriate for us.  At March 31, 2017, the Company was the approximate 96.8% owner of Preferred Apartment Communities Operating Partnership, L.P., the Company's operating partnership.  Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its tax year ended December 31, 2011.

ATLANTA, March 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:    APTS) ("PAC" or the "Company") today announced the sale in the first quarter of 2017 of two Class A multifamily communities located in Kansas City, Kansas and Atlanta, Georgia.  PAC sold the properties for gross aggregate disposition proceeds of approximately $113.6 million.  The properties combined to have an average annualized return of approximately 19.1%.  "The attractive return on the sold properties provides PAC with further opportunities to reinvest our shareholders' capital into well-located, newly constructed and high-quality multifamily communities in our core markets," said John A. Williams, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for PAC.








The proceeds from one of the properties sold were deposited into a 1031 exchange account to be used for the acquisition of multiple assets in the future.  The 1031 mechanism will allow the Company to defer tax liability on the sale of an asset and more efficiently redeploy its capital.  The first use of these proceeds was for the acquisition of Retreat at Greystone, a Class A multifamily community in Birmingham, Alabama, the acquisition of which was previously announced on March 27, 2017. We expect to use the remaining proceeds from the 1031 exchange for future acquisitions.
About Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.10      Net Money Flow ($)  113,588    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Information We Use. We may use the Personally Identifiable Information collected through our Website primarily for such purposes as:

helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
processing postings and sending related communications;
providing services and support to users;
improving our Website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
responding to users’ questions, inquiries, comments and instructions;
maintaining the security and integrity of our systems; and
fulfilling your orders.

In general, we use the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your experience, to assist you in using our Website and to improve our Website.
If you become a registered member of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. If you decide to “opt-in,” we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about online products, related information and news items that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you decide you no longer want to receive these communications from us, we will provide you with an option to “opt-out” and change your preferences.
We also use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Website.
Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. We reserve the right to use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests. Advertisers that display ads on our Website may also use cookies; however, we do not have access to the information obtained from cookies issued from other sites.
IP Addresses. IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referrers. A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as “traffic data”. We reserve the right to use this information to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information. System information that we collect as part of “traffic data” includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a website. We reserve the right to use this information for purposes of identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information. We feel strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you to our affiliates. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For instance, we may provide information to third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website and online products, such as hosting and maintaining our message boards or chat rooms and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services or processing payments and making deliveries. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.
Other Websites, Links, And Advertisers. This Website contains links to other websites. We reserve this right to have advertisers or other third parties on this Website who may also have links on this Website and may link to this Website. The privacy practices of advertisers or websites linked to this Website are not covered by this privacy statement, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to this Website, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on any of these sites before signing up with and using them.
Security. Information collected by this Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our employees are required by us to maintain and uphold your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (including credit card information), transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. In addition, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of security or a physical threat to you or others.
Please note that if you give out personal identification information online, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.
Transfer of Your Information. As we continue to develop our activities, we might acquire or buy other entities or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our entity or assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
Minors. This Website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 18 or the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside. We will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts or memberships for, any child that we knows to be under the age of 18. We do not solicit or knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 18. If we nevertheless discover that we have received Personally Identifiable Information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or that we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian may request that the child’s information be corrected or deleted from our files by contacting our Privacy Coordinator at the telephone number or address set out below.

If you have submitted personally identifiable information through this Website, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at the address indicated below. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law.
