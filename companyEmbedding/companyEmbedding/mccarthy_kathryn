It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Kathryn’s Full ProfileSummaryI design because I believe that when you wear something that makes you feel strong, you become strong. My goal is to make women feel powerful and beautiful so that they can reach ever higher and surpass any of the twists or turns that might block their paths. I hope that, in the near future, my designs will be worn by a generation of women climbing the career ladder and shattering the glass ceiling.My aesthetic is inherently feminine. Tenacious women and a delicate style may seem like a contradiction, but who says feminine can’t be strong? Who says a CEO can’t wear feminine clothes and be taken seriously? Because frankly, whoever said so was an idiot. That being said, my design aesthetic is flexible and I can easily transition between different aesthetics and markets. In 2016 I interned for The New Standard Edition (TNSE), a contemporary menswear brand based in New York, NY. During my time there I had the opportunity to design their spring 2017 collection, execute the collection's tech packs, and communicate with factories in China to insure production progressed smoothly. The collection went on sale on TNSE's website in February 2017 and went on sale on nordstromrack.com in April 2017.I recently finished making my senior collection, Dans La Lune, for this year’s senior fashion show at Stephens College. Dans La Lune is inspired by the Art Nouveau movement and is a women’s designer RTW collection. It is filled with fantasy and magic. Think of a secret garden where fairies flutter from flower to flower unbeknownst to the garden’s keeper and you have the essence of Dans La Lune.SkillsFashionFashion DesignPhotoshopInDesignIllustratorSewingFrenchGraphic DesignFashion IllustrationPattern MakingApparel DesignProduct DevelopmentSketchingAdobe IllustratorAdobe IndesignSee 8+Adobe PhotoshopAdobe MuseBloggingLeadershipOrganizationTime ManagementSocial MediaMicrosoft PowerPointSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationStephens CollegeBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Fashion Design and Product DevelopmentBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Fashion Design and Product Development2013  –  2017Activities and Societies: Alpha Lambda Delta Honors Society, Mortar BoardHonors & AwardsDeans List with High HonorsStephens CollegeAugust 2013I was on the Deans List with High Honors all through college.School of Fashion & Design Award for Academic ExcellenceSchool of Fashion & DesignAugust 2013I was awarded the School of Fashion & Design Award for Academic Excellence all through college.Stephens Honors ProgramStephens CollegeAugust 2013I was member of the Stephens College Honors House Plan (HHP) and lived in a designated honors dorm during my freshman year.Mortar Board MemberMortar Board Athena ChapterAugust 2016During my senior year I was a member Mortar Board and helped organize events such as Safe Trick-or-Treat for families in the Columbia community.LanguagesEnglishNative or bilingual proficiencyFrenchProfessional working proficiencyProjectsGet SmartStarting September 2015Get Smart is a client project in which I designed the marketing materials for the City of Columbia’s Office of Cultural Affairs (OCA) new public art app, Otocast, available in the iTunes app store.

This swimsuit cover-up was my final draped project. During the jury of selection, the dress was critiqued by a panel of professionals from the fashion industry and admitted into our annual fashion show.Team members: Kathryn McCarthyContemporary SportswearOctober 2015  –  December 2015Contemporary Sportswear is a better sportswear and dress class in which I developed a portfolio of seven original designs, which were critiqued by a professional designer. Two ensembles were constructed and fit to a model, a three piece look and a dress. My concept, Oceanus Fractus, drew inspiration from the presence of fractals in the ocean.Team members: Kathryn McCarthyCreative Ink: Exsor Brand IdentityJanuary 2016  –  April 2016Throughout the Spring of 2016 I worked as a creative executive for Creative Ink.

The culmination of learning these techniques was developing a portfolio of four original coat and dress designs for the bridge market. My concept stemmed from symbolism in Ancient Egypt, mainly the lotus (a symbol of creation) and the Egyptian gods. I designed the laser cut leather on the dress back and the engineered print for the coat lining.Team members: Kathryn McCarthySwimwearStarting April 2016Cranes and plum blossoms is a swim collection inspired by Geisha costumes and kimono motifs, specifically cranes as a symbol of longevity and plum blossoms as a symbol of renewal.

While I interned in fashion design for TNSE I had the opportunity to design and make tech packs for the Spring ’17 collection.
