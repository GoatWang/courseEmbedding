Batanga, Inc. Acquires Hispanic Social Network MetroFlog

		  MetroFlog, MetroBlog and MetroPostales all join the Batanga, Inc. family of premium Hispanic-focused online properties
		

Sep 12, 2011, 06:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Batanga, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


MIAMI, Sept. 12, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Batanga, Inc. today announced the acquisition of MetroFlog and partner sites, MetroBlog and MetroPostales. On the heels of acquiring two leading online media companies, Adfunky and I-Network, Batanga, Inc., has now added all three premium Hispanic-focused properties to its roster of owned and operated websites. The latest acquisition increases the company's audience by over six million unique visitors a month.
MetroFlog.com is a social media platform that allows users to create individual spaces where they upload personal photos and share them among all other users. To date, MetroFlog users have published over twenty million photographs, uploading an additional sixty thousand photos daily. The photo blogs serve as catalyst for comments, guest signatures, making friends, and are at the core of the social experience on MetroFlog.com. 
MetroBlog.com was developed on a common platform, enabling users to publish personal blogs as a means for social interaction. Users are encouraged to publish their thoughts, writings, and journal entries to share with other users such as themselves. MetroPostales provides users with hundreds of electronic greeting cards to share with friends and loved ones. Each of the properties provides Hispanics online with unique opportunities to communicate and network with one another. 
"Our latest acquisition further solidifies our commitment to developing and delivering relevant and quality content to the Hispanic online audience. MetroFlog provides users with an alternative social experience that allows them to communicate and express themselves," said Rafael Urbina, Chairman and CEO, Batanga, Inc. "We are thrilled to add such a dynamic social platform to the Batanga, Inc. family of sites and eager to introduce them to advertisers."
Batanga, Inc. is now the largest independent digital media company serving U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets. Their continued investment to these markets provides advertisers with priceless insights and value, in addition to countless opportunities to not only reach, but engage with Hispanics online.
MetroFlog and its partner sites have demonstrated the ability to build social experiences while growing audiences at exponential rates. Combined, the sites have approximately seventeen million registered users and disseminate over one million unique emails daily, notifying users that their contacts have posted a new photo or blog. Batanga, Inc. will leverage those technologies and resources across their current portfolio of properties starting with Batanga.com.
