Warning



                    Adding this test will result in an order that contains multiple clinical areas.
                    If you choose to add this test, you will need to send in two sample tubes
                    and your order will represent two billable events.
                    Your test results will be delivered as two reports.
                    Please contact
                    Client Services with any questions.
                

                    Add this test to my order:

This test either contains genes that were not available at the time of your original order or that
                    are in a different clinical area from your original order. These genes are shown in purple.
You may be able to remove these genes from the test to make it eligible for re-requisition, or, to
                    order all genes, you will need to send in another sample tube and your order will be billed $475
                    either to your institution or as patient pay.
Please contact
                    Client Services with any questions.
Do you want to add this test to your order?




Yes

No








×
Confirm


Removing these genes will change this order to a re-requisition. Re-requisitions are offered at no
                    additional charge and do not require an additional sample tube.
To add genes that are eligible for re-requisition, select from the Test Catalog or previously saved
                    custom orders. These genes are shown in blue in the Test Catalog.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in
this offering will be approximately $91.4 million, based on the initial public
offering price, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' option to
purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that we
will receive additional net proceeds of $14.2 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, increase our visibility in the marketplace, establish a
public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the
public capital markets. We currently intend to use the proceeds from this
offering as follows:

. between approximately $24.0 million and $28.0 million for research and 
  development, including assay development, software development for our 
  analysis pipeline and our clinical report optimization platform, or CROP; 

. between approximately $23.0 million and $27.0 million for selling and 
  marketing activities, including development and operation of our web site 
  for taking and delivering customer orders, hiring sales, customer service 
  and marketing personnel, and marketing programs, including attendance at 
  conferences; 

. between approximately $4.0 million and $6.0 million for capital expenditures, 
  including investment in additional laboratory capacity, sample preparation 
  and sequencing equipment and computer systems for generating, analyzing and 
  storing genetic information; and 

. the remainder for corporate and administrative expenses (including personnel-
  related costs and costs associated with operating as a public company), and 
  for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering described above
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors,
including competitive and technological developments, the number of billable
tests we perform, our success in obtaining reimbursement, our ability to lower
the costs associated with performing our tests, the amount of cash generated by
our operations, the timing and amount of investments in our business, demand for
tests with expanded genetic content, demand for enhancement of our analysis
pipeline and CROP to service greater assay volume potentially at reduced
turnaround times, utilization of our website for taking and delivering customer
orders, the need for sales, customer service and marketing personnel to drive
demand and address customer requirements, and the need for increased amounts of
laboratory capacity, sample preparation and sequencing equipment and computer
systems for generating, analyzing and storing genetic information. If our
development of additional assays or systems requires more resources than we
anticipate, we may allocate additional proceeds from this offering to our
research and development activities. If market acceptance of and reimbursement
for our assays is slower than we anticipate, we may reallocate a portion of the
proceeds from research and development and capital expenditures to selling and
marketing activities.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to license,
acquire or invest in complementary business, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current plans, commitments or obligations to do so.
Accordingly, our management team will have broad discretion in using the net
proceeds to be received by us from this offering. Pending the use of proceeds
from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government.


Our competitors include companies that offer molecular genetic testing services,
including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single and
multi-gene tests. Principal competitors include companies such as Myriad
Genetics, Ambry Genetics, GeneDx, a subsidiary of Bio-Reference Laboratories,
Laboratory Corporation of America and Quest Diagnostics, as well as other
commercial and academic labs. In addition to the companies that currently offer
traditional genetic testing services and research centers, other established and
emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may
commercialize competitive products including informatics, analysis, integrated
genetic tools and services for health and wellness.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are: 

. price and quality of tests; 
 
. turnaround time of testing results; 

. coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors; 

. breadth and depth of content; 
 
. convenience of testing; 

. brand recognition of test provider; 
 
. additional value-added services and informatics tools; 
 
. accessibility of results; 
 
. client service; 

. quality of website content; and 

. reliability. 

We believe that we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these
factors. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market
penetration, substantially greater financial, technological and research and
development resources and selling and marketing capabilities, more experience
dealing with third-party payors. As a result, they may be able to respond more
quickly to changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of their tests than we do, or sell their tests
at prices designed to win significant levels of market share. We may not be able
to compete effectively against these organizations.


Company Description
Invitae's mission is to bring comprehensive genetic information into mainstream
medical practice to improve the quality of healthcare for billions of people.
Our goal is to aggregate most of the world's genetic tests into a single service
with higher quality, faster turnaround time and lower price


 than many single
gene tests today. We were founded on four core principles:

. Patients should own and control their own genetic information; 

. Healthcare professionals are fundamental in ordering and interpreting genetic
  information; 

. Genetic information is more valuable when shared; and 

. Driving down the price of genetic information will increase its clinical and
  personal utility. 

As the price of DNA sequencing has declined, the amount of genetic information
that can be generated per dollar has increased exponentially, enabling the
generation, analysis and storage of more comprehensive genetic information than
ever before. According to Online Mendelian Inheritence in Man, or OMIM, a
compendium of human genes maintained by Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, there are more than 4,000 inherited genetic conditions for which the
scientific and medical community has already identified specific genes and
variants useful for diagnosis or treatment planning. By aggregating large
numbers of currently available genetic tests into a single service, we can
achieve great economies of scale that allow us to not only provide primary
single gene or multi-gene tests but also to generate and store additional
genetic information on behalf of the patient for future use. We refer to the
service of managing genetic information over the course of disease or the
lifetime of a patient as "genome management." In addition, as more individuals
gain access to their genetic information, we believe that sharing genetic
information will provide an economic opportunity for patients and us to
participate in advancing the understanding and treatment of disease. We believe
that our ongoing investment in building our infrastructure and attracting talent
across a range of disciplines to generate, interpret and manage genetic
information will position us to be a leader in the field of genetic testing and
genome management.

We believe that genes are a fundamental particle of modern medicine and that
genetic testing has the potential to affect billions of people. Virtually
everyone is carrying loss of function mutations in their genome, recessive
genetic conditions that may affect their extended family or genetic mutations
that may affect their response to various drugs or therapies. Every individual
has a unique genome, and we believe that comprehensive knowledge of this genetic
makeup will be foundational to the future practice of medicine. We also believe
that eventually many individuals in a modern healthcare system will have their
genome sequenced at birth or during the course of their lives.

According to UnitedHealth Group Inc., the U.S. genetic testing and molecular
diagnostics market in 2010 was estimated to be approximately $5 billion, of
which approximately 60% was genetic testing. As of December 2014, genetests.org
estimated that there were more than 40,000 different genetic tests available
from over 650 laboratories. Based on UnitedHealth's estimates for the growth of
the genetic testing and molecular diagnostics market and our assumption that
genetic testing's share of this market will be held constant at approximately
60% between 2010 and 2021, we expect the U.S. genetic testing market to grow to
at least $9 billion by 2021.

We are headquartered in San Francisco, California, where we have offices and a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified facility. We also
have offices in Palo Alto, California as well as a second laboratory in
Santiago, Chile. We have a multi-disciplinary team of 161 people as of
December 31, 2014, including bioinformaticians, clinical and medical
geneticists, commercial and managed care experts, genetic counselors,
scientists, software engineers, web developers, graphic designers and lab
automation specialists, as well as administrative and corporate personnel. We
believe that creating a strong team is a competitive advantage, and we strive to
foster a motivating and unique culture in which our people can thrive.

In the near term, we plan to focus on the immediate market for symptomatic
disease with the goal to aggregate testing for large numbers of genetic diseases
into a single low-cost service. In the future, we plan on expanding our efforts
in carrier and newborn testing markets and later into the health and wellness
market. As our market share grows we expect that our business will develop in
three stages over the longer term:

. Genetic testing: making genetic testing more affordable and more accessible 
  with faster turnaround time than ever before. We believe that there is a 
  significant market opportunity for high volume, low cost genetic testing that
  can allow us to serve a large number of clients. 

. Genome management: building a secure and trusted genome management 
  infrastructure. By generating and storing large amounts of individualized 
  genetic information for every patient sample, we believe we can create value 
  over the course of disease or lifetime of a client. 

. Genome network: sharing genetic information on a global scale to advance 
  science and medicine. We plan to help patients share their genetic 
  information in a way that benefits them and us by acting as a permission-
  based broker on their behalf.

name Locus Development, Inc. and changed our name to Invitae Corporation in 
2012. Our principal executive offices are located at 458 Brannan Street, San 
Francisco, California 94107, and our telephone number is (415) 374–7782. Our
