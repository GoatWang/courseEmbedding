Cenovus is a Canadian oil company

        When we became a company, back in 2009, we made a commitment to be a responsible developer of one of Canada’s most valuable resources – the oil sands. It’s a commitment we take seriously. 

By applying the latest technology and fresh, progressive thinking to our work, we’re able to minimize our impact on the environment while safely producing energy resources the world needs. These energy resources help transport people, goods and services. They heat and cool homes. And they’re used to make everyday items like detergent, smartphones and sports equipment.          
We’re focused on two growth platforms to create long-term value for our shareholders. That includes our top-tier assets in the oil sands region in northern Alberta where we drill for oil and use specialized methods to pump it to the surface. We also have a large land base with significant production in the Deep Basin, a liquids-rich natural gas fairway in Alberta and British Columbia. In addition, Cenovus has other established conventional natural gas and oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan and 50 percent ownership in two U.S. refineries. We’re based in Calgary, Alberta and our shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol CVE.

 Cenovus’s  Christina Lake project in northern Alberta uses steam-assisted gravity drainage  (SAGD) technology to produce oil. The  process involves drilling into the reservoir and injecting steam at a low  pressure to soften the oil so it can be pumped to the surface.

In addition, Cenovus has other established conventional natural gas and oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan and 50 percent ownership in two U.S. refineries.

Top Company Interviews

Calgary, Alberta (July 27, 2017) - Cenovus Energy Inc. (TSX: CVE) (NYSE: CVE) had a strong second quarter that reflected 45 days of results from the assets recently acquired from ConocoPhillips. The acquisition gives Cenovus 100% ownership of its oil sands operations and a new production platform in the liquids-rich Deep Basin. Integration of the Deep Basin assets is on track. To further optimize its portfolio and deleverage its balance sheet, the company is pursuing the sale of its legacy conventional oil and natural gas assets, and the sale processes are proceeding well. Cenovus continues to target between $4 billion and $5 billion in announced asset sale agreements during 2017.
      
      
        Key highlights
      
      


            Increased second quarter adjusted funds flow by 80% to $792 million or $0.71 per share compared with the same period in 2016
          

            Increased free funds flow by 128% from the second quarter of 2016 to $465 million
          

            Reduced planned 2017 capital spending by approximately $200 million to $1.7 billion at the midpoint, with no expected impact to forecast production volumes

Cenovus Energy Inc. (pronounced se-nō-vus) is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta.
Cenovus was formed on December 1, 2009 when Encana Corporation split into two distinct companies,[1] with Cenovus becoming a focused integrated oil company. Some of Cenovus’s assets formerly belonged to PanCanadian Energy Corp. and Alberta Energy Company (AEC), the two Canadian oil and gas companies that merged to form Encana in 2002.
In March 2017, Cenovus reached an agreement to purchase ConocoPhillips’ 50% share of their FCCL oil sands projects, as well as most of their Deep Basin conventional assets in Alberta and British Columbia.[2] That deal closed on May 17.[3]
Cenovus is known for being a responsible developer of Canada’s oil sands, with an emphasis on innovation, safety and environmental stewardship.[4] The company’s business strategy focuses on creating value through the development its oil sands assets, achieving predictable, reliable performance and maintaining financial resilience.[5] Cenovus shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol CVE.

Operations[edit]
Oil sands[edit]
Cenovus has two producing projects in the Alberta oil sands – Foster Creek and Christina Lake (Alberta). On May 17, 2017, Foster Creek and Christina Lake became 100 percent owned and operated by Cenovus.[3]
Conventional oil and gas[edit]
Cenovus also has conventional oil and natural gas operations across Alberta and Saskatchewan, including the Weyburn oilfield in Saskatchewan, which is the largest CO2 enhanced oil recovery operation in Canada. It’s also the site of the largest geological greenhouse gas storage project in the world, with about 27 million tonnes of CO2 safely stored underground. This has been extensively studied by researchers as part of the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project.[6]
In May 2017, Cenovus assumed ownership of ConocoPhillips’ Deep Basin assets in Alberta and British Columbia.[3] This liquids-rich acquisition includes more than 3 million net acres of land.
Refining[edit]
Cenovus has 50 percent ownership in two refineries in the United States: the Wood River Refinery (Illinois) and Borger, Texas refinery. Phillips 66 is the co-owner and operator.[7]
Natural gas processing[edit]
Part of the Deep Basin acquisition included natural-gas processing facilities, many of which are now majority owned and operated by Cenovus. The plants process produced natural gas to make it pipeline-ready.
Transportation[edit]
Cenovus owns a crude-by-rail loading facility near Edmonton, Alberta – the Bruderheim Energy Terminal. The company was recognized for its rail safety performance in 2016.[8]
Technology[edit]
The primary technology Cenovus uses at its Foster Creek and Christina Lake projects is called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Cenovus also applies different associated technologies to enhance the SAGD process, such as electric submersible pumps at Foster Creek and solvent aided process (SAP) at Christina Lake.
In 2011, the company began applying its blowdown boiler technology to improve the efficiency of water use at its oil sands operations.[9] In 2013, Cenovus developed its SkyStrat™ drilling rig that allows an exploratory rig to be flown into remote areas by helicopter piece-by-piece, set up to drill a test well, dismantled and airlifted away. The process requires no roads, meaning little disturbance to the boreal forest.[10] The company received an Environmental Performance award for the SkyStrat™ program.[11]
Environment[edit]
Cenovus has been recognized for its efforts in environmental stewardship.[12] The company continues to work at improving its environmental performance for air,[13] land[14] and water.[15] Cenovus is focusing on reducing its impact on wildlife habitats particularly to help protect declining woodland caribou.[16]
Cenovus is a member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA).
Safety[edit]
Employees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are required to understand and work by the company’s policies and practices.[17] There’s a strong emphasis on the importance of safe driving. Cenovus is an alcohol- and drug-free workplace.
Community investment[edit]
Cenovus is an Imagine Canada Caring company.[18] This means the company gives one percent of its pre-tax profits to charitable or non-profit organizations. Since 2009, the company has also invested $1.8 billion on goods and services supplied by Aboriginal businesses near its operations.[19]
Worker housing[edit]
Cenovus provides housing for staff and other contract workers, commonly known as "camps", who work at their Christina Lake and Foster Creek projects and other locations in northern Alberta.[20] A few of the bigger camps house up to 800 people when operations are at peak capacity. The camps employ housekeeping, kitchen, janitorial and technical support staff, as well as electricians and paramedics who work and live for a short time on-site as part of a shift rotation.

In 2011, the company began applying its blowdown boiler technology to improve the efficiency of water use at its oil sands operations.[9] In 2013, Cenovus developed its SkyStrat™ drilling rig that allows an exploratory rig to be flown into remote areas by helicopter piece-by-piece, set up to drill a test well, dismantled and airlifted away. The process requires no roads, meaning little disturbance to the boreal forest.[10] The company received an Environmental Performance award for the SkyStrat™ program.[11]
Environment[edit]
Cenovus has been recognized for its efforts in environmental stewardship.[12] The company continues to work at improving its environmental performance for air,[13] land[14] and water.[15] Cenovus is focusing on reducing its impact on wildlife habitats particularly to help protect declining woodland caribou.[16]
Cenovus is a member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA).
Safety[edit]
Employees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are required to understand and work by the company’s policies and practices.[17] There’s a strong emphasis on the importance of safe driving. Cenovus is an alcohol- and drug-free workplace.
Community investment[edit]
Cenovus is an Imagine Canada Caring company.[18] This means the company gives one percent of its pre-tax profits to charitable or non-profit organizations. Since 2009, the company has also invested $1.8 billion on goods and services supplied by Aboriginal businesses near its operations.[19]
Worker housing[edit]
Cenovus provides housing for staff and other contract workers, commonly known as "camps", who work at their Christina Lake and Foster Creek projects and other locations in northern Alberta.[20] A few of the bigger camps house up to 800 people when operations are at peak capacity. The camps employ housekeeping, kitchen, janitorial and technical support staff, as well as electricians and paramedics who work and live for a short time on-site as part of a shift rotation.

Cenovus Energy Inc. (pronounced se-nō-vus) is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta.
Cenovus was formed on December 1, 2009 when Encana Corporation split into two distinct companies,[1] with Cenovus becoming a focused integrated oil company. Some of Cenovus’s assets formerly belonged to PanCanadian Energy Corp. and Alberta Energy Company (AEC), the two Canadian oil and gas companies that merged to form Encana in 2002.
In March 2017, Cenovus reached an agreement to purchase ConocoPhillips’ 50% share of their FCCL oil sands projects, as well as most of their Deep Basin conventional assets in Alberta and British Columbia.[2] That deal closed on May 17.[3]
Cenovus is known for being a responsible developer of Canada’s oil sands, with an emphasis on innovation, safety and environmental stewardship.[4] The company’s business strategy focuses on creating value through the development its oil sands assets, achieving predictable, reliable performance and maintaining financial resilience.[5] Cenovus shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol CVE.

Operations[edit]
Oil sands[edit]
Cenovus has two producing projects in the Alberta oil sands – Foster Creek and Christina Lake (Alberta). On May 17, 2017, Foster Creek and Christina Lake became 100 percent owned and operated by Cenovus.[3]
Conventional oil and gas[edit]
Cenovus also has conventional oil and natural gas operations across Alberta and Saskatchewan, including the Weyburn oilfield in Saskatchewan, which is the largest CO2 enhanced oil recovery operation in Canada. It’s also the site of the largest geological greenhouse gas storage project in the world, with about 27 million tonnes of CO2 safely stored underground. This has been extensively studied by researchers as part of the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project.[6]
In May 2017, Cenovus assumed ownership of ConocoPhillips’ Deep Basin assets in Alberta and British Columbia.[3] This liquids-rich acquisition includes more than 3 million net acres of land.
Refining[edit]
Cenovus has 50 percent ownership in two refineries in the United States: the Wood River Refinery (Illinois) and Borger, Texas refinery. Phillips 66 is the co-owner and operator.[7]
Natural gas processing[edit]
Part of the Deep Basin acquisition included natural-gas processing facilities, many of which are now majority owned and operated by Cenovus. The plants process produced natural gas to make it pipeline-ready.
Transportation[edit]
Cenovus owns a crude-by-rail loading facility near Edmonton, Alberta – the Bruderheim Energy Terminal. The company was recognized for its rail safety performance in 2016.[8]
Technology[edit]
The primary technology Cenovus uses at its Foster Creek and Christina Lake projects is called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Cenovus also applies different associated technologies to enhance the SAGD process, such as electric submersible pumps at Foster Creek and solvent aided process (SAP) at Christina Lake.
In 2011, the company began applying its blowdown boiler technology to improve the efficiency of water use at its oil sands operations.[9] In 2013, Cenovus developed its SkyStrat™ drilling rig that allows an exploratory rig to be flown into remote areas by helicopter piece-by-piece, set up to drill a test well, dismantled and airlifted away.

Cenovus is a member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA).
Safety[edit]
Employees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are required to understand and work by the company’s policies and practices.[17] There’s a strong emphasis on the importance of safe driving. Cenovus is an alcohol- and drug-free workplace.

Cenovus Energy Inc. (pronounced se-nō-vus) is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta.
Cenovus was formed on December 1, 2009 when Encana Corporation split into two distinct companies,[1] with Cenovus becoming a focused integrated oil company. Some of Cenovus’s assets formerly belonged to PanCanadian Energy Corp. and Alberta Energy Company (AEC), the two Canadian oil and gas companies that merged to form Encana in 2002.
In March 2017, Cenovus reached an agreement to purchase ConocoPhillips’ 50% share of their FCCL oil sands projects, as well as most of their Deep Basin conventional assets in Alberta and British Columbia.[2] That deal closed on May 17.[3]
Cenovus is known for being a responsible developer of Canada’s oil sands, with an emphasis on innovation, safety and environmental stewardship.[4] The company’s business strategy focuses on creating value through the development its oil sands assets, achieving predictable, reliable performance and maintaining financial resilience.[5] Cenovus shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol CVE.

Operations[edit]
Oil sands[edit]
Cenovus has two producing projects in the Alberta oil sands – Foster Creek and Christina Lake (Alberta). On May 17, 2017, Foster Creek and Christina Lake became 100 percent owned and operated by Cenovus.[3]
Conventional oil and gas[edit]
Cenovus also has conventional oil and natural gas operations across Alberta and Saskatchewan, including the Weyburn oilfield in Saskatchewan, which is the largest CO2 enhanced oil recovery operation in Canada. It’s also the site of the largest geological greenhouse gas storage project in the world, with about 27 million tonnes of CO2 safely stored underground. This has been extensively studied by researchers as part of the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project.[6]
In May 2017, Cenovus assumed ownership of ConocoPhillips’ Deep Basin assets in Alberta and British Columbia.[3] This liquids-rich acquisition includes more than 3 million net acres of land.
Refining[edit]
Cenovus has 50 percent ownership in two refineries in the United States: the Wood River Refinery (Illinois) and Borger, Texas refinery. Phillips 66 is the co-owner and operator.[7]
Natural gas processing[edit]
Part of the Deep Basin acquisition included natural-gas processing facilities, many of which are now majority owned and operated by Cenovus. The plants process produced natural gas to make it pipeline-ready.
Transportation[edit]
Cenovus owns a crude-by-rail loading facility near Edmonton, Alberta – the Bruderheim Energy Terminal. The company was recognized for its rail safety performance in 2016.[8]
Technology[edit]
The primary technology Cenovus uses at its Foster Creek and Christina Lake projects is called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Cenovus also applies different associated technologies to enhance the SAGD process, such as electric submersible pumps at Foster Creek and solvent aided process (SAP) at Christina Lake.
In 2011, the company began applying its blowdown boiler technology to improve the efficiency of water use at its oil sands operations.[9] In 2013, Cenovus developed its SkyStrat™ drilling rig that allows an exploratory rig to be flown into remote areas by helicopter piece-by-piece, set up to drill a test well, dismantled and airlifted away. The process requires no roads, meaning little disturbance to the boreal forest.[10] The company received an Environmental Performance award for the SkyStrat™ program.[11]
Environment[edit]
Cenovus has been recognized for its efforts in environmental stewardship.[12] The company continues to work at improving its environmental performance for air,[13] land[14] and water.[15] Cenovus is focusing on reducing its impact on wildlife habitats particularly to help protect declining woodland caribou.[16]
Cenovus is a member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA).
Safety[edit]
Employees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are required to understand and work by the company’s policies and practices.[17] There’s a strong emphasis on the importance of safe driving. Cenovus is an alcohol- and drug-free workplace.
Community investment[edit]
Cenovus is an Imagine Canada Caring company.[18] This means the company gives one percent of its pre-tax profits to charitable or non-profit organizations. Since 2009, the company has also invested $1.8 billion on goods and services supplied by Aboriginal businesses near its operations.[19]
Worker housing[edit]
Cenovus provides housing for staff and other contract workers, commonly known as "camps", who work at their Christina Lake and Foster Creek projects and other locations in northern Alberta.[20] A few of the bigger camps house up to 800 people when operations are at peak capacity. The camps employ housekeeping, kitchen, janitorial and technical support staff, as well as electricians and paramedics who work and live for a short time on-site as part of a shift rotation.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
