other than federal and, if applicable, state tax purposes, and this

No Member, as such, shall be required to lend any funds to the
Company or to make any additional contribution of capital to the
Company, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by this
Agreement. Any Member may, with the approval of the Majority
Members, make loans to the Company, and any loan by a Member to the

creditors of the
 
3 





 

Company or to any other third party,
for the debts, liabilities, commitments or any other obligations of
the Company or for any losses of the Company, and therefore, a
Member shall be liable only to make Capital Contributions to the
Company and the other payments as provided herein. To the extent
that, at law or in equity, a Member or other Person has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to

securities or interests convertible or exchangeable into Units or
other interests in the Company and (iii) warrants, options or
other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Units or other
interests in the Company. Upon the acquisition of any Units or
other interests in the Company by a Person who is not a Member,
such Person shall execute and deliver a counterpart of this
Agreement and shall become a Member hereunder, and Schedule
A hereto shall be amended to reflect such issuance and new
Member.
 

3.5.        
Distributions. Subject to the provision of
Section 18-607 of the Act, the Majority Members shall have
sole discretion regarding the amounts and timing of distributions
to Members, in each case subject to the retention of, or payment to

the reasonable business needs of the Company which shall include
(but not by way of limitation) the payment or the making of
provision for the payment when due of Company obligations,
including the payment of any management or administrative fees and
expenses or any other obligations.
 

ARTICLE IV

MANAGEMENT
 

4.1.        
Management by the Members. The powers of the Company shall

and take all actions for the Company.
 

4.2.        
Actions by Members; Delegation of Authority and
Duties.
 

(a)          
In managing the business and affairs of the Company and exercising
its powers, the Majority Members shall act through

4.3 and 4.4 , and (ii) any Person to whom authority
and duties have been delegated pursuant to
Section 4.2(b) .
 

(b)          
The Majority Members may, from time to time, delegate to one or
more Persons such authority and duties as the Majority Members may
deem advisable. In addition, the
 
4 





 

Majority Members may assign titles
(including, without limitation, chairman, chief executive officer,
president, vice president, secretary, assistant secretary,
treasurer and assistant treasurer) to any such Persons and delegate
to such other individuals certain authority and duties. Any number
of titles may be held by the same individual. Any delegation
pursuant to this Section 4.2(b)  may be revoked at
any time by the Majority Members.
 

4.3.        
Meetings.
 

(a)          
The Majority Members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business of the Company, and except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, the act of the Majority Members present at a
meeting of the Members at which a quorum is present shall be the
act of the Members.
 

(b)          
Meetings of the Members may be held at such place or places as

by resolution of the Majority Members. Regular meetings of the
Members shall be held at such times and places as shall be
designated from time to time by resolution of the Majority Members.
Notice of such meetings shall not be required. Special meetings of
the Members may be called by the Majority Members, and notice of
such meeting need not state the purpose or purposes of, nor the
business to be transacted at, such meeting, except as may otherwise
be required by law.
 

4.4.        
Action by Written Consent or Telephone Conference. Any
action permitted or required by the Act, the Certificate or this
Agreement to be taken at a meeting of the Members may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action
to be taken, is signed by the Majority Members. Such consent shall
have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote at a meeting and
may be stated as such in any document or instrument filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware, and the execution of such consent
shall constitute attendance or presence in person at a meeting of
the Members. Subject to the requirements of the Act, the
Certificate or this Agreement for notice of meetings, unless
otherwise restricted by the Certificate, the Members may
participate in and hold a meeting by means of a telephone
conference or similar communications equipment by means of which
all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in such meeting shall constitute attendance and
presence in person at such meeting.

Conflicts of Interest. Each Member and officer of the
Company at any time and from time to time may engage in and own
interests in other business ventures of any and every type and
description, independently or with others (including ones in
competition with the Company) with no obligation to offer to the
Company or any other Member or officer the right to participate
therein. The Company may transact business with any Member, officer
or affiliate thereof; provided that the terms of those
transactions are no less favorable than those the Company could
obtain from unrelated third parties.
