              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Dividend Sustainability Portfolio (DVST0173)
	
	




Objective
		  	
		
		The Portfolio seeks above average capital appreciation. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks derived from the Standard & Poor's 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index consists of stocks of those companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that have increased their actual dividend payments in each of the last 25 years.



A dividend growers domestic option
What makes an aristocrat? A commitment to dividends. The strategy invests in companies that have shown their ability to provide consistent and competitive income potential. 



Totalreturn
 
Incomesustainability
 
Access to industry leaders 


Corporate managers use stable and increasing dividends as a sign of confidence in their firm's prospects, which we believe is important to sustainable income and capital appreciation. 
 
Companies with strong dividend coverage should be able to increase dividend payments.
 
A dividend aristocrat tends to be a large blue-chip company and many of the companies listed on
the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index are familiar household names.

The style characteristics of the Portfolio are determined as of the initial date of deposit. For a complete description of these characteristics, see below.

Key Stats



Weighted Avg P/E 
22.05


Weighted Avg P/B 
-7.27


Weighted Avg Market Cap (MM) 
$100,843.00




Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.

 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
 Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.  This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio is concentrated in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.

Investment Grade Municipal Trust (IGMT0146)
	
		





Objective
The Investment Grade Municipal Trust, a unit investment trust,  invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income and to preserve capital.*

The Investment Grade Municipal Trust is a diversified portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds that, on the date of deposit, are generally rated at least BBB- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least Baa3 by Moody's.

This investment is similar to other tax-exempt investments, seeking to achieve consistent income, exempt from federal income tax; however it may do so without the cost of insurance. By investing in a portfolio of investment grade bonds (rated BBB- or higher by S&P, or rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's) you may benefit from a higher yielding investment potentially without the added costs of insurance.

Note: Bonds in this trust are generally not covered by insurers for timely payment of principal and interest
* Interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline, and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risks than a more diversified portfolio.
A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several market sectors. This trust is concentrated in the healthcare sector. There are certain risks specific to the healthcare companies such as governmental regulation and the risk that a product may never come to pass.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline, and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risks than a more diversified portfolio.
A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several market sectors. This trust is concentrated in the healthcare sector. There are certain risks specific to the healthcare companies such as governmental regulation and the risk that a product may never come to pass.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline, and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risks than a more diversified portfolio.
A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several market sectors. This trust is concentrated in the healthcare sector. There are certain risks specific to the healthcare companies such as governmental regulation and the risk that a product may never come to pass.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.
