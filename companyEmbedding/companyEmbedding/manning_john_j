Manning, John J Jr
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Manning, John J Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Manning, John J Jr currently holds license 5110 (Architect), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Manning, John J Jr



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Manning, John J Jr



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

               Company: Another Chance Church
Job Details
               Another Chance Church is a Non-Denominational Church located at 214 East Piccadilly Street in Winchester VA. We are the sister congregation of The Church Of The Valley. We are just plain folks who read the Bible and want to put it into practice. We come to Jesus just as we are and without pretense. Our Motto is "pulling together to meet the needs of others" and that is exactly what we do. Needs come in a variety of forms. Some need food, others clothing, and still others will need a place where they can find shelter from the aggravations and disappointments of life. We want to help folks at the point of their need, whatever that need may be. We truly believe that by 'pulling together' we can make a difference! We need your help, because we believe that God has made YOU with a purpose! ALL of the services and assistance we give are FREE - no strings attached! Just how is that done you ask? Well to find out you'll have to come visit us. The bottom line is this: You can make a difference! The way we see it God made you and He knows what He is doing. He loves you and wants you to get the most out of this life. Why else would He have sent His Son to die for your sins? No matter who it is, all have been given a gift by God! We want you to use your gift and help 'pull together' with us as we follow Jesus. It does not matter to us what your background is, or what you have done in the past because with Jesus all things are new. His Love and Mercy provide each of us with Another Chance to follow Him! This Sunday why not give God Another Chance and come visit us just as you are! Our service is far from boring, you might even learn something, or maybe you can teach us a thing or two! We look forward to seeing you there.
