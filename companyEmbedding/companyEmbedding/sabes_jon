An Approach that Works


With over 20 years of experience in law, finance, venture capital, and business development, Jon Sabes is the cofounder and chief executive officer of GWG Holdings, Inc., in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In addition to his successful career, Jon Sabes is an active participant in endurance athletic events, such as Ironman Wisconsin 2013, his third Ironman event. Writing about his participation in Ironman Wisconsin 2013, Mr. Sabes writes about his approach to these types of events: “You have understand that I am an amateur athlete who likes to participate in outdoor endurance events, in other words, it’s a hobby. That means I don’t do not compete for money (I don’t make my living doing this) and my goal is not necessarily to stand on the podium in my age group (although that’s always nice if it were to happen). I am not out there to set a course record, but rather my goal is to be physically and mentally prepared to complete Ironman any day of the week, any month of the year, at a solid weekend warrior pace (as I call it) while being grateful that I can. That is my approach, it’s not for everyone, but it works for me. This approach leads me not to rush through transitions, and smile, acknowledge and thank volunteers and spectators who help me throughout day. This is exactly what I did at Ironman Wisconsin 2013. This approach that always feels good, no matter what my time or physical condition. Being grateful is where I like to be mentally: Grateful for my health and the opportunity to participate. For me, Ironman is all about being who I want to be, both physically and mentally, and actualizing for 12ish hours during the event (some might call it active meditation).”

Basic Facts about Bonds


A finance professional with more than two decades of experience, Jon Sabes serves as chief executive officer of GWG Holdings, Inc., and MedFinance. The founder of both companies, Jon Sabes applies his knowledge of venture capital, financial transactions, law, business development, and structured finance to realize an optimal outcome for the businesses he oversees.Structured finance offers a unique ability to issue debt securities to banks, financial institutions, and individual investors. Debt securities in structured finance possess priority as creditors to specific pools of assets; this status means that they receive payment before shareholders and other creditors. Depending on the type of debt securities an investor holds and the security pledged to support it, some debt holders rank higher in repayment precedence than others.Structured finance techniques generally enable firms to obtain access to more capital at lower interest because they are backed by actual assets or collateral that produce cash flows, or that which can be traded or sold to repay debt holders. These assets represent the opportunity to collect funds from issuers or courts under well established legal constructs. When a corporation issues debt securities using structured finance techniques, the assets and the legal documentation governing the rights to collateral are of primary importance. Using structured finance, a company’s credit rating is not as relevant to the determination of the interest rates as is the collateral as a source of repayment in satisfaction of the debt.

SEC Registration Basics


Jon Sabes holds the position of chief executive officer of Minneapolis-based GWG Holdings, Inc., and of MedFinance, both of which he established nearly 10 years ago, One of the companies, GWG Holdings, Inc., has filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, also known as the truth in securities law. The Securities Act of 1933 strived to provide protection to investors by creating transparency about the financial health of organizations issuing securities. Overseen by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities Act of 1933 requires organizations to disclose crucial financial information upon mandatory registration of securities. Registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission entails reporting descriptions about GWG Holdings, Inc.’s business and property, meticulous details about the securities themselves, independently audited financial statements, and depictions of the company’s management. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission makes all registrations available to potential investors and the public via EDGAR, or the Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system. The system executes automated collections, validation, cataloging, and acceptance of registration data. Although federal regulations require registration for most securities, exemptions include transactions involving private offerings, intrastate offerings, and municipal securities.

Triathlon Hydration Tips


Jon Sabes is co-founder of GWG Holdings, Inc. With over 20 years’ experience in finance, venture capital, law, banking, and more, Jon Sabes has founded a business that provides a valuable service to consumers who own life insurance but no longer can afford their life insurance or no longer have the need for the which the life insurance was purchased. In addition to his career, Sabes is an amature endurance athlete who regularly competes in triathlons.For triathletes, creating a logical hydration and nutrition strategy for race day can mean the difference between success and failure. The level of exertion endurance triathletes experience requires them to replenish their body with vital fluids and nutrients. Experts suggest accomplishing this in a number of ways. -Try fluid replacement drinks. Athletes should test different flavors and brands weeks before the race to ensure it will not upset their stomach. Try to stay away from products whose ingredients you cannot understand. Choose a drink with the right balance of sodium, potassium, and carbohydrate. Tough exercise requires the replenishment of electrolytes for adequate recovery. Not getting enough can spell disaster for the triathlete. -Try real food. Eating real food, as opposed to multicolored gels and chewables is smart. Your body is used to eating real food and can get nutrients from foods that include avacados, apples, oranges, banannas as part of their construction. This year I employed a new technique, something I learned from last year when I went to grab my whole grain, almond butter, avocado sandwich on my bike – it had turned to mush – as well as the bag of whole foods sweet potatoes – but I just squeezed the bag and I ate it like space man food It was yummy and my body liked it and it was easier to consumer in mash form So that is what I do, real food mush bags.In the end, be creative, but try to stay clean with your eating. Eating clean is your bodies best friend when it comes to hydration and nutrition during exercise. Also, experiment with different levels of intake before, during and after exercise. Use the weeks leading up to the race to will help you find the right hydration and nutrition strategy for your body.

Tips for Proper Running Technique


Jon Sabes is a highly experienced executive in the financial industry. With more than 20 years of service, he has worked with a variety of businesses in developing their financing capabilities. Apart from his professional pursuits, Jon Sabes is an avid swimmer, biker, and runner who enjoys endurance athletics. Long distance runners should focus on their form in order to improve their running speed and avoid injury. Two major considerations in proper runner’s form are the arms position and torso activation. The arms should be only swing forward and back in a motion that is parallel with the body and with the elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Many runners mistakenly swim their arms side to side across their torso, which increases stress on the spine and does not add to the forward momentum of running. When the forearms become tense, or fists begin to clench, runners should drop them to the side and shake them out to release all tension. Try focusing on your fingers - pinching them together to create a tension which you can direct your focus towards. The head and shoulders influence the position of the torso. When the head is up and the shoulders are low and loose with the back straight, the runner’s torso position will promote optimal oxygen intake. The lungs will then be free to expand to full capacity. A slight lean forward allows gravity to work in your favor, helping propel you forward through the air. Try focusing on your tail bone - allowing it to slide back and tucking it under to feel the change in your hip position.Proper running technique will ensure maximum performance with minimal injury to the body. When you run, see how long you can focus on aspects of form alone - holding your concentration on form can improve your running and pass the time quickly as the miles go by.

TechnologyOur Secret​Master Plan​Jon Sabes, CEONovember 3, 2016​BackgroundWe started our company in 2006 to create a secondary market life insurance company. This means we invest in life insurance assets by purchasing policies that seniors no longer want, need, or can afford. The secondary life insurance market exists simply because insurance carriers offer grossly inadequate surrender values for the life insurance products they sell. Over time, insurance carriers have grown to rely on the high voluntary consumer lapse and surrender behaviors (even though they don’t publicly admit this) to enhance their profits. And because we eliminate consumers lapsing and surrendering their life insurance, the carriers do not like our business. Conversely, consumers seem to love our business, and you can . . .​Continue Reading the Full Text by Jon Sabesunderstand why when you realize we have paid out more than $379 million directly to policy owners – as compared to the $26.1 million in surrender values offered by insurance carriers for the very same policies.Our business was founded to disrupt the status quo of the life insurance industry. ​New Actuarial Underwriting TechnologyA key to investing in life insurance assets, as well as managing pensions, social security entitlements, annuity liabilities, and several other financial services, is understanding the actuarial mortality profile of individual populations. In our case, the investment returns we derive from our portfolio of life insurance is based primarily on the underlying actuarial results we experience. The goal of the insurance business is to develop predictable actuarial underwriting models to appropriately price and select associated products and risk. The term “actuarial underwriting” is my term, and industry professionals may chafe at my use of it, but for me this term explains the goal of the life insurance business which is to better estimate individual lifespans across large groups of people. The critical function of actuarial underwriting has changed little in more than a century. Historically the life insurance, long-term care, and annuity industries have used “medical evidenced based underwriting” to assess, select and price risk in order to operate their businesses profitably. Medical evidenced based underwriting is exactly what it sounds like – an underwriter reviews an individual’s medical data and family history in order to develop a view of the insured’s health profile for purposes of appropriately pricing the risk associated with the product being sold. Because actuarial underwriting is also key to our business, we began an initiative in 2015 to re-examine the way in which we approached this process. Our initiative included a review of new advanced medical technologies capable of predicting aging and related mortality more accurately. These technologies leveraged new developments in the examination of telomere length, gene expression, and protein expression. Our investigation ultimately led us to the lab of Dr. Steve Horvath, a Professor of Human Genetics and Biostatistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Dr. Horvath is a recognized expert on aging who has focused his research on the root causes of aging that are encoded in the DNA molecule.In 2013, Dr. Horvath reported that human cells have an internal “biological age” and “biological clock” at the DNA molecular level that is indicative of the aging process. The research was hailed as ground-breaking and featured in the scientific journal of ​Nature. The study of chemical modifications to the DNA molecule that reveal aging, among other things, is now a cutting edge science known as epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of how the DNA molecule’s instructions are translated into the production of proteins that make us who we are. In other words, while scientists unraveled the sequence of our DNA molecular code in 2003, in many ways only now are they beginning to understand how that code translates into our individual makeup. Dr. Horvath’s epigenetic research has focused on methylation sites on our DNA (28 million methylation sites on the human DNA molecule) in order to study the genetic and epigenetic determinants of aging and mortality. ​​In 2016, Dr. Horvath reported a discovery. Upon completion of a statistical analysis of over 13,000 individual DNA samples, he was able to identify a specific set of DNA methylation-based bio-markers that could be used to predict individual risk of all-cause mortality. The implications of the discovery are simple and profound: Individual lifespans can now be estimated with significantly greater precision across large groups of people.We are working right now to translate this technology into an actuarial underwriting methodology that we believe will be revolutionary. We expect to immediately begin implementing this technology to enhance our current underwriting processes. And we believe the recently evolved technology of identifying epigenetic bio-markers to forecast actuarial mortality will create a marked leap forward to better assess, select and price risk for the life insurance, long-term care, and annuity businesses. Fintech – Insurtech Opportunity We believe the incumbent industry has no incentive to change. We believe the incumbent industry has little ability to change. We believe the incumbent industry lacks the imagination to reinvent itself from within. We believe the incumbent is vulnerable. We know the $21 trillion life insurance industry provides grossly inadequate surrender values to consumers who own life insurance. We know this because we have lived it for over ten years. In addition, we have learned that the life insurance industry has built a cumbersome underwriting apparatus that makes the process of selling life insurance more challenging than ever, has not evolved its products to address consumer needs, and has not employed advanced technologies to assess, select, and price risk. Industry insiders, observers and professional commentators have been actively writing about the existence of major fintech and insurtech opportunities within the insurance industry. Insurance industry leaders acknowledge that “…advancements such as DNA testing potentially upending the insurer’s ability to assess and select acceptable risks” is a reality. Periodicals and news articles are replete in highlighting the fact that the insurance industry business is ripe for a disruptive fintech reinvention. Industry observers and commentators also suggest that reinvention must come from outside the industry. We believe there is a tremendous opportunity for our disruptive financial services company to reinvent the life insurance industry using our predictive bio-marker technology. We believe our technology has the potential to upend a century of entrenched incumbent practices in the life insurance businesses. In addition, we believe our technology may open new markets where traditional medical evidenced based underwriting is either impractical or impossible. ConclusionSo what are we doing about it? Our team does not consist of traditional life insurance industry professionals. Rather, our team consists of financial entrepreneurs who have been working on the backend of the life insurance industry. Along the way, we have asked simple questions about complex industry problems and searched for innovative solutions to address the problems we encounter and the opportunities we perceive. Since inception, our business has been, and always will be, a disruptive outsider to the life insurance industry. Today, we are seeking to provide consumers additional value for their life insurance by upsetting the status quo of high policy lapse rates and low surrender values enjoyed by life insurance carriers for years. And now, with the announcement that we are exercising our option to exclusively license “DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality ” technology from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), we have acquired technology that will not only make us smarter in our current business, but also gives us the opportunity to effect an elegant paradigm shift in actuarial underwriting methodology. ​We believe our corporate lineage is fitting, as it was the very existence of the life insurance secondary market that drove Elizur Wright, the “father of life insurance” to reinvent what we know as the modern day life insurance industry by establishing regulations that require insurance carriers to provide surrender values to consumers – and it’s the secondary market that will once again, drive another reinvention of the industry, and this time the reinvention will come from technology and market forces. Seeking to capitalize on the fintech – insurtech opportunity is the next logical step for our corporate story, values, and mission as we are uniquely situated to creatively disrupt and reinvent the life insurance industry.So our secret master plan is as follows:​First, we are going to use technology to greatly improve our current business; Second, we are going to use technology to enter the primary markets of the life insurance business; Third, we are going to use technology to expand all aspects of the life insurance, long-term care, and annuity businesses; andFourth, we are going to rewrite century-old, outdated practices and provide consumers with new value-added insurance products that meet their modern day needs. Please don’t tell anyone our plan.p.s. I am publishing our Secret Master Plan in homage to Elon Musk and his 2006 post of The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan. Musk’s bold, transparent, entrepreneurial vision coupled with his initiative to take action is inspiring to any entrepreneur seeking to do the same!

Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQs about the technology and how GWG may integrate it into its business:What is the licensing agreement GWG announced November 3, 2016?  We announced that we have exercised an option to license DNA technology from UCLA that was invented by one of UCLA’s professors, the leading expert on DNA technology and the aging of human cells. Our license is exclusive and we feel this puts us ahead of the rest of the industry in working to apply this technology to the insurance industry.What is this technology? It’s called “DNA Methylation” and it is the mechanism that records the “biological age” progression of human cells which is independent from “chronological age” progression. In 2016, Dr. Horvath reported a discovery. Upon completion of a statistical analysis of over 13,000 individual DNA samples, he was able to identify a specific set of DNA methylation-based bio-markers that could be used to predict individual risk of all-cause mortality. The implications of the discovery are simple and profound: Individual lifespans can now be estimated with significantly greater precision across large groups of individuals. How will it be used and how will it affect GWG’s current business?We are working to find ways to integrate aspects of this technology into our underwriting protocols to help us make better decisions about the life insurance policies we purchase. We will keep you posted on how we are using this technology in our business as well as any other opportunities we identify for its use.What is your motivation for doing this? As a leader in the life insurance secondary market for more than ten years, we have had a front row seat to how the key parts of this industry operate. We believe these new technologies present the potential to upend a century of entrenched incumbent practices in the life insurance, long-term care, and annuity businesses.Will this mean that GWG will change the process it uses for purchasing life insurance policies on the secondary market? We believe it has the potential to lead to changes in our process, but we are still working on what exactly that will mean.When do you think you will implement this technology into your current business? ​ We are just beginning the work of determining how to use the technology in our business. We will keep you posted on the progress we make and any new methods we develop.How is this technology different from the home DNA tests I see online? Think of it this way, comparing DNA Methylation to home DNA tests is like comparing a team of major leaguers to a little league team. They use the same basic rules and the final score might look the same, but a major league team has skills little leaguers are a decade away from approaching. Who is involved in this project? We have assembled a team of professionals from all aspects of genetic research, life insurance, actuarial and other disciplines. This team is asking simple questions about complex industry problems and searching for elegant solutions to address the opportunities we uncover and the inevitable roadblocks we may face.

The Economist: The World’s Most Valuable Commodity is Now Data

Posted by JSABES | May 15, 2017 | Life Insurance, Technology & Aging | 0  | 








 


From The Economist:
“A new commodity spawns a lucrative, fast-growing industry, prompting antitrust regulators to step in to restrain those who control its flow. A century ago, the resource in question was oil. Now similar concerns are being raised by the giants that deal in data, the oil of the digital era. These titans—Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—look unstoppable. They are the five most valuable listed firms in the world. Their profits are surging: they collectively racked up over $25bn in net profit in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon captures half of all dollars spent online in America. Google and Facebook accounted for almost all the revenue growth in digital advertising in America last year.
“Such dominance has prompted calls for the tech giants to be broken up, as Standard Oil was in the early 20th century. This newspaper has argued against such drastic action in the past. Size alone is not a crime. The giants’ success has benefited consumers. Few want to live without Google’s search engine, Amazon’s one-day delivery or Facebook’s newsfeed. Nor do these firms raise the alarm when standard antitrust tests are applied. Far from gouging consumers, many of their services are free (users pay, in effect, by handing over yet more data). Take account of offline rivals, and their market shares look less worrying. And the emergence of upstarts like Snapchat suggests that new entrants can still make waves.
“But there is cause for concern. Internet companies’ control of data gives them enormous power. Old ways of thinking about competition, devised in the era of oil, look outdated in what has come to be called the “data economy” (see Briefing). A new approach is needed.
“What has changed? Smartphones and the internet have made data abundant, ubiquitous and far more valuable. Whether you are going for a run, watching TV or even just sitting in traffic, virtually every activity creates a digital trace—more raw material for the data distilleries. As devices from watches to cars connect to the internet, the volume is increasing: some estimate that a self-driving car will generate 100 gigabytes per second. Meanwhile, artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning extract more value from data. Algorithms can predict when a customer is ready to buy, a jet-engine needs servicing or a person is at risk of a disease. Industrial giants such as GE and Siemens now sell themselves as data firms.
This abundance of data changes the nature of competition. Technology giants have always benefited from network effects: the more users Facebook signs up, the more attractive signing up becomes for others. With data there are extra network effects. By collecting more data, a firm has more scope to improve its products, which attracts more users, generating even more data, and so on. The more data Tesla gathers from its self-driving cars, the better it can make them at driving themselves—part of the reason the firm, which sold only 25,000 cars in the first quarter, is now worth more than GM, which sold 2.3m. Vast pools of data can thus act as protective moats.”
