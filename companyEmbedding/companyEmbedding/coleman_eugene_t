Learn More About Coleman® Lanterns & Lighting 
Light the way through just about any situation with Coleman® lanterns and lights. 
Trust your lighting to one of the most iconic names in outdoor goods. Coleman® lighting is great for hikes, camping trips, family picnics or emergency situations. Expect bright, reliable and consistent light for whatever your outing has in store. 
The lighting collection from Coleman® includes propane or kerosene lanterns, headlamps, LED lights, spotlights and much more. Looking for something else? Shop the entire collection of headlamps, flashlights and lanterns at DICK'S Sporting Goods. 

Expert Advice

Coleman® lanterns help maintain lighting in a variety of settings, particularly at your campsite. You can select between a variety of fuel types for the lantern that’s right for you. 

Propane lanterns are a popular choice—they’re easy to use, light to carry and highly reliable. Note that they do not perform well in freezing temperatures. 
Kerosene is economical and dependable, though many campers find it has a strong smell and can give off smoke. 
Dual-fuel lanterns use a combination of butane and propane. These appliances are lightweight and simple to use, though fluctuations in temperature can impact usage. 
LED lanterns are rechargeable and give off great light. Plus, LED never needs to be replaced, so your lantern is ready to go season after season. 

In addition to lanterns, Coleman® offers headlamps, spotlights and much more. 
Headlamps are a lightweight, compact way to provide hands-free light on the go. Always consult product information for details on your product’s usage. For example, lumens indicate how intensely light glows at its source. This factor indicates the power of your light. Also, think about factors including beam distance, battery life and the size and weight of your headlamp.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them. And if you ever want a place to discuss your passions, your knowledge, or your warnings about products, our forum is one of the more comprehensive places to do it.

So don’t take our word for it, check it out for yourself and see everything eReplacementParts.com has to offer.

						What Our Loyal Customers Have To Say					

						Just a short note to say thanks for the information and parts you provide. I have been able to resurrect and maintain a wide variety of tools thanks to the schematics and amazing array of parts you can supply.					

						Chris D.					

						Maryland, USA					


					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.

Expert Advice

Choose a headlamp with a lightweight, compact design and features that offer utility on your hike. An adjustable headband and simple push-button switch ensures that using your device is a snap. Think about these factors when selecting your headlamp: 

Lumens indicate how intensely a light glows at its source, providing insight into the power of your light. Also keep in mind factors including beam distance, battery life and the size and weight of your device
Beam distance is often reported in meters, measuring how far the device illuminates with new batteries
Run time is reported in hours, calculating run time until the lights can no longer produce usable light

Some headlamps offer a fixed beam width, while others offer adjustable widths. Flood and wide beams are useful for a variety of outdoor tasks. This beam mode does not project light a long distance, rather, it focuses light on a specific area. Narrow spot beams enable long-distance viewing—a valuable factor for hikers navigating long, dark trails. 
Many headlamps come with a variety of high and low-light modes, including flashing strobe lights, boost or high beams and standard low-light. Using an “economic mode” enables you to preserve battery life.

Find Your Grill Model Number


			You may have to do a fair amount of searching to find your grill model number. Different manufacturers place them in very different places. You can always check your owner’s manual if you still have it kicking around. Otherwise, check inside the doors, on the frame--especially the lower frame. You may see the model number stamped into a metal portion of the game, or you may also see a sticker that will clearly label the information you need. Once you find that number you can get started ordering parts or accessories for your grill.

If you still can’t find your model number, give us a call. We can help you find it, no matter what model grill you use. Then we’ll help you get the parts you need and can even offer advice on your repair.

					About eReplacementParts 				


					eReplacementParts, located in Sandy, Utah just outside of Salt Lake, began from modest beginnings. The company’s two owners originally sold power tool parts from an apartment filled floor to ceiling with shipping boxes. Soon after they moved into a warehouse space and expanded their offerings to include lawn equipment parts, too.

A few years later they added grill parts to their rapidly growing inventory. Now we stock parts for dozens of grill brands, including Coleman, Blu-Ember, Char-Broil, and many many more.

A good camping trip is perfected, and disappointment is kept at bay, when campers are prepared for the conditions they might face once they reach their campsite and important pieces of equipment are included in the camping gear. This way, everyone can enjoy the pristine surroundings and camaraderie that's the essence of camping. Make sure you have all the gear you need for your next camping trip by making a stop first at Walmart, where you can save money on the necessary supplies because of our Every Day Low Prices.tents and accessoriesProbably the most important piece of camping gear is the tent. Having the right size is just the beginning. It should also be designed to suit your needs. Most tents are dome style and suitable for one to four people, although they can hold up to 12 or more. Most tents don't have much headroom, but the ones on the larger end are big enough to stand up in. For a more communal effect, some tents can be connected, making them ideal for families camping together, but still affording some privacy. For easy setup and takedown of your tent, accessories that are good to have on hand include tent pegs, a rubber mallet or hammer and a stake puller. To keep the tent tidy, have a small broom and dustpan handy. A tent pole replacement kit may be necessary, especially if you have an older tent, and a battery-powered fan can keep everyone in the tent cool on warm nights.Sleeping gearA sleeping bag is the most versatile sleeping item you can bring with you on a camping trip. They keep you warm when it's cold, can zip up almost completely if you're being bothered by pests and some even have liners that are removable to allow you to keep warm or stay cooler, depending on the temperature. sleeping bags are chosen based on length, so someone who's 5-feet tall or less can feel comfortable sleeping in a properly sized bag and someone who's more than 6-feet tall can use a sleeping bag that's the ideal size as well. Sleeping bags are also rated by temperature, with many specifically designed to be comfortable in temperatures of between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, while others keep you warm even if the temperature drops to 0 degrees F.If sleeping on the ground isn't what you had in mind, you can also choose to sleep on a cot, hammock, sleeping pad, mat or even an air bed. Air beds range between bed sizes of twin and king and have varying levels of thickness. Bring along an air pump, and you can save your breath by pumping with your feet or an air compressor instead. When camping, you can even combine sleeping items, such as sleeping on a pad in your sleeping bag.Cooking equipmentWhile camping, you're sure to get hungry, and few things are better when camping than hot grub. Whether you're eating what you caught or items that you brought with you, such as in a cooler, having a portable grill or stove and the right cookware and utensils can make all the difference in the world. Portable grills can be small and work close to the ground or be on a waist-level stand, making them easier to use. You have the choice of liquid propane gas or charcoal as the heat source for your grill, so having extra canisters of propane or a couple bags of charcoal, lighter fluid, matches or lighters and even some wood chips makes for a terrific plan.You'll also want to have some cookware. Cast iron, such as a skillet and a Dutch oven, allows you to cook many things, even if you're only using a campfire. A spatula, tongs, long grill fork, grill brush and some skewers cover most of the cooking you'll be doing. Having some camping plates and utensils, or disposable if you prefer, ensures everyone gets a chance to eat.Other camping gearAlthough these are the basic supplies you need when camping, there are some other essentials you should have handy. You'll need some additional light for when the sun sets, so flashlights or lanterns are a necessity. Lanterns can run on kerosene, citronella or battery power. If you're going to be walking in the dark, such as when nature calls, a battery powered headlamp lights the way for you. For added comfort, portable chairs and chaise lounges are ideal for sitting around the fire or relaxing alongside the lake or river. There are even folding tables that you can use for meals or playing games. it's a good idea to have a knife, so that you can cut things like rope or fillet fish, or a multitool in case you need to make emergency repairs. Other accessories you may want to consider to ensure a fun trip include a folding shovel, extra water jugs, tarp, weather radio and even a portable toilet or shower.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332926, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

	Our current catalog is thick with recently introduced products that make spending time outside a pleasure. There are products just for kids. Coolers that keep food and drinks cold for up to five days. Powerful, portable, propane grills that you can take anywhere or just use in your backyard. An accessory line with more than 100 separate items. See www.coleman.com for links to our websites around the world.

	As an international leader in the innovation and marketing of outdoor products, The Coleman Company, Inc. helps people have fun and make memories by providing the gear integral to their favorite outdoor experiences. The company’s products include its legendary lanterns and stoves, as well as coolers, tents, sleeping bags, airbeds, backpacks, furniture, and grills under the Coleman® brand. Additionally, the company provides flotation devices, towables, rainwear, waders, hunting and fishing gear as well as safety and survival equipment under its Stearns®, Sevylor®, Sospenders®, Hodgman®, Mad Dog Gear®, Helium® and Aerobed® brands. Founded in 1900 and based in Wichita, Kansas, Coleman is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jarden Corporation and can be found online at www.coleman.com.
