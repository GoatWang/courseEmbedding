Russell Investments proxy voting information

Background
On October 8, 2015, London Stock Exchange Group plc (LSEG) announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the investment management business of Russell Investments (including Russell Investment Management Company (RIMCo)) to a newly-formed acquisition vehicle through which limited partners of certain private equity funds affiliated with TA Associates Management, L.P. (TA Associates), one of the oldest and most experienced global growth-oriented private equity firms, will indirectly acquire a majority ownership interest in Russell Investments. In addition, Reverence Capital Partners, L.P. (Reverence Capital), a private investment firm focused on investing in leading financial services companies, has partnered with TA Associates and limited partners of certain private equity funds affiliated with Reverence Capital will indirectly acquire a significant minority ownership interest in Russell Investments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016.
Fund shareholders and policy owners will receive proxy statements
As a result of the change of control of RIMCo resulting from the transaction, the current investment advisory agreement between each Fund of Russell Investment Company (RIC) and Russell Investment Funds (RIF), respectively, and RIMCo, each Fund’s current investment adviser, will terminate. Policy owners and most shareholders will receive a proxy statement asking them to approve a new investment advisory agreement that allows RIMCo (or a limited liability company successor to RIMCo) to continue to serve as investment adviser to each Fund for which such policy owner or shareholder is a holder of record as of January 19, 2016 for RIF and February 22, 2016 for RIC following the transaction.
Shareholders and policy owners with multiple Funds will receive one proxy statement and a proxy card or voting instruction card for each Fund held or in which they have a beneficial interest as of January 19, 2016 (RIF) and February 22, 2016 (RIC).
PROXY VOTING INFORMATION
Shareholders and policy owners can vote their shares by:

Mail:  Sign, date, and complete the reverse side of the proxy card(s) or voting instruction card(s) and return in the postage-paid envelope provided.
Internet:  Log on to the website address located on the proxy card(s) or voting instruction card(s).  The control number found on the proxy card(s) or voting instruction card(s) is needed to vote by internet.

History[edit]

1936 — Local businessman Frank Russell starts a small brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington.
1958 — George Russell joins his grandfather's firm, Frank Russell Company. Six months later, George becomes chairman, president and CEO when his grandfather dies. The company has two employees — George and an assistant.
1974 — Russell's institutional consulting business grows from a single client to 40 major U.S. clients, including AT&T and General Motors.
1979 — Russell initiates its global presence with the opening of an office in London.
1980 — Russell launches its investment management business in response to a client's request for funds that provide a fully diversified and packaged blend of investment managers. Russell begins leveraging its research of outside managers[clarification needed] to create a manager-of-managers investment process for smaller retirement plans and individuals.
1984 — Russell researchers create the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, and Russell 3000 Indexes as benchmarks for evaluating manager performance. Russell opens an office in Toronto, Ontario.
1986 — Russell opens an office in Tokyo, Japan and opens an office in Sydney, Australia.
1988 — Russell dedicates a new headquarters building in Tacoma, Wash.
1990 — Mike Phillips is named president of Frank Russell Company. In 1993, he is named chief executive officer. George Russell continues as chairman. George Russell establishes Russell 20-20, a group of independent money managers and plan sponsors who explore emerging markets with an eye toward investment opportunities.
1999 — Russell expands to Singapore. Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the United States, acquires Russell. The company retains the Russell name, management, office locations and investment approach.
2002 — George Russell retires, retaining the role of chairman emeritus for Frank Russell Company and Russell 20-20.
2003 — Russell changes its business name to Russell Investment Group. Craig Ueland is appointed president of Russell in July 2003 and then CEO effective January 2004.
2004 — In March, Russell acquires Pantheon Ventures, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London. In August, Russell acquires the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin.
2007 — Russell's family of U.S. equity indexes goes global with the launch of a family of global stock indexes. Russell opens an office in Seoul, Korea.
2008 — Russell investments announced that they might leave Tacoma, having outgrown their old headquarters. The lease on the headquarters on A Street expires in 2013. Local government officials, wary of losing the biggest company in downtown Tacoma, have started an attractive campaign to keep Russell in Tacoma, including plans for a brand new headquarters.[5][6]




FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD. Investors were already gated and redemptions reported to be high. Many staff in the Alternatives Division were laid off, with the few remaining persons employed to oversee the wind-down process of the above.




2009 — ::Russell’s Board of Directors named Andrew Doman as Russell’s new Chief Executive Officer. Andrew Doman assumed role of President upon John Schlifske's return to Northwestern Mutual. :: Russell Investments said they would move headquarters from Tacoma to Chase Center in Seattle.

2011 — ::Russell's Board of Directors named Len Brennan as Russell's new Chief Executive Officer. He is also chief executive of the firm's Europe, Middle East, Africa business. ::Russell Investments opens its first regional office in Germany with the launch of Frankfurt operations during October.
2014 — Northwestern Mutual sells Russell Investments to London Stock Exchange Group for $2.7 billion.
2015 — LSEG separates Russell's Index business from the consulting, asset management and consulting business by forming "FTSE Russell" brand[7]
2016 — London Stock Exchange Group completes[8] sale of Russell Investments to TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners for $1.15 billion. LSEG kept the indexes side of the business as FTSE Russell.
2017 — Willis Towers Watson signs a definitive agreement to acquire its stand-alone Australian actuarial business for an undisclosed sum.[9]

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

History[edit]

1936 — Local businessman Frank Russell starts a small brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington.
1958 — George Russell joins his grandfather's firm, Frank Russell Company. Six months later, George becomes chairman, president and CEO when his grandfather dies. The company has two employees — George and an assistant.
1974 — Russell's institutional consulting business grows from a single client to 40 major U.S. clients, including AT&T and General Motors.
1979 — Russell initiates its global presence with the opening of an office in London.
1980 — Russell launches its investment management business in response to a client's request for funds that provide a fully diversified and packaged blend of investment managers. Russell begins leveraging its research of outside managers[clarification needed] to create a manager-of-managers investment process for smaller retirement plans and individuals.
1984 — Russell researchers create the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, and Russell 3000 Indexes as benchmarks for evaluating manager performance. Russell opens an office in Toronto, Ontario.
1986 — Russell opens an office in Tokyo, Japan and opens an office in Sydney, Australia.
1988 — Russell dedicates a new headquarters building in Tacoma, Wash.
1990 — Mike Phillips is named president of Frank Russell Company. In 1993, he is named chief executive officer. George Russell continues as chairman. George Russell establishes Russell 20-20, a group of independent money managers and plan sponsors who explore emerging markets with an eye toward investment opportunities.
1999 — Russell expands to Singapore. Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the United States, acquires Russell. The company retains the Russell name, management, office locations and investment approach.
2002 — George Russell retires, retaining the role of chairman emeritus for Frank Russell Company and Russell 20-20.
2003 — Russell changes its business name to Russell Investment Group. Craig Ueland is appointed president of Russell in July 2003 and then CEO effective January 2004.
2004 — In March, Russell acquires Pantheon Ventures, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London. In August, Russell acquires the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin.
2007 — Russell's family of U.S. equity indexes goes global with the launch of a family of global stock indexes. Russell opens an office in Seoul, Korea.
2008 — Russell investments announced that they might leave Tacoma, having outgrown their old headquarters. The lease on the headquarters on A Street expires in 2013. Local government officials, wary of losing the biggest company in downtown Tacoma, have started an attractive campaign to keep Russell in Tacoma, including plans for a brand new headquarters.[5][6]




FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD. Investors were already gated and redemptions reported to be high. Many staff in the Alternatives Division were laid off, with the few remaining persons employed to oversee the wind-down process of the above.




2009 — ::Russell’s Board of Directors named Andrew Doman as Russell’s new Chief Executive Officer. Andrew Doman assumed role of President upon John Schlifske's return to Northwestern Mutual. :: Russell Investments said they would move headquarters from Tacoma to Chase Center in Seattle.
2010 — Russell Investments completes move of headquarters to Seattle. The former Chase Center building is now renamed Russell Investments Center.
2011 — ::Russell's Board of Directors named Len Brennan as Russell's new Chief Executive Officer. He is also chief executive of the firm's Europe, Middle East, Africa business. ::Russell Investments opens its first regional office in Germany with the launch of Frankfurt operations during October.
2014 — Northwestern Mutual sells Russell Investments to London Stock Exchange Group for $2.7 billion.
2015 — LSEG separates Russell's Index business from the consulting, asset management and consulting business by forming "FTSE Russell" brand[7]
2016 — London Stock Exchange Group completes[8] sale of Russell Investments to TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners for $1.15 billion. LSEG kept the indexes side of the business as FTSE Russell.
2017 — Willis Towers Watson signs a definitive agreement to acquire its stand-alone Australian actuarial business for an undisclosed sum.[9]

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

Rebalancing involves periodically buying and selling the stocks, bonds, cash, or other investments in your portfolio to maintain your original or desired mix of those assets.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Layer opened.Expense ratio







A mutual fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets. It's calculated annually and removed from the fund's earnings before they're distributed to investors, directly reducing investors' returns.An expense ratio includes management, administrative, marketing, and distribution fees. It doesn't include loads or purchase or redemption fees.

footnote*Vanguard average mutual fund expense ratio: 0.12%. Industry average expense ratio: 0.69%. All averages are asset-weighted. Industry averages exclude Vanguard. Sources: Vanguard and Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2016.
footnote**For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 9 of 9 Vanguard money market funds, 51 of 54 Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds, and 99 of 107 Vanguard stock funds—for a total of 182 of 193 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer-group average. Results will vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds with a minimum 10-year history were included in the comparison. Source: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company. The competitive performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. View fund performance
footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Beginning July 1, 2015 until November 3, 2015, the front-end sales charge was not reflected in the returns for the Russell Multi-Strategy Income Fund Class A shares. As a result, performance for Class A Shares of this Fund was overstated on Russell Investment's website and in performance reports from July 1, 2015 through November 3, 2015. Performance on the website and in performance reports has been corrected.
From the Fund’s inception until August 11, 2016, the performance for the Tax Exempt High Yield Bond Fund Class A shares was calculated using an incorrect front-end sales charge of 5.75% rather than the correct front-end sales charge of 3.75%. As a result, the Fund’s performance during this time period was understated on Russell Investments’ websites. The performance was corrected on August 12, 2016.

Notice:
Effective September 22, 2017, Class A1 Shares will be redesignated as Class T Shares.Effective September 15th, 2017, Class T Shares will be redesignated as Class M Shares.Effective September 15, 2017, the Select U.S. Equity Fund will be renamed the Multifactor U.S. Equity Fund and the Select International Equity Fund will be renamed the Multifactor International Equity Fund.Effective August 18th, 2017, Class I Shares will be reclassified as Class S Shares.
Effective March 1, 2017 Class I Shares are no longer offered to new shareholders of a Fund and may only be purchased by existing Class I shareholders in a Fund.Effective July 26, 2016, the Russell Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund was liquidated.
Beginning July 1, 2015 until November 3, 2015, the front-end sales charge was not reflected in the returns for the Russell Multi-Strategy Income Fund Class A shares. As a result, performance for Class A Shares of this Fund was overstated on Russell Investment's website and in performance reports from July 1, 2015 through November 3, 2015. Performance on the website and in performance reports has been corrected.
From the Fund’s inception until August 11, 2016, the performance for the Tax Exempt High Yield Bond Fund Class A shares was calculated using an incorrect front-end sales charge of 5.75% rather than the correct front-end sales charge of 3.75%. As a result, the Fund’s performance during this time period was understated on Russell Investments’ websites. The performance was corrected on August 12, 2016.

Important Sales Charge Information for LifePoints® Funds, Target Portfolio Series & Target Date Series















*Tax Disclosures:
Pre-Liquidation After Tax Returns: Returns after taxes on distributions may be the same as returns before taxes for the same period if there were no distributions for that period. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and the 3.8% Medicare surtax, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.
Post-Liquidation After Tax Returns: After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and the 3.8% Medicare surtax, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. If the Fund has realized capital losses, the return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares may be higher than the return before taxes and the return after taxes on distributions. The calculation of return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares assumes that a shareholder has sufficient capital gains of the same character to offset any capital losses on a sale of fund shares and that the shareholder may therefore deduct the entire capital loss.
∮Yield Disclosures:

Yield: The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return of the fund; yields will vary.
Unsubsidized: The yield shown is what the yield would have been without the current fee waivers and expense reimbursements (unsubsidized).

‡The tax equivalent yield is based on a tax rate of 43.4%, which includes the 3.8% Medicare surtax.
The SEC Yield represents annualized net investment income (dividends and interest, after the deduction of the fund's expenses) earned by a fund over a 30-day period, expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets. It is calculated based on the standardized formula set forth by the SEC. Net investment income is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks). The SEC Yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income, and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate.

The distribution yield of a fund is the sum of the trailing 12 months of income distributions divided by its current net asset value, adjusted upward for any capital gains distributed over the same time period. The frequency of distributions vary by fund.

Please note: Since the SEC yield and distribution yield cover different time frames, the two methods usually produce different yields. For example, in a falling interest-rate environment, a fund's 12-month distribution yield is likely to be higher than its 30-day SEC yield, since the annual figure includes income earned during the prior months when rates were higher. Click here for more information on income distribution yields.

The tax equivalent yield is the pre-tax yield required from a taxable bond in order to equal the tax-free yield of a municipal bond. Tax equivalent yield is calculated by dividing the after-tax yield (30 day SEC yield) by the difference obtained from subtracting the applicable tax rate from 1. For example, for an investor who pays taxes at a rate of 43.4%, an after-tax yield of 2% has a tax-equivalent yield of 0.02/(1 - 0.434), or 3.53%.
ЖFund Level Statistics Disclosures:

Weighted Average Duration: Approximates the percentage change in the price of a bond or the value of a portfolio of bonds for every one percentage point shift in interest rates.
Weighted Average Maturity: The weighted average of the remaining terms to maturity of bonds held by the Fund.
3 year beta: A measurement of the Fund's sensitivity to market changes using the fund's benchmark (as stated in the prospectus) as an approximation of the market; beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the market; beta less than 1 is less volatile than the market.

Fund  objectives, risks, charges and expenses should be carefully considered  before investing. A summary prospectus, if available, or a prospectus containing this and other important  information can be obtained by calling 800-787-7354 or by visiting the prospectus and reports page to download one. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Please remember that all investments carry some level of risk, including the potential loss of principal invested. They do not typically grow at an even rate of return and may experience negative growth. As with any type of portfolio structuring, attempting to reduce risk and increase return could, at certain times, unintentionally reduce returns.
Diversification and multi-asset solutions do not assure a profit and do not protect against loss in declining markets.

Performance information is historical and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that redeemed shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Current to the most recent month-end performance for Russell Investment Company mutual funds is available by visiting: https://russellinvestments.com/us/funds/performance-prices




Performance is calculated based on the SEC standardized method. Performance is reported net of shareholder services fees and fund advisory and administrative fees and gross of financial intermediary fees, which can be obtained from the financial intermediary upon request.




*Tax Disclosures:
Pre-Liquidation After Tax Returns: Returns after taxes on distributions may be the same as returns before taxes for the same period if there were no distributions for that period. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and the 3.8% Medicare surtax, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.
Post-Liquidation After Tax Returns: After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and the 3.8% Medicare surtax, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. If the Fund has realized capital losses, the return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares may be higher than the return before taxes and the return after taxes on distributions. The calculation of return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares assumes that a shareholder has sufficient capital gains of the same character to offset any capital losses on a sale of fund shares and that the shareholder may therefore deduct the entire capital loss.
∮Yield Disclosures:

Yield: The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return of the fund; yields will vary.
Unsubsidized: The yield shown is what the yield would have been without the current fee waivers and expense reimbursements (unsubsidized).

‡The tax equivalent yield is based on a tax rate of 43.4%, which includes the 3.8% Medicare surtax.
The SEC Yield represents annualized net investment income (dividends and interest, after the deduction of the fund's expenses) earned by a fund over a 30-day period, expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets. It is calculated based on the standardized formula set forth by the SEC. Net investment income is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks). The SEC Yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income, and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate.

The distribution yield of a fund is the sum of the trailing 12 months of income distributions divided by its current net asset value, adjusted upward for any capital gains distributed over the same time period. The frequency of distributions vary by fund.

Please note: Since the SEC yield and distribution yield cover different time frames, the two methods usually produce different yields. For example, in a falling interest-rate environment, a fund's 12-month distribution yield is likely to be higher than its 30-day SEC yield, since the annual figure includes income earned during the prior months when rates were higher. Click here for more information on income distribution yields.

The tax equivalent yield is the pre-tax yield required from a taxable bond in order to equal the tax-free yield of a municipal bond. Tax equivalent yield is calculated by dividing the after-tax yield (30 day SEC yield) by the difference obtained from subtracting the applicable tax rate from 1. For example, for an investor who pays taxes at a rate of 43.4%, an after-tax yield of 2% has a tax-equivalent yield of 0.02/(1 - 0.434), or 3.53%.
ЖFund Level Statistics Disclosures:

Weighted Average Duration: Approximates the percentage change in the price of a bond or the value of a portfolio of bonds for every one percentage point shift in interest rates.
Weighted Average Maturity: The weighted average of the remaining terms to maturity of bonds held by the Fund.
3 year beta: A measurement of the Fund's sensitivity to market changes using the fund's benchmark (as stated in the prospectus) as an approximation of the market; beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the market; beta less than 1 is less volatile than the market.
