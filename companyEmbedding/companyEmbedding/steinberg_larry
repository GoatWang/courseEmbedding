For The Love of Music
Invitations to Listening
Michael Steinberg and Larry Rothe

Two noted writers on classical music, Michael Steinberg and Larry Rothe, explore the allure of this melodious art--not in the clinical terms of social scientists--but through stories drawn from their own experience. Steinberg and Rothe draw on a lifetime of listening to, living with, and writing about music, sharing the delights and revelatory encounters they have had with Mozart, Brahms, Stravinsky, and a host of other great (and almost-great) composers. At once highly personal and immediately accessible, their writings shed light on those who make music and those who listen to it.







For The Love of Music
Invitations to Listening
Michael Steinberg and Larry Rothe



Description



The power of music, the way it works on the mind and heart, remains an enticing mystery. Now two noted writers on classical music, Michael Steinberg and Larry Rothe, explore the allure of this melodious art--not in the clinical terms of social scientists--but through stories drawn from their own experience. In For the Love of Music, Steinberg and Rothe draw on a lifetime of listening to, living with, and writing about music, sharing the delights and revelatory encounters they have had with Mozart, Brahms, Stravinsky, and a host of other great (and almost-great) composers. At once highly personal and immediately accessible, their writings shed light on those who make music and those who listen to it--drawing readers into the beautiful and dangerous terrain that has meant so much to the authors. In recounting how they themselves came to love music, Steinberg and Rothe offer keys for listening. You will meet the man who created the sound of Hollywood's Golden Age and you will learn how composers have addressed issues as contemporary as AIDS and the terrorist attacks of September 11.

He is also a former member of the Board of Trustees of the Beverly Hills Bar Association, the Executive Committee of the Entertainment Law, and the Intellectual Property Section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association.
Mr. Steinberg is AV Preeminent rated by Martindale Hubbell and has been selected as a Top Rated Lawyer in the area of Commercial Litigation by American Lawyer Media in conjunction with Martindale Hubbell. He has also been selected by Super Lawyer Magazine as one of Southern California’s Super Lawyers since 2007. Mr. Steinberg has been elected into the Chancery Club of Los Angeles, an organization whose membership is composed of distinguished lawyers who are active in professional, civic, and philanthropic organizations.
