Physical Inventory to Fixed Asset Ledger Reconciliation



 
 








Fixed Asset LedgerReconciliations












Fixed Asset Ledger Reconciliations

Asset Services provides data reconciliation where the physical inventory data is reconciled against the clients current asset inventory listing. 
				Data reconciliation is performed using two-tier methodology.

Tier I Reconciliation

Tier I reconciliation is an automated process in which items are matched by a unique identifier. 
				Items are first matched by an existing asset tag number, and then the asset serial number as the second matching criteria. 

Tier II Reconciliation

Tier II reconciliation is performed if an additional reconciliation of assets is necessary after the completion of the Tier I reconciliation. 
				A Tier II reconciliation involves a line-by-line comparison of the current asset lists to the physical inventory results in an attempt to identify assets as unique items.

The reconciliation professionals at Asset Services first review the existing asset ledger. From there, the ledger line items are categorized into the following areas:
				


Infrastructure (land, buildings & improvements)
Assets unable to be tagged (software & component hardware)
Questionable ledger entries (Equipment for John)
Non-inventoried assets (items costing less than the capitalization threshold


Asset Services provides the ledger analysis reports and reconciliation reports in Excel or comma delimited format for further analysis 
				or to import into the clients existing asset management system.

Leadership Team







Kyle Green

					Founder and CEO
kyle.green@healthcareassetnetwork.com





					I'm passionate about making a difference.  Most of my career has been spent working with amazing people in hospitals around the world.  Early in my career I was an Administrative Resident at University of Kentucky Healthcare and an Administrative Fellow at Johns Hopkins Medicine, then worked with an incredible team to open the first international standards hospital in Shanghai, China while working for Johns Hopkins International.  I've also been a Vice President of Operations at Kosair Children's Hospital, then the Pediatric Service Line, at Norton Healthcare in Kentucky - one of the foremost leaders in healthcare quality (NQF National Quality Healthcare Award in 2011) in the United States.  Most recently I was SVP of Clinical Operations, then Chief Strategy Officer at a terrific, growing children's hospital - Phoenix Children's Hospital.  Connect with me on LinkedIn.
				










Andrew McCloy

					Co-founder and CIO
andrew.mccloy@healthcareassetnetwork.com





					I have been involved with improving operational efficiencies and lowering healthcare costs for over 15 years. As an analyst fresh out of graduate school, I was tasked with identifying cost overages and developing solutions by developing a data analysis and modeling tool for Intermountain Healthcare. From there, I formed a company that specialized in developing inventory management and ERP solutions specific to the healthcare industry. Our software solutions manage inventory and procurement for distributors and non-profits - and everything in between. In addition, I have spent over a decade working with a large Private Equity firm specializing in healthcare to act as an interim Technology Officer for their portfolio companies.

robert.brown@healthcareassetnetwork.com





					For the past 20 years, I have helped launch companies from napkin-ideas to multi-million dollars in revenue. I have also helped them retool their products to meet the needs of newly-identified target audiences, and to put in place the logistics, staffing and funding they need. Based in the Louisville Office, I am a partner of Bingham Greenebaum Doll LLP, where I also advise on investments, mergers, acquisitions and divestitures for U.S. companies and foreign companies' operations in the U.S. I have worked in London, New York City, Tokyo, San Francisco and San Diego as an investment banker and attorney, serving both in-house and as an outside advisor.  I also bring cross-cultural perspectives, having lived and worked in Europe and Asia including earning a Master's degree from a Japanese university.

Fixed Asset LedgerReconciliations












Fixed Asset Ledger Reconciliations

Asset Services provides data reconciliation where the physical inventory data is reconciled against the clients current asset inventory listing. 
				Data reconciliation is performed using two-tier methodology.

Tier I Reconciliation

Tier I reconciliation is an automated process in which items are matched by a unique identifier. 
				Items are first matched by an existing asset tag number, and then the asset serial number as the second matching criteria. 

Tier II Reconciliation

Tier II reconciliation is performed if an additional reconciliation of assets is necessary after the completion of the Tier I reconciliation. 
				A Tier II reconciliation involves a line-by-line comparison of the current asset lists to the physical inventory results in an attempt to identify assets as unique items.

The reconciliation professionals at Asset Services first review the existing asset ledger. From there, the ledger line items are categorized into the following areas:
				


Infrastructure (land, buildings & improvements)
Assets unable to be tagged (software & component hardware)
Questionable ledger entries (Equipment for John)
Non-inventoried assets (items costing less than the capitalization threshold


Asset Services provides the ledger analysis reports and reconciliation reports in Excel or comma delimited format for further analysis 
				or to import into the clients existing asset management system.

Fixed Asset InventorySolutions forHealthcare Facilities












Physical Equipment Inventory for Hospitals & Healthcare Facilities
 				
Asset Services is a leading provider of physical equipment inventories for hospitals & healthcare facilities. 
				Our trained inventory personnel specialize in performing inventory services for major moveable equipment in hospitals, clinics and medical practices. 
				Once an inventory is complete, our valuation professionals can determine the replacement cost and fair market value of the healthcare assets, including: 
				clinical, dietary, information technology, maintenance & facilities equipment.

Track & Maintain Clinical Equipment
Equipment tracking software & maintenance management systems are only as good as the information used to populate the system.  
					Develop an accurate baseline inventory to populate your CMMS or equipment tracking system.
Ensure all clinical equipment at your facility is properly tracked and maintenance records are kept up-to-date.


Facility, Life Safety & Medical Equipment Maintenance
Comply with industry standards that require hospitals to track certain building mechanical and medical equipment and ensure they are maintained at an acceptable level of safety & quality.
The regulations impose significant changes to the way hospitals currently manage life safety and building mechanical equipment. Hospitals are expected to maintain a written inventory to ensure proper maintenance of all facility & medical equipment. 


Healthcare Facility Merger or Acquisition
Fixed asset inventory for hospitals, healthcare systems, clinics and medical practices that are being acquired or merging with other entities.
Determine the fair market value of fixed assets and medical equipment once a complete wall-to-wall inventory is complete.


Joint Commission Institutional Oversight and Control
Perform independent,  professional fixed asset inventory for audit and regulatory compliance.
Provide an accurate inventory for technicians to inspect, test, and maintain high-risk systems.


Hospital Expansion, Construction or Relocation
Identify existing clinical equipment, IT equipment and other fixed assets for reallocation to the new facility. 
Develop an accurate baseline inventory of hospital major moveable assets and clinical equipment at the new facility.


 				Capital Budgeting for the Healthcare System
Plan for future capital purchases based on accurate records of existing assets.
Raise capital through the identification and sale of unused equipment.
Reduce taxes and insurance premiums.





				
				The inventory professionals at Asset Services are experienced in performing equipment inventories in healthcare environments. 
				Whether it is a hospital, clinic, medical office building, operating room, diagnostic imaging center or patient rooms, 
				our teams are highly sensitive to the environment and the concerns of patients, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.

The Asset Services inventory teams will progress through the building and apply barcode property tags to each asset. 
				Information such as location, department, description, manufacturer, model and serial number will be recorded in state-of-the-art barcode data collection terminals. 
				This information is then uploaded to the Asset Services database for our data specialists to review and normalize. 
				After the team analyzes and scrubs the data, the inventory reports are provided as an electronic spreadsheet 
				or delimited format for analysis and easy integration into an existing asset management system. 


				Looking for more information? Read our 
				Fixed Asset Inventory for Healthcare Facilities whitepaper
				or
				Clinical Equipment Inventories whitepaper.
				

				Additional information on the inventory process specific to healthcare facilities can be found here:
				Inventory Process for Hospitals & Healthcare Facilities.

The Asset Services inventory teams will progress through the building and apply barcode property tags to each asset. 
				Information such as location, department, description, manufacturer, model and serial number will be recorded in state-of-the-art barcode data collection terminals. 
				This information is then uploaded to the Asset Services database for our data specialists to review and normalize. 
				After the team analyzes and scrubs the data, the inventory reports are provided as an electronic spreadsheet 
				or delimited format for analysis and easy integration into an existing asset management system. 


				Looking for more information? Read our 
				Fixed Asset Inventory for Healthcare Facilities whitepaper
				or
				Clinical Equipment Inventories whitepaper.
				

				Additional information on the inventory process specific to healthcare facilities can be found here:
				Inventory Process for Hospitals & Healthcare Facilities.

Why Asset Services?

Our inventory teams have extensive training and experience in the identification of assets and equipment in medical environments, 
		 		including clinical and biomedical equipment, IT assets, and standard office equipment and furniture.

Asset Services takes pride in our ability to perform an inventory with no 
				disruption to procedures, patient care and normal daily activities.
		 		  Our small, highly trained and experienced project teams provide greater consistency in the data collection 
				processes, and minimizes our "footprint" at client sites.  
		 		Inventory teams work in close proximity to each other and methodically progress through the facilities.
