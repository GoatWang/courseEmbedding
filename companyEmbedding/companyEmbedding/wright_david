 




David Wright // product designer



















About Me
Iâm David Wright, an award-winning product designer working at a startup in the San Francisco bay area. I have expertise designing editorial products, having spent most of my career in and around digital newsrooms. I believe in framing the problem, user-centered research and egoless collaboration.

Staff designer, Twitter
At Twitter, I focused on creating foundational design systems to help make Twitter a great experience for everyone. I helped ship a bunch of cool stuff, including a project that hasn't launched to the public ... yet.

Design director, National Public Radio
At NPR, I led the teams responsible for the design and UX for all of NPRâs digital products. I was on the team that researched, concepted and launched NPR One. As an individual contributor, I led the design efforts on Planet Money for iPhone, NPR Books, Live Music Events and others.

Wayback
Prior to NPR, I spent three years as a Senior Site designer at USA TODAY. Before that, I was a UI designer at SmartBrief and a multimedia developer Knight-Ridder/Tribune, where I created editorial graphics by hammering out ActionScript on stone tablets. My full work history is documented on LinkedIn.

David Wright Sports Heroes 
New York Mets third baseman David Wright is an extremely talented player who shot straight from high school to the minor leagues. He quickly rose to the majors, bringing with him a reputation as a hard worker and a team player. This book traces Wright's exciting life from his childhood in Virginia through his busy, professional career. Thrilling photographs show this All-Star in action both on and off the field.


* Reviews *
                    Series Review: Sports Heroes"Elementary school sport fans and reluctant readers will eagerly snatch up these short but satisfying biographies. ... Captioned action photos, a page of "Fun Facts," and a useful glossary appear in every volume."--School Library Journal
