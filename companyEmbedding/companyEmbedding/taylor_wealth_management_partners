Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (4.83% upside)

Our Investment Management ApproachProspective clients come to TAYLOR WEALTH MANAGEMENT PARTNERS for expert, trusted counsel on their financial goals and objectives. Our approach is to work with them to develop a thoughtful and targeted investment strategy. In so doing, we structure portfolios that deliver growth and income through a diversified total return strategy which incorporates publicly traded securities (common stocks and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and, when appropriate, other high yield and fixed income securities).
Our investment process is structured to evaluate and monitor the macro environment to ensure the relevance and expected longevity of key investment themes. Our analysis is based upon both fundamental research and proprietary quantitative tools that measure market risk across multiple asset classes. Within the selected investment themes, we invest in securities we believe can deliver superior total returns. We prioritize industry positioning, management team and financial strength as significant inputs in evaluating a company’s investment potential.
In our MLP selections we emphasize those which generate above market distribution growth rates. We rely on our 30 years of MLP investment expertise to add diversification to portfolios of common stocks, as MLPs are an asset class which has proven to be one of the highest total return investment sectors over both the past 10 and 20 year time frames.
We spend a significant amount of time meeting with the managements of companies in our Boston office, at company sites, at investor days, and at industry conferences in order to ascertain the best investment opportunities.
