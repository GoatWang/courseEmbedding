RiskMarketNewsInsurance Risk Trading News and AnalysisRochdale Readies ILS Fund
December 5, 2016 New York-based City National Rochdale Investment Management is planning to launch a new closed-end fund that will focus on reinsurance and insurance-linked securities investments (ILS), according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The City National Rochdale Reinsurance Premium Fund plans to invest 80% of its net assets in reinsurance related securities, including ILWs and event-linked bonds, according to filings. In addition, the fund will used structured equity-linked investments tied quota share arrangements and swaps. The filings do not list the managers of the fund.
The closed-end product will be structured as an interval fund, offering quarterly repurchases of an minimum of 5% of the fund’s outstanding shares typically at net asset value (NAV).
Total operating expenses for the fund are listed as .93%, including a .50% management fee, a service fee of .25% and “other expenses” of .22%. The filings say the fund does not plan to institute a repurchase fee.
Rochdale will join other ILS closed end fund providers such as Pioneer Investments and Stone Ridge Asset Management using closed-end interval fund structures to investment in catastrophe risk. Interval funds allow managers to control sell-offs in illiquid investments by limiting investors ability to cash out at certain “intervals” during a year.
City National Rochdale has $30.7 billion in assets under management and is subsidiary of RBC USA, which in turn is owned by of Royal Bank of Canada.
Representatives from Rochdale did not return a request inquiries.

In its first two years of operation, the City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund which has been launched as a U.S. 1940’s Act mutual insurance and reinsurance linked securities fund by a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada, will target raising ILS assets under management of $500 million in its first two years of operations.

The City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund was registered with the SEC earlier this year, targeting a largely industry loss warranty (ILW) driven reinsurance linked investment strategy, it had initially been registered as the City National Rochdale Reinsurance Premium Fund but was renamed.
The investment manager behind the fund is City National Rochdale, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada and we understand that the initial capital raising is now underway.
As we wrote previously, the mutual fund is structured in an interval style and expects to invest a significant proportion of its assets in Cartesian’s Iris Re vehicle, hence the ILW focus.
So this is more of a partnership between Royal Bank of Canada owned investment manager City National Rochdale and experienced ILS and reinsurance investment manager Cartesian Iris.
In its latest filing the investment manager reveals that the City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund will have a target raising a maximum $500 million of assets under management for its first two years of operation.
This will be to prevent it raising more assets than it can match with attractive reinsurance linked investment opportunities, and with the majority of the investments set to flow into Cartesian’s reinsurer, with now 80% of the fund’s assets expected to be invested in special purpose entities of the Iris Reinsurance Ltd., it means the matching of capital to risks can be more tightly controlled between City National Rochdale and Cartesian.
In total ILW’s are expected to make up around 70% or more of the fund’s allocation, which given the limited size of the ILW market means that raising too much capital could be problematic as well, given available opportunities may not match asset inflows. Hence capping the target for the fund’s assets under management at $500 million for the first two years is prudent.
Further details on how the Rochdale ILS fund will interface with Cartesian’s Iris Re have also been revealed.
Iris Re is expected to create at least thirteen new Special Purpose Entities (akin to segregated accounts), which will be ring-fenced pools of risk for the City National Rochdale ILS fund to invest in.
Each of the special purpose entities generated by Iris Re will enter into ILW contracts with different risk profiles, so providing a pillared approach to diversification, for example Florida wind, all natural perils Europe, U.S. wind, Japan earthquake, etc. This will provide geographic and risk diversification, while other entities may only focus on contracts that trigger above a specific industry loss (eg. Florida wind $40bn, etc).
The City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund will invest in equity linked notes of the Iris Re special purpose entities, while another class of quota share notes may also be available for other hedge funds to invest, which could be Cartesian’s own strategies we’d expect.
For ILS and reinsurance investment manager Cartesian Re, the tie-up with City National Rochdale will offer it a way to bring additional assets into its strategies from mutual fund investors, enabling it to write more risks while benefitting from fee income through the mutual fund.
City National Rochdale benefits by working with a recognised ILW expert manager, which also provides it with a differentiated mutual ILS fund strategy, as the only one currently available to predominantly focus on ILW derivative contracts, rather than more broadly investing in collateralized reinsurance as the other available mutual funds do.

City National Rochdale, LLC’s insurance-linked securities (ILS) and reinsurance linked investment mutual fund is set for launch by the investment advisor. The City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund expects to invest a significant proportion of its assets in Cartesian’s Iris Re vehicle.

City National Rochdale, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of City National Bank, which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of an entity named RBC USA Holdco Corporation, which is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada.
The investment advisor filed a prospectus for an ILS and reinsurance interval mutual fund last December, the City National Rochdale Reinsurance Premium Fund, but yesterday filed a registration statement with the SEC for this differently named 1940’s Act mutual ILS fund.
It turns out that this is the same mutual fund strategy, which has been renamed by Rochdale to the City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund, but will continue to seek out returns from the reinsurance and insurance-linked securities (ILS) market for its investors.
The newly renamed fund is still an interval fund, so will offer liquidity opportunities to investors at intervals in order to control inflows and outflows from investors.
The City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund will invest in “particular types of reinsurance investments providing exposure to the insurance risk of natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes and earthquakes,” the registration statement says.
The fund will invest “significantly” in structured reinsurance investments, “such as equity-linked notes and preferred shares, issued by insurance company segregated accounts or special purpose vehicles whose return is tied to underlying industry loss warranties and/or catastrophe bonds,” it explains.
Under normal investment conditions instruments exposed to ILW’s are anticipated to make up around 70% or more of the fund’s allocation, with equity-linked notes the major vehicle for gaining access to these instruments.
This is interesting as ILW’s are typically accessed directly, but the City National Rochdale fund is set to target them via another vehicle it seems.
The prospectus says; “The fund expects to have indirect exposure exceeding 25% of the fund’s assets to ILWs and/or catastrophe bonds underwritten by Iris Reinsurance Ltd.”
Iris Reinsurance Ltd. (Iris Re), launched in 2009, was sponsored by global private equity investment firm Cartesian Capital Group, LLC and is an affiliate of and managed by Cartesian’s insurance-linked securities (ILS) investment unit Cartesian Re.
Iris Re is a Class 3 Bermudian reinsurance vehicle which predominantly offers its collateralised reinsurance capacity in industry loss warranty (ILW) form, although based on both index and parametric triggers.
So by investing in the equity-linked notes of Iris Re the City National Rochdale mutual fund will achieve its goal of accessing the ILW market.
Also of note is the fact that Iris Re issued a new class of non-voting, redeemable preferred shares and listed them on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) back in April 2016. The manager also said that it would report its modelled net asset value on a regular basis in November last year.
Both of those facts may play into the emergence of this new fund, as through a new share class with transparency in terms of reporting, a mutual fund could invest in Iris Re and benefit from the exposure to its ILW portfolio, while Cartesian Re can benefit from a new source of capital via mutual fund investors and the registered investment advisor marketplace.
The fund, which will be offered to investors through registered investment advisors, is going to have a cap on its assets under management for the first two years of $500 million, which again is interesting but is perhaps something to do with the strategy of seeking to access the ILW market, which has limited supply of course, largely via Cartesian’s Iris Re.
It does seem likely that Cartesian Capital and Cartesian Re are aligned with the launch of City National Rochdale’s first ILS fund, with a type of mutually beneficial partnership arrangement behind the scenes, although we should stress that we cannot confirm that at this time, it’s just an assumption.
The City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund’s portfolio managers are named as Garrett R. D’Alessandro, President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Investment Officer of City National Rochdale, and Thomas H. Ehrlein, a member of the investment advisors asset allocation committee and portfolio manager of its high-yield alternatives fund.
So it would seem plausible that some of the moves made by Cartesian Re to list equity in its ILW focused reinsurance vehicle Iris Re and report the NAV via the equity listing, could help this Rochdale mutual reinsurance fund access that market, while bringing a new source of capital from the mutual fund investment arena to Cartesian Re’ ILS strategies.
Whether by design or happy coincidence, the City National Rochdale Select Strategies Fund will bring new investors into Iris Re’s ILW strategies, which will be a benefit for the manager. For City National Rochdale this strategy will offer it a way to bring a diversified catastrophe reinsurance focused investment strategy to its investor-base as well.
It will be fascinating to watch the fund build out, as being a mutual it will be regularly reported via the SEC.
