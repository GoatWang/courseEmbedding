PRESS RELEASE
 
RADNOR, PA – May 11, 2017 – NewSpring Capital (“NewSpring” or the “Firm”), a family of private equity funds providing growth and expansion capital, today announced the final close of NewSpring Growth Capital IV, L.P. (“NSG IV” or the “Fund”). The Fund successfully raised $280 million, making it the largest growth fund to date and bringing NewSpring’s total assets under management to $1.7 billion.
NSG IV received strong support from existing and new investors, including a diverse group of family offices, insurance companies, public pension plans, fund of funds, financial institutions, and university endowments. Consistent with the investment strategy of its predecessor funds, NSG IV will maintain its unique approach of partnering with leading growth-stage businesses in the information technology, enabling technology, and business services sectors, with an emphasis on the Mid-Atlantic region. 





NewSpring’s growth and expansion stage strategy has invested in over 60 deals since inception.  NSG IV continues to execute on a strong deal pipeline as the team is focused on building out the Fund’s portfolio and to date has committed capital to four portfolio companies: Circonus, Inc., Interactions Corporation, ReviMedia Group, B.V., and Snagajob.com, Inc.
Led by General Partners, Michael DiPiano, Marc Lederman, and Glenn Rieger, who have been deploying capital together since 2000, the investment team continues to grow and expand through both internal talent development and new additions.  In the first quarter of 2017, NewSpring promoted three growth-dedicated investment professionals, including Brian Kim, who was promoted to Principal and now serves on the Boards of NewSpring Growth Capital portfolio companies, CallMiner, Inc. and Relay Network, Inc.  In addition, Justin Nadile was promoted to Vice President and Hart Callahan was promoted to Senior Associate. These individuals exhibit the qualities and attributes that NewSpring values most and reinforce the strong future of NewSpring’s growth strategy.
In addition, the team is pleased to welcome Prashanth (PV) Boccasam, an entrepreneur and investment professional with over 25 years of executive management experience, as an Operating Partner dedicated to the growth strategy.  Most recently, PV served as a General Partner for a DC-area private equity firm and has served on several growth-stage company Boards of Directors, including Appian Corporation, a market leader in modern business process management software, and WealthEngine, a leading provider of predictive marketing analytics.  With his extensive entrepreneurial background, PV further strengthens NewSpring’s dedication to collaborating with the region’s top entrepreneurs to provide strong operational insights. 





“This is a very exciting and dynamic time for NewSpring Growth Capital.  This team is dedicated to providing superior returns for our investors and the continued success of our portfolio companies,” said Marc Lederman, NewSpring General Partner and co-founder of the Firm.  “In addition to PV’s operating acumen, he will be based in metro-Washington, DC, which strengthens the Fund’s presence in the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic region and enables us to further reinforce NewSpring’s brand in the DC/NoVA/Maryland market.”
Lastly, NewSpring Growth Capital will welcome Jason Dresner this summer.  Jason will join the Firm upon his graduation from the Masters of Business Administration program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
NewSpring is extremely excited about the future of NSG IV and the growth strategy.

NewSpring Growth Capital IV Announces Inaugural Investment in Hourly Worker Powerhouse Snagajob




Radnor, PA - February 4, 2016 – NewSpring Capital, a family of private equity funds providing growth and expansion capital, announced today that NewSpring Growth Capital ("NewSpring"), the Firm’s dedicated growth and expansion stage fund, has made its inaugural investment out of its fourth growth equity fund.  NewSpring, along with co-investors Invus Group and Rho Acceleration, provided Snagajob $100 million in funding.  The Company will use the proceeds primarily to expand its product offerings and fund select acquisitions.
Founded in 2000, Snagajob is America’s largest marketplace for hourly job seekers and employers through its work with over 65 million members and nearly 200,000 employers, including nearly half of the brands on the Fortune 1000 list. The company has redefined and optimized sourcing, recruitment, onboarding and management solutions for the hourly worker industry. This investment will help accelerate Snagajob’s vision of offering a fully mobile, on-demand, hourly-hiring process while not compromising quality or accuracy. 
“Snagajob has accomplished impressive growth in the past two years,” said Marc Lederman, NewSpring General Partner.  “With their strong brand recognition, extraordinary management team, and accessible platform, Snagajob offers an unparalleled value proposition to hourly workers and employers wanting to streamline the hiring process.  We are thrilled to add Snagajob to our growing list of successful technology companies.” 
“It’s an exciting time for our industry. However, it's unfortunate that in the age of on-demand everything, the average hourly job seeker is offered no greater efficiencies when looking for a job,” said Peter Harrison, CEO of Snagajob. “It should only take minutes to secure hourly work, not the days and weeks it takes today. This new funding, coupled with the fact that almost a million workers are creating new profiles on Snagajob every month, will dramatically accelerate our realization of this vision. We are very excited to have NewSpring on board as they share this vision and have been great to work with throughout the process." 
As part of the transaction, Marc Lederman of NewSpring Capital and Habib Kairouz of Rho Acceleration will join Snagajob’s Board of Directors.
About Snagajob
With over 65 million members and one million new members every 35 days, Snagajob is America’s #1 spot for hourly work and is helping transform the marketplace for on-demand hourly workers through innovative technology. The Company’s mission is to put people in the right fit-positions so they can maximize their potential and live more fulfilling lives. Since 2000, Snagajob has been responsible for creating products that make instant and quality connections between workers and employers across a variety of industries, including restaurant, retail, hospitality and healthcare. For more information, visit snagajob.com or follow @snagajob.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
