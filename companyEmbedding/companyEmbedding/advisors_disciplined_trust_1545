Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

The trust seeks to provide current interest income and capital preservation.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its objective.






PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The trust seeks to provide current income and to provide capital preservation
by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of long-term Build America
Bonds.  The portfolio was selected by SMC Fixed Income Management, LP, the
portfolio consultant to the trust (the "Portfolio Consultant"), based on
criteria provided by AAM*.  In selecting bonds, the Portfolio Consultant
considered the following factors, among others:


*  the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was not less than A- or the Moody's
Investor Service rating of the bonds was not less than A3 at trust inception;


*  the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and
maturity; and


*  diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer.


The trust portfolio is structured to have a dollar-weighted average maturity
greater than 15 years as of the inception date of the trust.  The portfolio
primarily consists of Build America Bonds.  The portfolio may also include other
taxable municipal bonds but at the inception date the trust will invest at least
80% of its assets in Build America Bonds.  Build America Bonds are taxable debt
obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United
States and political subdivisions and authorities thereof.  The American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for municipal bond issuers to
issue taxable Build America Bonds to finance capital expenditures for which an
issuer could issue tax-exempt bonds and to elect to receive a subsidy payment
from the federal government equal to 35% of the amount of each interest payment
(45% in the case of certain bonds) on such taxable bonds.  A Build America Bond
is defined as any obligation (other than a private activity bond) if (i) the
interest on such obligation would, but for the new provisions, be excludable
from gross income under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) such
obligation is issued before January 1, 2011 and (iii) the issuer makes an
irrevocable election to have the new tax credit provision apply.  The available
subsidy for any applicable bonds in the portfolio will be paid to the bond
issuers only; neither the trust nor unitholders will be entitled to a tax
credit.  Interest on Build America Bonds must be included in gross income of
investors for federal income tax purposes.


Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor any of its affiliates accepts any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of this prospectus or any
information or disclosure that is provided to potential purchasers of interests
in the portfolio, or omitted from disclosure, other than with respect to
statements it has approved relating solely to the Portfolio Consultant.  In
addition, the Portfolio Consultant does not make any representation regarding
the portfolio or the advisability of investing in the portfolio.

PRINCIPAL RISKS



As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:


*  BOND PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over time.


*  THE VALUE OF THE BONDS WILL GENERALLY FALL IF INTEREST RATES, IN GENERAL,
RISE.  No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the
future.


*  A BOND ISSUER MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENT IN THE
FUTURE.


*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur at
any point in time, including during the primary offering period.




<F1>*  "AAM," "we" and related terms mean Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
trust sponsor, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise.


2     Investment Summary





*  A BOND ISSUER MIGHT PREPAY OR "CALL" A BOND BEFORE ITS STATED MATURITY.  If
this happens, the trust will distribute the principal to you but future
interest distributions will fall.  A bond's call price could be less than the
price the trust paid for the bond.  If enough bonds are called, the trust
could terminate earlier than expected.


*  THE TRUST MAY CONCENTRATE IN BONDS OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF ISSUER.  This
makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more
diversified portfolio.  The types of bond in the portfolio are listed under
"Types of Bonds" on page 5.


*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
circumstances, the trust will hold, and may continue to buy, the same bonds
even if the market value declines.

EXAMPLE



This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:






1 year            $334
3 years           $402
5 years           $470
10 years          $640








These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

Build America Bond Portfolio, Series 14 - An SMC FIM Portfolio


We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Advisors
Disciplined Trust 548, Build America Bond Portfolio, Series 14 - An SMC FIM
Portfolio, including the schedule of investments, as of May 31, 2013, and
the related statements of operations and changes in net assets for the year
ended May 31, 2013, 2012 and for the period from June 25, 2010 (initial date
of deposit) through May 31, 2011.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The trust is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
investments owned as of May 31, 2013, by correspondence with The Bank of
New York Mellon, the trustee.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined Trust 548,
Build America Bond Portfolio, Series 14 - An SMC FIM Portfolio at May 31,
2013, and the results of its operations and changes in its net assets for the
periods indicated above in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Schedule of Investments

(1)  This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and
     the call price for that year.  Each bond continues to be callable at
     declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
     issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
     price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
     date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
     subsequent years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with
     respect to an issue of bonds.

     "[Dagger symbol]" indicates that the bond is redeemable in whole or in part
     at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal
     to the greater of (i) the amortized value of the bond (based upon the
     bond's original reoffering yield), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
     date of redemption, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining
     unpaid payments of principal and interest on the bond, discounted to the
     date of redemption based on a yield for comparable municipal bonds (which
     discount rate may be increased by some additional amount for certain
     bonds).  These bonds may generally be redeemed at any time, however,
     certain bonds may only be subject to redemption on certain dates.

     The bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time
     pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain
     events occur.

(2)  See Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements for a description of
     the method of determining value.

(3)  Any bond marked with this note was issued at an original issue discount.
     Tax issues related to these bonds are described under "Understanding Your
     Investment--Taxes."

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



TRUST SPONSOR AND EVALUATOR



Advisors Asset Management, Inc. is the trust's sponsor and evaluator.



BASIS OF ACCOUNTING



The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting.



VALUATION OF SECURITIES



The evaluator generally determines the value of securities on the aggregate bid
side evaluations of the securities determined (a) on the basis of current bid
prices of the securities, (b) if bid prices are not available for any particular
security, on the basis of current bid prices for comparable securities, (c) by
determining the value of securities on the bid side of the market by appraisal,
or (d) by any combination of the above.  Accounting Standards Codification 820,
"Fair Value Measurements" establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosure about fair value measurements in financial statements for the
trust.  The framework under the standard is comprised of a fair value hierarchy,
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The standard
describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in
active markets that the trust has the ability to access as of the
measurement date.


Level 2:  Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data.


Level 3:  Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a trust's own
assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability.


The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing those securities.


Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an
investment's assigned level as described above.


The following table summarizes the trust's investments as of May 31, 2013,
based on inputs used to value them:

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS



Securities transactions are accounted for on a trade basis.  Net realized gain
and losses from sales of securities are determined on the specific
identification cost method.


Interest income consists of amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and
interest accrued as earned on the fixed rate obligations.  As required, the
trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
Investment Companies and is amortizing premiums or accreting discounts on debt
securities.



USE OF ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires the trust's sponsor to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from such
estimates.



ORGANIZATION COSTS



Organization costs are expensed as incurred.

The trust is organized as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  It is the trust's
policy to comply with the special provisions of the Code available to regulated
investment companies.  Such provisions were complied with and, therefore, no
federal income tax provision is required.


The trust accounts for uncertain tax positions under FASB ASC Topic 740, "Income
Taxes", ("ASC 740").  The trust has recognized no liabilities in connection with
ASC 740 in the accompanying financial statements.


As of December 31, 2012, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis

* On December 31, 2012, the trust had no net capital loss carryforwards. To the
extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss carryforward, such gains
will not be distributed.  The aggregate cost, for federal income tax purposes,
of the portfolio of investments is $7,180,847 and the gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation for the investments on a tax basis is $850,153 and
$0, respectively.

UNDERSTANDING YOUR INVESTMENT








HOW TO BUY UNITS



You can buy units of the trust on any business day the New York Stock
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public offering
price of units includes:


*  the net asset value per unit plus


*  the sales fee plus


*  accrued interest, if any.


The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.


Accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a security from the last day
it paid interest.  Accrued interest on the trust units consists of two elements.
The first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the
accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from the last day on which
interest was paid on the bonds.  Interest on the bonds is generally paid semi-
annually, although the trust accrues such interest daily.  Because your trust
always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected, the public
offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued
interest to the date of settlement.  The second element of accrued interest
arises because of the structure of the trust's interest account.  The trustee
has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments
on the bonds in the trust and may be required to advance its own funds to make
trust interest distributions.  As a result, interest account balances are
established to limit the need for the trustee to advance funds in connection
with such interest distributions.  If you sell or redeem your units you will be
entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the
purchaser of your units.


VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities based on the
aggregate bid side evaluations of the securities determined (a) on the basis of
current bid prices of the securities, (b) if bid prices are not available for
any particular security, on the basis of current bid prices for comparable
securities, (c) by determining the value of securities on the bid side of the


16     Understanding Your Investment





market by appraisal, or (d) by any combination of the above.  The offering side
price generally represents the price at which investors in the market are
willing to sell a security and the bid side evaluation generally represents the
price that investors in the market are willing to pay to buy a security.  The
bid side evaluation is lower than the offering side evaluation.


SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.  We refer to
this fee as the "sales fee."  The maximum sales fee equals 3.00% of the public
offering price per unit at the time of purchase.  You pay the sales fee at the
time you buy units.


MINIMUM PURCHASE.  The minimum amount you can purchase of the trust appears
on page 4 under "Essential Information", but such amounts may vary depending on
your selling firm.


REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of
any discount when you order units.


Employees.  We waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made by
officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of the sponsor
and its affiliates. We also waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made
by officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of selling
firms. These purchases are made at the public offering price per unit less the
applicable dealer concession.  Immediate family members for the purposes of this
section include your spouse, children (including step-children) under the age of
21 living in the same household, and parents (including step-parents). All
employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm,
including but not limited to, householding policies or limitations. Only
officers, directors and employees (and their immediate family members) of
selling firms that allow such persons to participate in this employee discount
program are eligible for the discount.


RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.



HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS



You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the
net asset value per unit.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred
to as the "liquidation price".  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction
or other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests.


SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset
value.  We may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering
price or redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase
price is the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also
maintain a secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial
professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best price
available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice.
Even if we do not make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the
trustee on any business day for the current redemption price.



Understanding Your Investment     17






REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset
value per unit.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if
the trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons
that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the
trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price
provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It
is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit
redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in
a timely manner.  If your request is received after that time or is incomplete
in any way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after the trustee
receives your completed request.


If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.


To redeem your units, you must send the trustee any certificates for your
units.  You must properly endorse your certificates or sign a written transfer
instrument with a signature guarantee.  The trustee may require additional
documents such as a certificate of corporate authority, trust documents, a death
certificate, or an appointment as executor, administrator or guardian.  The
trustee cannot complete your redemption or send your payment to you until it
receives all of these documents in complete form.


EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.



DISTRIBUTIONS



MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays interest from its net
investment income (pro-rated on an annual basis) along with any available
principal paid on the securities on each monthly distribution date to
unitholders of record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution
dates are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary"
section of this prospectus.  In some cases, your trust


18     Understanding Your Investment





might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending
distribution.  The amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as
interest and principal payments change or trust expenses change.


Interest received by the trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
trustee to the trust's "interest account".  Other receipts are credited to the
"principal account".  After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the
trustee, without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as
the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date, interest received will
be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date.  All distributions will be net of estimated expenses.
Funds in the principal account will be distributed on each distribution date to
unitholders of record as of the preceding record date provided that the amount
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per unit.


Because interest payments are not received by the trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount
credited to the interest account as of the record date.  For the purpose of
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the trustee is authorized to
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately
equal amounts.  The trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the
interest account on the next record date.  Investors who purchase units between
a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on
the second distribution date after the purchase.


ESTIMATED DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual interest income per unit
and estimated normal monthly distribution per unit are shown under "Essential
Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus as of the
date set forth herein.  We base these amounts on the estimated cash flows of the
bonds per unit.  The actual distributions that you receive will vary from these
estimates with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call, default
or sale of bonds.  You may request the estimated cash flows from the sponsor.
The estimated cash flows are computed based on factors described under
"Understanding Your Investment--How the Trust Works--Estimated Current and Long-
Term Returns".


REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each
distribution.  Each year the trustee or your financial professional will also
provide an annual report on your trust's activity and certain tax information.
You can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your
tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust, if available.






INVESTMENT RISKS



All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.


MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the principal value.  Market value fluctuates in
response to various factors.  These can include changes in interest rates,
inflation, the financial condition of a



Understanding Your Investment     19






security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even
though we supervise your portfolio, you should remember that we do not manage
your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a security solely because the market
value falls as is possible in a managed fund.


INTEREST RATE RISK is the risk that the value of securities will fall if
interest rates increase.  The securities in your trust typically fall in value
when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall.  Securities
with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate
changes.


CREDIT RISK is the risk that a security's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security.


CALL RISK is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity.  An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the
original purpose.  If an issuer calls a bond, your trust will distribute the
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall.  You might
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield.  A bond's call price
could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the
bond's par value.  This means that you could receive less than the amount you
paid for your units.  If enough bonds in your trust are called, your trust could
terminate early.  Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary
optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain
changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other
casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and
various other events.  The call provisions are described in general terms in the
"Schedule of Investments".


BOND QUALITY RISK is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


HIGH YIELD BOND RISK.  The trust may invest in high yield bonds or unrated
bonds.  High yield, high risk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations
and risk of loss than bonds with higher investment ratings.  The value of these
bonds will decline significantly with increases in interest rates, not only
because increases in rates generally decrease values, but also because increased
rates may indicate an economic slowdown.  An economic slowdown, or a reduction
in an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the issuer being unable to
maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal
payments.


High-yield or "junk" bonds, the generic names for bonds rated below "BBB" by
Standard & Poor's or "Baa" by Moody's, are frequently issued by corporations in
the growth stage of their development or by established companies who are highly
leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed.  Bonds rated below
BBB or Baa are considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of
less than investment grade.  Because high-yield bonds are generally subordinated
obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated
bonds, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are
affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.


The market for high-yield bonds is smaller and less liquid than that for
investment grade bonds.  Due to the smaller, less liquid market for high-yield
bonds, the bid-offer spread on such bonds is generally greater than it is for
investment grade bonds and the purchase or sale of such bonds may take longer to
complete.


20     Understanding Your Investment





CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular type of
bond because the portfolio concentrates in bonds of that type.  A portfolio
"concentrates" in a type of bond when bonds in a particular category make up 25%
or more of the portfolio.  The table under "Types of Bonds" under the
"Investment Summary" section for your trust lists the type of bonds held by the
trust with the percentage that each type represents in the portfolio.


General Obligation Bonds.  Certain of the bonds in your trust may be general
obligations of a governmental entity that are secured by the taxing power of the
entity.  General obligation bonds are backed by the issuer's pledge of its full
faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.  The
taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited, however, by provisions
of state constitutions or laws.  An entity's credit will depend on many factors:

tax base, reliance on federal or state aid, and factors which are beyond the
entity's control.


Revenue Bonds.  Certain of the bonds in your trust may be "revenue bonds"
that are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority.  They
not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes, if any.  The risk of
default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the
related project or authority falters because that income is the only source of
payment.  The following types of bonds are "revenue bonds".


Appropriations Bonds.  Certain bonds in your trust may be bonds that are, in
whole or in part, subject to and dependent upon either the governmental entity
making appropriations from time to time or the continued existence of special
temporary taxes which require legislative action for their reimposition.  The
availability of any appropriation is subject to the willingness or ability of
the governmental entity to continue to make such special appropriations or to
reimpose such special taxes.  The obligation to make lease payments exists only
to the extent of the monies available to the governmental entity therefor, and
no liability is incurred by the governmental entity beyond the monies so
appropriated.  Once an annual appropriation is made, the governmental entity's
obligation to make lease rental payments is absolute and unconditional
regardless of any circumstances or occurrences which might arise.  In the event
of non-appropriation, certificateholders' or bondowners' sole remedy (absent
credit enhancement) generally is limited to repossession of the collateral for
resale or releasing.  In the event of non-appropriation, we may instruct the
trustee to sell such bonds.


Airport, Port and Highway Bonds.  Certain facility revenue bonds are payable
from and secured by the revenues from the ownership and operation of particular
facilities, such as airports, highways and port authorities.  Airport operating
income may be affected by the ability of airlines to meet their obligations
under the agreements with airports.  Similarly, payment on bonds related to
other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as use fees
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.  Payment
may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors and
increased cost of maintenance or decreased use of a facility.  The sponsor
cannot predict what effect conditions may have on revenues which are dependent
for payment on these bonds.


Capital Improvement Facility Bonds.  Your trust may contain bonds which are
in the capital improvement facilities category.  Capital improvement bonds are
bonds issued to provide funds to



Understanding Your Investment     21






assist political subdivisions or agencies of a state through acquisition of the
underlying debt of a state or local political subdivision or agency.  The risks
of an investment in such bonds include the risk of possible prepayment or
failure of payment of proceeds on and default of the underlying debt.


Convention Facility Bonds.  Your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the
convention facilities category.  Bonds in the convention facilities category
include special limited obligation bonds issued to finance convention and sports
facilities payable from rental payments and annual governmental appropriations.
The governmental agency is not obligated to make payments in any year in which
the monies have not been appropriated to make such payments.  In addition, these
facilities are limited use facilities that may not be used for purposes other
than as convention centers or sports facilities.


Correctional Facility Bonds.  Your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the
correctional facilities category.  Bonds in the correctional facilities category
include special limited obligation bonds issued to construct, rehabilitate and
purchase correctional facilities payable from governmental rental payments
and/or appropriations.


Education, University and College Bonds.  The ability of educational
institutions, including universities and colleges, to meet their obligations is
dependent upon various factors.  Some of these factors include the size and
diversity of their sources of revenues, enrollment, reputation, management
expertise, the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other
funds, the quality and maintenance costs of campus facilities.  Also, in the
case of public institutions, the financial condition of the relevant state or
other governmental entity and its policies with respect to education may affect
an institution's ability to make payment on its own.


Hospital and Health Care Facility Bonds.  The ability of hospitals and other
health care facilities to meet their obligations with respect to revenue bonds
issued on their behalf is dependent on various factors.  Some such factors are
the level of payments received from private third-party payors and government
programs and the cost of providing health care services.  There can be no
assurance that payments under governmental programs will remain at levels
comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs associated
with these bonds.  It also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care
facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating
expenses to effect changes in its facilities, equipment, personnel and services.
Hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims
and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business.
There can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of
a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a
facility.


Housing Bonds.  Multi-family housing revenue bonds and single family mortgage
revenue bonds are state and local housing issues that have been issued to
provide financing for various housing projects.  Multi-family housing revenue
bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to
moderate income families.  Single-family mortgage revenue bonds are issued for
the purpose of acquiring notes secured by mortgages on residences.  The ability
of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be
affected by various economic and non-economic factors.  Such factors include:

occupancy levels, adequate rental income in multi-family projects, the rate of
default on mortgage loans underlying single family issues and the


22     Understanding Your Investment





ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims.  All single family mortgage revenue
bonds and certain multi-family housing revenue bonds are prepayable over the
life of the underlying mortgage or mortgage pool.  Therefore, the average life
of housing obligations cannot be determined.  However, the average life of these
obligations will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities.  Mortgage
loans are frequently partially or completely prepaid prior to their final stated
maturities.  To the extent that these obligations were valued at a premium when
a unitholder purchased units, any prepayment at par would result in a loss of
capital to the unitholder and reduce the amount of income that would otherwise
have been paid to unitholders.


Industrial Development Revenue Bonds ("IDRs").  IDRs, including pollution
control revenue bonds, are tax-exempt bonds issued by states, municipalities,
public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,
constructing or improving various projects.  These projects are usually operated
by corporate entities.  IDRs are not general obligations of governmental
entities backed by their taxing power.  Issuers are only obligated to pay
amounts due on the IDRs to the extent that funds are available from the
unexpended proceeds of the IDRs or receipts or revenues of the issuer.  Payment
of IDRs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator
of the project or corporate guarantor.  Such corporate operators or guarantors
that are industrial companies may be affected by many factors which may have an
adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry.


Lease Rental Bonds.  Lease rental bonds are predominantly issued by
governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly
raising revenues.  Rather, the authorities are financing vehicles created solely
for the construction of buildings or the purchase of equipment that will be used
by a state or local government.  Thus, the bonds are subject to the ability and
willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which
include debt service on the bonds.  Lease rental bonds are subject to the risk
that the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate
for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year.  These bonds are also
subject to the risk of abatement in many states as rental payments cease in the
event that damage, destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use
by the lessee.  Also, in the event of default by the lessee government, there
may be significant legal and/or practical difficulties involved in the reletting
or sale of the project.


Moral Obligation Bonds.  Your trust may also include "moral obligation"
bonds.  If an issuer of moral obligation bonds is unable to meet its
obligations, the repayment of the bonds becomes a moral commitment but not a
legal obligation of the state or municipality in question.  Thus, such a
commitment generally requires appropriation by the state legislature and
accordingly does not constitute a legally enforceable obligation on debt of the
state.  The agencies or authorities issuing moral obligation bonds generally
have no taxing power.


Power Bonds.  The ability of utilities to meet their obligations with respect
to bonds they issue is dependent on various factors.  These factors include the
rates they may charge their customers, the demand for a utility's services and
the cost of providing those services.  Utilities may also be subject to
extensive regulations relating to the rates which they may charge customers.
Utilities can experience regulatory, political and consumer resistance to rate
increases.  Utilities engaged in long-term capital projects are especially
sensitive



Understanding Your Investment     23






to regulatory lags in granting rate increases.  Utilities are additionally
subject to increased costs due to governmental environmental regulation and
decreased profits due to increasing competition.  Any difficulty in obtaining
timely and adequate rate increases could adversely affect a utility's results of
operations.  The sponsor cannot predict at this time the ultimate effect of such
factors on the ability of any issuers to meet their obligations with respect to
bonds.


Refunded Bonds.  Refunded bonds are typically secured by direct obligations
of the U.S. Government, or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the U.S.
Government, placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent party until
maturity or a predetermined redemption date.  These obligations are generally
non-callable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date.  In a few
isolated instances to date, however, bonds which were thought to be escrowed to
maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity.


Solid Waste Disposal Bonds.  Bonds issued for solid waste disposal facilities
are generally payable from tipping fees and from revenues that may be earned by
the facility on the sale of electrical energy generated in the combustion of
waste products.  The ability of solid waste disposal facilities to meet their
obligations depends upon the continued use of the facility, the successful and
efficient operation of the facility and, in the case of waste-to-energy
facilities, the continued ability of the facility to generate electricity on a
commercial basis.  Also, increasing environmental regulation at the federal,
state and local level has a significant impact on waste disposal facilities.
While regulation requires most waste producers to use waste disposal facilities,
it also imposes significant costs on the facilities.


Special Tax Bonds.  Special tax bonds are payable for and secured by the
revenues derived by a municipality from a particular tax.  Examples of special
taxes are a tax on the rental of a hotel room, on the purchase of food and
beverages, on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor.
Special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the
municipality, and they do not represent general obligations of the municipality.
Payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by a reduction in
revenues realized from the underlying special tax.  Also, should spending on the
particular goods or services that are subject to the special tax decline, the
municipality may be under no obligation to increase the rate of the special tax
to ensure that sufficient revenues are raised from the shrinking taxable base.


Tax Allocation Bonds.  Tax allocation bonds are typically secured by
incremental tax revenues collected on property within the areas where
redevelopment projects, financed by bond proceeds are located.  Bond payments
are expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived from
higher assessed values of property resulting from development in the particular
project area and not from an increase in tax rates.  Special risk considerations
include: variations in taxable values of property in the project area;
successful appeals by property owners of assessed valuations; substantial
delinquencies in the payment of property taxes; or imposition of any
constitutional or legislative property tax rate decrease.


Transit Authority Bonds.  Mass transit is generally not self-supporting from
fare revenues.  Additional financial resources must be made available to ensure
operation of mass transit systems as well as the timely payment of debt service.
Often such financial resources include federal and state subsidies, lease
rentals paid by funds of the state or local government or a pledge of a special
tax.  If


24     Understanding Your Investment





fare revenues or the additional financial resources do not increase
appropriately to pay for rising operating expenses, the ability of the issuer to
adequately service the debt may be adversely affected.


Water and Sewer Revenue Bonds.  Water and sewer bonds are generally payable
from user fees.  The ability of state and local water and sewer authorities to
meet their obligations may be affected by a number of factors.  Some such
factors are the failure of municipalities to utilize fully the facilities
constructed by these authorities, declines in revenue from user charges, the
possible inability to obtain rate increases, rising construction and maintenance
costs, impact of environmental requirements, the difficulty of obtaining or
discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs,
the impact of "no growth" zoning ordinances and the continued availability of
federal and state financial assistance and of municipal bond insurance for
future bond issues.


LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid
trading market will exist for any security because these securities generally
trade in the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities
exchange).


LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISK is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your trust.  Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on securities.


"WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  "When, as and if issued" bonds
are bonds that trade before they are actually issued.  Bonds purchased on a
"when issued" basis have not yet been issued by the issuer on the trust's
inception date although such issuer has committed to issue such bonds.  This
means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust "when, as and if" the
bonds are actually issued.  In addition, other bonds may have been purchased by
the sponsor on a "delayed delivery" basis.  These bonds are expected to be
delivered to the trust after the trust's first settlement date (normally three
business days after the trust's inception date).


Delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these
bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the
trust.  You may have to adjust your tax basis of any bonds delivered after the
expected delivery date.  Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued
between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your
trust.  This could lower your first year estimated current return.  You may
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even
though your trust has not yet received them.


ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Original issue discount bonds were initially
issued at a price below their face (or par) value.  These bonds typically pay a
lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par
value.  In a stable interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds
tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the
bonds approach maturity.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or
redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the
bond's par value.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond.  These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life.  If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity.  The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest



Understanding Your Investment     25






rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments.  The issuers of
these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date
and at a price less than the bond's par value.


MARKET DISCOUNT.  The portfolio of the trust may consist of some bonds whose
current market values were below the principal value on the trust's inception
date or your unit purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such
bonds being less than the principal value is that the interest rate of such
bonds is at a lower rate than the current market interest rates for comparable
bonds.  Bonds selling at market discounts tend to increase in market value as
they approach maturity.  A market discount tax-exempt bond held to maturity will
have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable ordinary income
and less in the form of tax-exempt income than a comparable bond bearing
interest at current market rates.


PREMIUM BONDS.  The portfolio of the trust may consist of some bonds whose
current market values were above the principal value on the trust's inception
date or your unit purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such
bonds being higher than the principal value is that the interest rate of such
bonds is at a higher rate than the current market interest rates for comparable
bonds.  The current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially
higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value
as they approach maturity when the principal value becomes payable.  Because
part of the purchase price is effectively returned not at maturity but through
current income payments, early redemption of a premium bond at par or any other
amount below the trust's purchase price will result in a reduction in yield.
Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant
to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the bonds have a market
value that represents a premium over par or for original issue discount
securities a premium over the accreted value.


PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT.  The Portfolio Consultant may be unsuccessful in
identifying bonds consistent with the trust's investment strategy.  The trust
may not achieve its objective if this happens.



BOND INSURANCE



Bonds are not required to be covered by insurance to be included in your
trust.  Certain bonds may, however, be covered by insurance guaranteeing payment
of interest and principal, when due.  The premium for any bond insurance is paid
by the issuer or by a prior owner of the bonds and any policy is non-cancelable
and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and
the bond insurer remains in business.  The bond insurers, if any, are listed in
the bond names in the "Portfolio" and a table following the "Portfolio".  Bond
insurance, if any, guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on
the bonds when they fall due.  For this purpose, "when due" generally means the
stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal and interest.  The
insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the
trust units.  Each bond insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business.  Such
regulation, however, is no guarantee that a bond insurer will be able to perform
on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made.


Most bond insurance companies have recently had their credit ratings
downgraded or placed on review for possible downgrade by recognized credit
rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
While many insurance companies have historically maintained a "AAA" credit
rating, most insurance companies are currently assigned a credit rating below
this


26     Understanding Your Investment





level.  To the extent that the issuer of a bond in your trust portfolio does not
independently maintain a credit rating equal to or higher than the insurer of
the bond, if any, a downgrade in the rating of a bond insurer will result in a
downgrade in the rating of the related bond.  This could have a material adverse
effect on the value of the bonds and the value of your units.



HOW THE TRUST WORKS



YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to us.
Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.  These
units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.  The
number of units, fractional interest of each unit in a trust, estimated interest
distributions per unit and estimated current and long-term returns will increase
or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.


CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will
generally buy and sell securities:


*  to pay expenses,


*  to issue additional units or redeem units,


*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,


*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
or


*  as permitted by the trust agreement.


When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  Your trust will generally reject
any offer for securities or other property in exchange for the securities in its
portfolio.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will either
hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or
property and distribute the proceeds.


We may increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create
additional units, we will seek to maintain a portfolio that replicates the
principal amounts of the securities in the portfolio.  When your trust buys
securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You could
experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations
in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys
the securities.  Because the trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the
creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and
exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result
in higher brokerage expenses.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we may
direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that
sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee.


In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for the
trust under a contract ("failed bonds"), the sponsor is authorized to purchase
other bonds ("replacement bonds").  The trustee shall pay for replacement bonds
out of funds held in connection with the failed bonds and will accept delivery
of such bonds to make up the original principal of the trust.  The replacement
bonds must be purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the
failed contract, and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not
exceed the principal attributable to the failed bonds.  Whenever a replacement
bond



Understanding Your Investment     27






has been acquired for the trust, the trustee shall, within five days thereafter,
notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement bond
and shall, on the next distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter,
make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost to the
trust of the failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement bond.  In
addition, a replacement bond must (at the time of purchase):


*  be a taxable municipal bond;


*  have a fixed maturity or disposition date comparable to that of the failed
bond it replaces;


*  be purchased at a price that results in a yield to maturity and in a
current return which is approximately equivalent to the yield to maturity
and current return of the failed bond which it replaces; and


*  be rated at least in the category of A- or the equivalent by a major rating
organization.


If the right of limited substitution described above shall not be used to
acquire replacement bonds in the event of a failed contract, the sponsor will
refund the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds to all unitholders of
the trust, and distribute the principal attributable to such failed bonds on the
next monthly distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter.  In the
event a replacement bond is not acquired by the trust, the estimated net annual
interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current and long-
term returns might be lowered.


ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS.  The estimated current return and
the estimated long-term return are shown under "Essential Information" in the
"Investment Summary" section of this prospectus as of the date set forth herein.
Estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual
interest income per unit by the public offering price.  The estimated net annual
interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your
trust and with the default, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds.
The public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present estimated current return
will be realized in the future.  Estimated long-term return is calculated using
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales
charge associated with units.  Since the value and estimated retirements of the
bonds and the expenses of your trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present estimated long-term return will be realized in the future.  The
estimated current return and estimated long-term return are expected to differ
because the calculation of estimated long-term return reflects the estimated
date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return
calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price.


In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the sponsor or
trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on
the trust's inception date.  This cash may exceed the interest which would
accrue to the first settlement date.  The trustee has agreed to pay for any
amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become
available from interest payments on the related bonds.


28     Understanding Your Investment





AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be
defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely affect your
interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change this
agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.  Investors
owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this agreement.


TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate upon the maturity,
payment, redemption, sale or other liquidation of all of the securities in the
portfolio.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust
is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at the
time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue
burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your
trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate
the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the
public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be
reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time they were
deposited in the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales charge that
you paid.


The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you
originally paid for your units.


THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Building 800, Suite 102, Wichita, Kansas 67226 or
by using the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a
registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor or become
bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust without a
sponsor, or terminate your trust.


We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your
trust.


The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an



Understanding Your Investment     29






affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or
director for the issuers of the securities.


THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust with
its principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place,
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some
cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and
investors.


PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT.  The Portfolio Consultant, SMC Fixed Income Management,
LP, is a privately owned investment manager.  In addition to providing portfolio
consulting services to the trust, the Portfolio Consultant provides investment
management services to mutual funds, and managed accounts for high net worth
individuals and also makes direct investments on behalf of its clients.  The
Portfolio Consultant was founded in 2006 and is based in Princeton, New Jersey.
The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The Portfolio
Consultant selected a list of bonds to be included in the portfolio based on the
criteria provided by the sponsor.  The Portfolio Consultant makes no
representations that the bond portfolio will achieve the investment objectives
or will be profitable or suitable for any particular potential investor.  The
Portfolio Consultant cannot forecast or guarantee future results and many risk
factors, including but not limited to market fluctuations, may effect the
Portfolio Consultant's bond selection and the bond portfolio's performance.
Potential clients should consult with their tax and legal advisers before making
such an investment.  The Portfolio Consultant may use the list of bonds in its
independent capacity as an investment adviser and distribute this information to
various individuals and entities.  The Portfolio Consultant may recommend to
other clients or otherwise effect transactions in the bonds held by the trust.
This may have an adverse effect on the prices of the bonds.  This also may have
an impact on the price the trust pays for the bonds and the price received upon
unit redemptions or liquidation of the bonds.  The Portfolio Consultant also
issues reports and makes recommendations on securities, which may include the
bonds in the trust.  Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the sponsor manages
the trust.  Opinions expressed by the Portfolio Consultant are not necessarily
those of the sponsor, and may not actually come to pass.  The Portfolio
Consultant is being compensated for its portfolio consulting services, including
selection of this trust portfolio.  A portion of this compensation is paid by
the trust as part of the trust's organization costs and the remainder will be
paid by the sponsor.  The Portfolio Consultant has not independently verified,
and shall have no liability for determining whether the bond selection criteria
is appropriate for the investment strategy.


HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when
they sell units.  The distribution fee (the broker-dealer concession or agency
commission) for broker-dealers and other firms is equal to 2.50% of the public
offering price per unit at the time of purchase.


We currently provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,
additional


30     Understanding Your Investment





compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this trust and our
other products.  This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past
sales.  A number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these
additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not limited to, the level
or type of services provided by the intermediary, the level or expected level of
sales of our products by the intermediary or its agents, the placing of our
products on a preferred or recommended product list and access to an
intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an
intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in broker-
dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of our
products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of intermediaries
that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or on behalf of,
intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of
facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or purchasing trading
systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional compensation
described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described above, some of
which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an incentive for
financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products,
including this trust, over other products.  These arrangements will not change
the price you pay for your units.


We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in
part.


We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to
create units.



TAXES



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.



Understanding Your Investment     31






TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's
distributions into three categories, ordinary income distributions, capital
gains dividends and return of capital.  Ordinary income distributions are
generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below,
certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at
the capital gains tax rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gains
dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your
units.  To determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends,
you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after
considering all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In
addition, the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status
of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest
your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from
your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had
received them on December 31 of the previous year.  Under the "Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,"  income from the trust may also be
subject to a new 3.8 percent "medicare tax"  imposed for taxable years beginning
after 2012.  This tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your
adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in
the case of married couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of
single individuals.


DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be
reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.


SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.


CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain
is generally 20%  for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15% for taxpayers in
the 25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in the 10% and 15%
tax brackets.  Capital gains may also be subject to the "medicare tax" discussed
above.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year


32     Understanding Your Investment





and is short-term if the holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You
must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period.
However, if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your
unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be
recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain
dividend received.  The tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held
for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income.  The
Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special
situations.


Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a
regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself.  The trust
will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which
may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains
tax rates.


EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over
into a future series of the trust, the exchange would generally be considered a
sale for federal income tax purposes.


DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In some cases,
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as
income.  In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.  Some individuals may also
be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions,
depending on their income.


FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.


INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.  If the trust holds an equity
interest in any "passive foreign investment companies" ("PFICs"), which are
generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual
gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents
and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in
investments producing such passive income, the trust could be subject to U.S.
federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain
distributions with respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or
gain is timely distributed to its unitholders.  The trust will not be able to
pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes.  The
trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax
consequences.  In this case, the trust would recognize as ordinary income any
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in
such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income.
Under this election, the trust might be required to recognize in a year income
in excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of
PFIC stock during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to
the distribution



Understanding Your Investment     33






requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax.
Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as qualified dividend income.


FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust properly reports as
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However,
distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly
reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust makes
certain elections and certain other conditions are met.  In the case of
dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to 2014,
distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an
interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest income received by
the trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net
short-term capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes when received by certain
foreign investors, provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain
other conditions are met.  In addition, distributions in respect of units after
June 30, 2014 may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of
distributions to (i) certain non-U.S. financial institutions that have not
entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain
information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an
agreement with the U.S. Treasury and (ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that
do not provide certain certifications and information about the entity's U.S.
owners.  Dispositions of shares by such persons may be subject to such
withholding after December 31, 2016.  You should also consult your tax advisor
with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.






EXPENSES



Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the
estimated amount of these expenses.


Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.


Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the
sponsor, legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs
incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.
Your trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.
The trustee will generally pay trust expenses from interest income and

principal payments received on the securities but in some cases may sell
securities to pay trust expenses.

GENERAL INFORMATION



Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).  The sponsor provides services to unit investment trusts
through its Advisor's Asset Management division.


When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of
units of the trust.  Additional units of each trust may be issued from time to
time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or contracts for the
purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit) or cash
(including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase
additional securities.  As additional units are issued by a trust as a result of
the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor, the aggregate value of the
securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest
in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased.  The sponsor may
continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust, provided that
such additional deposits will be in principal amounts which will generally
maintain the same original percentage relationship among the principal amounts
of the securities in such trust established by the initial deposit of the
securities.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each unit will
generally continue to represent the same principal amount of each security, and
the percentage relationship among the principal amount of each security in the
related trust will generally remain the same.  If the sponsor deposits cash to
purchase additional securities, existing and new investors may experience a
dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income
because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the
cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay
any associated brokerage fees.


The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the
trust portfolio.


Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the
trust agreement.


A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under the "Schedule of
Investments" in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in
the trust, (b) any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant
to the provisions of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts
of the trust.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way
for any failure in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the
purchase of any of the


-2-





securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless
substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are
reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement,
refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all
unitholders on the next distribution date.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES



The trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income and to
provide capital preservation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of
long-term Build America Bonds.  There is, of course, no guarantee that the trust
will achieve its objective.  The portfolio may
also include other taxable municipal bonds but under normal circumstances the
trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds.  Build
America Bonds are taxable debt obligations issued by or on behalf of states and
territories of the United States and political subdivisions and authorities
thereof.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for
municipal bond issuers to issue taxable "Build America Bonds" to finance capital
expenditures for which an issuer could issue tax exempt bonds and to elect to
receive a subsidy payment from the federal government equal to 35% of the amount
of each interest payment on such taxable bonds.  The prospectus provides
additional information regarding the trust's objective and investment strategy.


The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic,
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.


The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in the special circumstances discussed herein
regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities.
Thus, with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in
accordance with their terms, the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under
normal circumstances.


The sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of
which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of
certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market
factors, including advance refunding, so that in the opinion of the sponsor the
retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of
the unitholders.  The proceeds from any such sales, exclusive of any portion
which represents accrued interest, will be credited to the Principal Account of
such trust for distribution to the unitholders.


The sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of securities to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for
trust securities, the trustee shall reject such offer.  However, should any
issuance, exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or
without an initial offer, any securities or property received shall be deposited
in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor
advises the


-3-





trustee to keep such securities or properties.  The excess cash proceeds of any
such sales will be distributed to unitholders.


If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in
the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.
The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is
the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the
sponsor, would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In
such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment
of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in
the trust on the trust's inception date. The sponsor may also instruct the
trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax
purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.


The trustee may sell securities, designated by the sponsor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.


In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment
company.


Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Principal
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the
portfolio securities is prohibited.


Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in
accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be
distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can be given
that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and
composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for
any default, failure or defect in any security.  In the event of a failure to
deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract,
including those securities purchased on a "when, as and if issued" basis
("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to
direct the trustee to acquire other securities ("Replacement Securities") to
make up the original corpus of such trust.


Securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a "when, as
and if issued" or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place
after the first settlement date.


-4-





Accordingly, the delivery of such securities may be delayed or may not occur.
Interest on these securities begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on
their respective dates of delivery.  Unitholders of all trusts will be "at risk"
with respect to any "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" securities
included in their respective trust (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from
fluctuations in the evaluation of such securities) from the date they commit for
units.


The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of
the Failed Securities.  The purchase price of the Replacement Securities
(exclusive of accrued interest) shall not exceed the principal attributable to
the Failed Securities. In addition, no substitution of Replacement Securities
will be made without an opinion of counsel that such substitution will not
adversely affect the federal income tax status of the related trust.  Whenever a
Replacement Security is acquired for a trust, the trustee shall, within five
days thereafter, notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the
Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date which is
more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if
any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded the cost of
the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are acquired,
the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust, i.e., the
trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to
improve a unitholder's investment.


If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the
principal and accrued interest attributable to such Failed Securities not more
than 30 days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to
purchase a Replacement Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that,
at the time of receipt of such principal, they may not be able to reinvest such
proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which
such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust.


Whether or not a Replacement Security is acquired, an amount equal to the
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Securities) will be paid to
unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the Failed Securities
from the trust if the sponsor determines not to purchase a Replacement Security
or to the date of substitution if a Replacement Security is purchased.  All such
interest paid to unitholders which accrued after the date of settlement for a
purchase of units will be paid by the sponsor.  In the event a Replacement
Security could not be acquired by a trust, the net annual interest income per
unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return and
estimated long-term return might be lowered.


Subsequent to the trust's inception, a security may cease to be rated or
its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trust's
inception.  Neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a
trust, but may be considered in the sponsor's determination to direct the
trustee to dispose of such investment.


The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the
happening of certain extraordinary circumstances.  Certain of the securities may
be subject to optional call or


-5-





mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions, in each case prior to
their stated maturity.  A bond subject to optional call is one which is subject
to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer, often
at a premium over par.  A refunding is a method by which a bond issue is
redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds of a new bond issue.  A bond
subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from
time to time at par with proceeds from a fund accumulated for the scheduled
retirement of a portion of an issue to maturity.  Special or extraordinary
redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par of all or a portion of
an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances.  Redemption pursuant to
optional call provisions is more likely to occur, and redemption pursuant to
special or extraordinary redemption provisions may occur, when the securities
have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par, that is,
when they are able to be refinanced at a lower cost.  The proceeds from any such
call or redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions, as well as proceeds from
the sale of securities and from securities which mature in accordance with their
terms from a trust, unless utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption,
will be distributed to unitholders of such trust and will not be used to
purchase additional securities for such trust.  Accordingly, any such call,
redemption, sale or maturity will reduce the size and diversity of a trust and
the net annual interest income of such trust and may reduce the estimated
current return and the estimated long-term return.  The call, redemption, sale
or maturity of securities also may have tax consequences to a unitholder.


Certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may have been acquired
at a market discount from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on
the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
trusts were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds
of comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued
comparable securities increase, the market discount of previously issued
securities will become greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued
comparable securities decline, the market discount of previously issued
securities will be reduced, other things being equal.  Investors should also
note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase
in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates
decrease.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of securities
purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at
a market premium.  In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of
higher yielding, premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower
yielding, discount securities will be reduced.  A discount security held to
maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable
income and capital gain and loss in the form of tax-exempt interest income than
a comparable security newly issued at current market rates.  Market discount
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence
in the issue.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way
for any default, failure or defect in any of the securities.


Certain of the securities in the trust may be "zero coupon" bonds, i.e., an
original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current
interest.  Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond
and does not receive any periodic interest payments.  The effect of owning deep
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such
obligation.  This implicit reinvestment of


-6-





earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the
income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the
discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to
reinvest at higher rates in the future.  For this reason, zero coupon bonds are
subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing
market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay
interest currently.


To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security which might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.






RISK FACTORS



MUNICIPAL BONDS. The trusts include certain types of bonds described below.
Accordingly, an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of
the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds
included in each trust are described in the prospectus. Neither the sponsor nor
the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.


Certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity
that are backed by the taxing power of such entity. All other bonds in the
trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General
obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and
taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the
other hand, are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular
facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a
special excise tax or other specific revenue source. There are, of course,
variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust, both within a
particular classification and between classifications, depending on numerous
factors.


Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from
mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured or may be
single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from
originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences
located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate
income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to
their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged
premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds are
subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. Additionally,
unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce
revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage
revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under Section 103A of the Internal
Revenue


-7-





Code, which Section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the
proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its
tax-exempt status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply
with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an
opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from personal Federal income
tax under existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have
considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated
first redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with the housing bonds held
by a trust, the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the
respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such
bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates.


Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds
issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that
contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's
gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by
future events and conditions including, among other things, demand for services
and the ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition with other
health care facilities, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost
and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs, government regulation
and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance,
including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party
pay or programs.


Certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers,
including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas. General
problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large
construction programs in an inflationary period, the limitations on operations
and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in
obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. In
addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to
time review existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the
licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may
adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make
payments of principal and/or interest on such bonds.


Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are
derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such bonds are
generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include the
ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.


Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have
generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and
receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular
project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers. In some cases, a mortgage
on the underlying project may have been granted as


-8-





security for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely
dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many
factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular
company or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings,
regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents
or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or
effected.


Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments
of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease obligations"). Lease
obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation. Although the
lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for
which the municipality's taxing power is pledged, a lease obligation is
ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant to appropriate for and make the
payments due under the lease obligation. However, certain lease obligations
contain "non-appropriation" clauses which provide that the municipality has no
obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated
for such purpose on a yearly basis. A governmental entity that enters into such
a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make
lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any
lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A
governmental entity's failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its
lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the
obligations secured thereby. Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are
secured by the leased property, disposition of the property in the event of
foreclosure might prove difficult.


Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are, or which
govern the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and whose revenues
are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems, from
tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to
school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a
disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools
in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of
funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trust. General problems
relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a
declining percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals,
possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased
operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and
state funding, and government legislation or regulations which may adversely
affect the revenues or costs of such issuers.


Certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention
centers and arenas. The major portion of an airport's gross operating income is
generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines


-9-





pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases,
occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income
may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their
obligations under the use agreements. From time to time the air transport
industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to
increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic
constraints and other factors, and several airlines have experienced severe
financial difficulties. Similarly, payment on bonds related to other facilities
is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls
on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be
adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased
cost of maintenance, decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative
modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.


Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured
by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities. Resource
recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and
convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a
project; contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw materials,
operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or
technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of
a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts
relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose
unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The sponsor cannot predict the
causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust
prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.


Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par
value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they
were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market
interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If such
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount
of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for
newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously issued
bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should also note that
the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster
than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely,
if interest rates increase, the value of bonds purchased at a market discount
will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if
interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium bonds and
the prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A
bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger
portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and
less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly
issued at current market rates. Market discount attributable to interest changes
does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue.  Neither the sponsor
nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in
any of the bonds.


Certain of the bonds held by the trust may have been acquired at a market
premium from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on the premium
bonds at the time they were purchased by the trust were higher than the current
market interest rates for newly issued bonds


-10-





of comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued and
otherwise comparable bonds decrease, the market premium of previously issued
bonds will be increased, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable
bonds increase, the market premium of previously issued bonds will be reduced,
other things being equal.  The current returns of bonds trading at a market
premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a
similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds
tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount
becomes payable.  Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a premium bond
at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield.
Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant
to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an
offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original
issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value.


Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero coupon bonds are
purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to
receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any
periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds which do
not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is that a
fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in effect,
on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which
pay interest.


Certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued"
or "delayed delivery" basis. See "Notes to Portfolio" in the prospectus. The
delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur. Interest on these
Bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of
delivery. To the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a trust after their
respective expected dates of delivery, unitholders who purchase their unit prior
to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required
to adjust their tax basis in their unit for a portion of the interest accruing
on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of unit and the actual
delivery of such bonds. As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated
Current Returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated
in the Prospectus which would be the returns after the first year, assuming the
portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the
trustee (which may be reduced in the first year only) do not vary from that set
forth in the prospectus. Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all bonds
in the portfolios including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed delivery"
bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation
of such bonds) from the date they commit for unit.


Certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated
maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call provisions or
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise. A
sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement
of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or


-11-





refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A refunding is a method
by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds
of a new debt obligation. In general, call provisions are more likely to be
exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it
is at a discount from par. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit
redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may result in a
reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions; it may also affect
the current return on unit of the trust involved. Each trust portfolio contains
a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions, if any, with respect to each
of the debt obligations. Extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory
redemptions result from the happening of certain events. Generally, events that
may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the
mandatory redemption of bonds include, among others: a final determination that
the interest on the bonds is taxable; the substantial damage or destruction by
fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were
used; an exercise by a local, state or Federal governmental unit of its power of
eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the
proceeds of the bonds were used; changes in the economic availability of raw
materials, operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes
which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds
were used uneconomic; changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree
which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the
bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates
unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not
imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user
of the proceeds of the bonds; an administrative or judicial decree which
requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project
financed with the proceeds of the bonds; an overestimate of the costs of the
project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess
proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds; or an underestimate
of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be
applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or
reserved the right to sell, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to
third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with
the stated redemption provisions of such bonds. In such a case the issuer no
longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the
rights from such third party. A third party pursuant to these rights may
exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the
issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold
such rights. The sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may
result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See also the discussion of
single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more information
on the call provisions of such bonds.


To the best knowledge of the sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts. At any time after the
trust's inception date, litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with
respect to bonds in a trust. Such litigation, as, for example, suits challenging
the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection
statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the tax-free nature of the
interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be
entirely predicted, each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond
counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the
effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is


-12-





exempt from personal Federal income tax. In addition, other factors may arise
from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet
obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds.


ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent)
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations
in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the
purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage
fees and other acquisition costs.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS



Insurance has been obtained on certain bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of
interest and principal, when due, in respect of the bonds.  See "Bond Insurance"
in the prospectus.  There have been a number of recent developments with respect
to ratings actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies,
Standard & Poor's, a Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("Standard &
Poor's"), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings Ltd.
("Fitch").  In light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or announcements
by the rating agencies, you should consult announcements by the rating agencies,
the websites of the rating agencies, and the websites of the portfolio insurers
for the current publicly available information.  These ratings actions have had
a significant impact on the portfolio insurers', and other bond insurers',
ability to compete in the financial guarantee business.  A brief description of
potential insurers is contained below.


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty").  ACA
Financial Guaranty is an insurance subsidiary of ACA Capital Holding, Inc.,
organized in the State of Maryland.  ACA Financial Guaranty assumes credit risk
through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies across all of its
business lines.  Their insured risk portfolio contains exposures of various
credit qualities.


On December 15, 2008, Standard & Poor's withdrew its ratings of ACA
Financial Guaranty at the company's request, which remains in effect as of
January 7, 2013.  On December 15, 2008, Standard & Poor's had raised its
financial strength, financial enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA
Financial Guaranty to B from CCC and removed the company from its CreditWatch
developing status.  The outlook was developing.  The upgraded rating reflected
the positive effects of the restructuring transaction completed in August 2008
that settled all outstanding collateralized debt obligations ("CDO") and
reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly deteriorated
CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a requirement
to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS counterparties.
The settlement required that ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash
payment and a distribution of surplus notes.  The surplus notes provided the
former CDO counterparties and certain other counterparties with what amounted to
a 95% economic interest in the company.  As a result of the transaction, the
company's $7 billion risk portfolio was


-13-





comprised almost exclusively of U.S. public finance exposure predominantly of
BBB and BB credit quality with above-average concentrations in the health care
and higher education sectors.  The developing outlook reflected the following
possibilities: that the company could run off in an orderly fashion with capital
adequacy improving due to low losses and effective expense management; or that
capital adequacy could deteriorate through a combination of meaningful losses
precipitated by weak credits and/or a soft economy, poor expense management,
and/or excessive distributions to surplus noteholders as allowed by the Maryland
Insurance Administration.  On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and
counterparties to its structured finance products reached an agreement on a
restructuring plan.  The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance
Administration, provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations
and protection for ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders.  ACA
Financial Guaranty has since operated as a runoff insurance company and focused
on monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.


As of June 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had net admitted assets of
approximately $439.6 million and total liabilities of approximately $333.3
million, as compared to approximately $448.2 million and $330.9 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2011.  The statutory surplus was approximately
$106.2 million as of June 30, 2012, and $117.3 million as of December 31, 2011.


The parent company of ACA Financial Guaranty maintains a website at
www.aca.com where it makes available, free of charge and as soon as reasonably
practicable after they file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), copies of their most recently filed Annual Report on
Form 10-K, all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and all Current Reports on Form 8-
K, including all amendments to those reports.

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance").  Ambac Financial Group,
Inc., headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated on
April 29, 1991 with activities divided into two business segments: (i) financial
guarantee and (ii) financial services.  Ambac Assurance provides financial
guarantee insurance for public and structured finance obligations.  Ambac
Assurance is the successor to the founding financial guarantee insurance
company, which wrote the first bond insurance policy in 1971.  The holding
company is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to pay dividends
on its common stock, to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to
pay its operating expenses.


On November 8, 2010, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. announced that it filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and intends to continue to operate in the
ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The
court entered an order confirming the company's plan of reorganization on March
14, 2012. As of January 7, 2013, however, the company was not able to estimate
when it will be able to consummate such reorganization. Until the plan of


-14-





reorganization is consummated and the company emerges from bankruptcy, it will
continue to operate in the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession"
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy
Code and the orders of the bankruptcy court.


On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew its Caa2 rating of Ambac Assurance for
business reasons, which withdrawal remains in effect as of January 7, 2013.  On
November 29, 2010, Ambac Assurance requested that Standard & Poor's withdraw its
ratings, which withdrawal remains in effect as of January 7, 2013.  Standard and
Poor's previously changed Ambac Assurance's rating on March 25, 2010, from CC to
R to reflect the level of regulatory intervention at Ambac Assurance following a
directive by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin.  Ratings
are an essential part of Ambac Assurance's ability to provide credit enhancement
and are essential to Ambac Assurance's ability to compete in the financial
guarantee business.  Considering the high levels of delinquencies and defaults
within residential mortgage loans, each of these rating agencies began a review
of the capital adequacy of the financial guarantee industry in the fall of 2007.
In late December 2007, following the rating agency reviews, Ambac Assurance's
AAA rating was affirmed by both Standard & Poor's (with a negative outlook) and
Moody's; however, Fitch placed Ambac Assurance's triple-A rating on "rating
watch negative" and stated that Ambac Assurance had a modeled $1 billion capital
shortfall.  On June 18, 2008, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. announced its decision
to terminate its ratings contract with Fitch.  By July 2008, Ambac Assurance was
rated AA with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's and Aa3 with a negative
outlook by Moody's.


On July 28, 2009, Ambac Assurance announced a large estimated increase in
loss reserve for the second quarter of 2009 which would reduce regulatory
capital to levels below the regulatory-required minimum threshold.  Moody's
cautioned in late January 2010 that Ambac Assurance's capitalization remained
stressed due to mortgage-related exposures and high operating leverage that
could result in relatively modest changes in mortgage loss estimates to have
substantial effects on capital adequacy.  On November 8, 2010, Ambac Financial
Group, Inc., Ambac Assurance's parent holding company, announced that it filed
for a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
of New York.  The company announced that it was unable to raise additional
capital as an alternative to seeking bankruptcy protection and was also unable
to agree to terms with an ad-hoc committee of certain senior debt holders in
order to restructure its outstanding debt through a prepackaged bankruptcy
proceeding.  As of June 30, 2010, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. had debt
outstanding amounting to approximately $1.6 billion.


Ratings actions have had a significant impact on Ambac Assurance's ability
to compete in the financial guarantee business.  As a result of the rating
agency actions described above, as well as significant disruption in the capital
markets and investor concern, Ambac Assurance has been able to write only a
limited amount of new financial guarantee business since November 2007.  Ambac
Assurance had been working with rating agencies and regulators to launch
Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. (doing business as Connie Lee Insurance
Company in all states except Wisconsin), a wholly-owned but insulated subsidiary
of Ambac Assurance.  The new company had been designed to have segregated
capital, separate risk management and a


-15-





separate board of directors.  On June 1, 2009, however, management announced
that it postponed its plan to establish the municipal-only financial guarantee
company.  On January 25, 2011, the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of
Insurance announced confirmation of its plan of rehabilitation for the
segregated account of Ambac Assurance.  The segregated account was established
by Ambac Assurance on March 24, 2010, to segregate certain liabilities that
presented serious financial hazards to the company and its policyholders.  As of
October 2010, approximately 700 in-force policies covering a net par outstanding
amount of approximately $50 billion were held in the segregated account.


As of September 30, 2012, Ambac Assurance had net admitted assets of
approximately $6.4 billion and total liabilities of approximately $6.3 billion,
as compared to approximately $7.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, as of
December 31, 2011.  Statutory surplus was approximately $100.0 million and
$495.3 million at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
Statutory net income/(loss) for Ambac Assurance was approximately $702.9 million
and $(835.8) million for September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2011,
respectively.


Ambac Assurance is subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the
States of Wisconsin and New York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is

At March 31, 2008, BHAC had surplus as regards policyholders of slightly
less than $1,000,000,000, determined in accordance with statutory accounting
practices ("SAP") prescribed or permitted by the New York Department of

Standard & Poor's has assigned its "AA+" financial strength and financial
enhancement ratings to BHAC.  Standard & Poor's has assigned its "AA+" financial
enhancement rating to Columbia.  The ratings on BHAC are based on a guaranty
from Columbia in favor of BHAC.  The guaranty issued by Columbia applies to
BHAC's policy issued with respect to the bonds.  Any explanation of these
ratings may only be obtained from Standard & Poor's.  The ratings are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold the bonds, and are subject to revision or
withdrawal at any time by Standard & Poor's. Any downward revision or withdrawal
of a rating may have an adverse effect on the market price of the bonds.


In addition, Moody's has assigned its "Aa1" insurance financial strength
ratings to BHAC and Columbia.  Any explanation of these ratings may only be
obtained from Moody's.  The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold the bonds, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by
Moody's.  Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an adverse
effect on the market price of the bonds.  On April 8, 2009, the date that
Moody's

Investor Services, Inc. assigned its rating to BHAC, BHAC's ultimate parent
company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., maintained an investment in Moody's Investor
Services, Inc.'s parent company of approximately 19.6% of the common shares then
outstanding.  BHAC does not guarantee the market price or investment value of
the bonds nor does it guarantee that the ratings on the bonds will not be

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG").  CIFG, a New York corporation,
and CIFG Europe provide financial guarantees for transactions in the public
finance, structured finance, and infrastructure finance markets in the United
States, Europe and around the world.


On November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded its rating of CIFG to Ca from Caa2
with a developing outlook and simultaneously withdrew any future ratings for
business reasons.  Moody's stated that material deterioration in CIFG's insured
portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile and that
CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources to pay all insurance
claims.  CIFG reported a $298 million statutory deficit in its second quarter
2009 financial statements, increasing its gross loss reserves by $339 million
due to worsening performance trends.  Moody's added that the risk of regulatory
intervention is meaningful given CIFG's failure to meet minimum regulatory
capital requirements.  This could influence the pace of commutations with
counterparties, potentially on terms that imply a distressed exchange, Moody's
cautioned.  On June 15, 2009, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on CIFG from
BB to CC with a negative outlook.  The ratings actions were prompted by
significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured portfolio since
January 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring.  Standard & Poor's
withdrew its rating of CIFG at the request of CIFG on February 16, 2010.  None
of these reporting agencies had reinstated their ratings of CIFG as of January
10, 2013.


As of September 20, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets and total
liabilities of approximately $742.3 million and $385.5 million, respectively as
compared to approximately $707.5 million and $123.0 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2011.  Surplus as regards policyholders was approximately $356.8
million as of September 20, 2012 and $584.5 million as of December 31, 2011.

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC").  FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation.  The company provides financial guaranty
insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for public finance and
structured finance obligations.  FGIC typically guarantees the scheduled
payments of principal and interest on an issuer's obligations when due.


-19-





FGIC is licensed to write financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
and, through a branch, the United Kingdom.


The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets adversely affected FGIC's business, results of operations, and
financial condition.  During 2008, FGIC's financial strength and credit ratings
were downgraded by various rating agencies.  The financial strength ratings
downgrades have adversely impacted the company's ability to generate new
business and, unless restored, will impact the future business, operations and
financial results.  As a result of these developments, the company ceased
writing new business to preserve capital.  On September 30, 2008, FGIC entered
into a reinsurance agreement with MBIA under which MBIA reinsured certain
policies covering approximately $166 billion of FGIC's U.S. public finance
insured par outstanding.  The reinsurance provided by MBIA was to enable covered
policyholders to make claims for payment directly against MBIA in accordance
with the terms of the reinsurance agreement.


On November 24, 2009, the New York Insurance Department issued an order
requiring FGIC to cease writing new policies and suspend paying any and all
claims because of ongoing surplus to policyholders deficits and impairment of
required minimum surplus to policyholders.  The order required FGIC to provide a
detailed and final restructuring plan no later than January 5, 2010.  To satisfy
this requirement, FGIC provided to the New York Insurance Department FGIC's
proposed surplus restoration plan, which, as of February 1, 2010, was under
review.  The order further required FGIC to return to compliance with regulatory
requirements by March 25, 2010, which was subsequently extended to June 15,
2010.  FGIC announced on May 14, 2010, as part of its surplus restoration plan,
its plans to participate in an offer to exchange certain residential mortgage-
backed securities and asset-backed securities insured by FGIC for cash and
uninsured securities by Sharps SP I LLC.  On October 25, 2010, Sharps SP I LLC
announced that it did not receive sufficient participation from eligible holders
in its offer to exchange certain residential mortgage-backed securities and
asset-backed securities insured by FGIC to satisfy the conditions necessary to
complete the exchange offer.  As a result, the conditions for successfully
effectuating FGIC's surplus restoration plan had not been satisfied.  On
December 2, 2010, FGIC announced that investors holding securities guaranteed by
FGIC formed a policyholder group in light of the unsuccessful exchange offer.
The purpose of the policyholder group was to negotiate a proposed restructuring
plan with FGIC, which FGIC would submit to the New York Superintendent of
Insurance by January 31, 2011.


On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation, FGIC's parent company, announced it
had filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of New York.  On March 25, 2010, FGIC
and its subsidiary, FGIC Credit Products LLC, entered into a commitment and
support agreement with seven counterparties to their credit default swaps.  This
agreement would enable FGIC to mitigate its potential existing exposure to
material claims based on mark-to-market termination payments under such credit
default swaps.  Under this agreement, the counterparties have agreed to forbear
from exercising certain acceleration, termination, and assessment rights under
their credit default swap contracts for a period of time.  This agreement also
involves FGIC forming a new wholly owned subsidiary


-20-





licensed as a New York financial guaranty insurance corporation that would
assume FGIC's rights, obligations, and liabilities under the specified credit
default swap policies.


On June 11, 2012, FGIC announced that the Superintendent of the New York
State Department of Financial Services filed a verified petition with the
Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order of rehabilitation (i)
appointing the Superintendent as rehabilitator of FGIC; (ii) directing the
rehabilitator to take possession of the property and assets of FGIC and to
conduct its business; and (iii) directing the rehabilitator to take steps toward
removing the causes and conditions which have made the rehabilitation proceeding
necessary. FGIC has consented to the commencement of the rehabilitation
proceeding.


On April 22, 2009, Standard and Poor's lowered its rating of FGIC to CC
from CCC with a negative outlook, and subsequently withdrew its ratings because
of an expectation that timely financial information would no longer be
available.  On March 24, 2009, FGIC was downgraded to Caa3 from Caa1 with a
negative outlook by Moody's, which also announced that it was withdrawing the
ratings of FGIC and FGIC Corporation for business reasons.  Effective November
24, 2008, Fitch no longer provides a rating for FGIC, citing its belief that
FGIC's financial guaranty franchise was effectively in run-off and, as a result,
that there was limited investor interest in continued coverage of the rating.
Prior to January 2008, FGIC was rated AAA, Aaa and AAA by Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, and Fitch, respectively.  None of these reporting agencies had
reinstated their ratings of FGIC as of January 10, 2013.


As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had total admitted assets of approximately
$2.1 billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.  At year end
2011, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1 billion and total
liabilities of approximately $5.6 billion.  For the quarter ended September 30,
2012, FGIC had net income/(loss) of approximately $4.3 million.  On December 31,
2011, FGIC had net income/(loss) of approximately $(1.2) billion.  As of
September 30, 2012, FGIC's statutory surplus/(deficit) was approximately $(3.7)
billion compared to a statutory surplus/(deficit) of approximately $(3.6)
billion on December 31, 2011.  As discussed above, due to this statutory
deficit, FGIC is suspended by the New York State Insurance Department from
writing new policies and paying all claims.

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National").  National is an
insurance subsidiary of MBIA, Inc., a Connecticut corporation.  On February 25,
2008, MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA") announced a plan to implement several
initiatives in connection with the restructuring of its business over the next
few years.  A significant aspect of the plan was the


-21-





creation of separate legal operating entities for MBIA's public, structured, and
asset management businesses as soon as feasible, with a goal of within five
years.  As part of that plan, on February 18, 2009, MBIA announced it had formed
a new public finance-only financial guarantee insurance company which would
conduct business only in the United States.  The new company initially did
business as MBIA Illinois, but changed its name to National Public Finance
Guarantee Corporation officially on March 19, 2009.  Its initial portfolio of
approximately $537 billion in net par outstanding as of February 18, 2009
consisted of both the U.S. public finance policies originally insured by MBIA
and those reinsured as part of a 2008 portfolio transaction with FGIC.  All of
the existing affected policyholders were to have reinsurance provided by
National through the cut-through provision in the reinsurance agreement and
second-to-pay policies, which gave MBIA and FGIC policyholders the ability to
make a claim for payment directly against National.


On December 19, 2011, Moody's lowered its rating on National to Baa2 with a
negative outlook.  As of January 10, 2013, National has maintained this rating.
On December 22, 2010, Standard and Poor's lowered its rating on National to BBB
with a developing outlook.  As of January 10, 2013, National has maintained this
rating.


As of September 30, 2012, National's total net admitted assets were
approximately $5.9 billion and its total liabilities were approximately $4.1
billion, as compared to approximately $6.7 billion and $5.2 billion,
respectively, as of December 31, 2011.  The surplus as regards policyholders was
approximately $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2012, and $1.4 billion as of
December 31, 2011.  As of September 30, 2012, National had a net income/(loss)
of $270.0 million, compared with a net income/(loss) of $477.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2011.

Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian").  Radian Group Inc. is a global
credit risk management company headquartered in Philadelphia with significant
operations in New York and London.


On November 17, 20122, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Radian to B+
with a negative outlook, which remains its rating as of January 10, 2013.  On
April 17, 2012, Moody's affirmed its Ba1 rating with a negative outlook, which
remains its rating as of January 10, 2013.  Radian Group Inc.'s management has
stated that it has discontinued, for the foreseeable future, writing any new
financial guaranty business in light of current market conditions, and that it
intends to utilize Radian's available capital to support its mortgage insurance
operations.  Radian has also announced that it and Assured Guaranty Corp.
("Assured") entered into a transaction whereby Radian reinsured a group of
public finance policies with Assured.  As part of that


-22-





reinsurance transaction, Radian has appointed Assured to service those insurance
policies, effective as of January 24, 2012.


As of September 30, 2012, Radian Asset Assurance maintained claims paying
resources of $1.8 billion, including statutory surplus of approximately $1.1
billion.

Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.) ("Syncora").
Syncora is the sole subsidiary of Syncora Holdings Ltd., a holding company
domiciled in Bermuda, and provides financial guarantee insurance and other
credit enhancement for debt obligations in the U.S. and international capital
markets, including municipal bonds, asset-backed securities, debt backed by
utilities and selected infrastructure projects, future flow securitizations,
bank deposit insurance and collateralized debt obligations.


On November 8, 2012, Moody's withdrew its rating of Syncora, citing a lack
of adequate information to support the maintenance of a rating.  Syncora had
previously been rated Ca by Moody's.  On July 28, 2010, Standard & Poor's
withdrew its rating of Syncora.  A press release stated that this was due to a
lack of sufficient information to judge the company's claims paying ability.
Syncora had previously been given an "R" rating due to being under regulatory
supervision.  Neither reporting agency had reinstated its ratings of Syncora as
of January 10, 2013.


In its year-end 2008 annual statement, Syncora reported a statutory
policyholders' deficit of approximately $2.4 billion, which would permit the New
York Insurance Department to intervene in Syncora's operations and seek court
appointment as rehabilitator or liquidator of the company.  Syncora then engaged
in settlement negotiations with its counterparties and launched a tender offer
for insured residential mortgage-backed securities as part of a broader
restructuring initiative.  On July 17, 2009, Syncora announced that it completed
substantially all of the steps of its comprehensive restructuring contemplated
by the master transaction agreement between Syncora and certain financial
counterparties to its credit default swap and financial guarantee policies and
accepted the tender offer for certain residential mortgage-backed securities
insured by Syncora.  As a result, the company expected to remediate its
policyholders' surplus deficit in the range of $3.9 and $4.1 billion.  The
restructuring was to relieve the company of approximately $6.0 billion in losses
and loss reserves.  The company expected that the successful remediation of its
policyholders' surplus deficit would allow it to return to compliance with the
New York State Insurance Department's minimum policyholders' surplus requirement
of $65 million.  Syncora is not currently writing new insurance business and,
along with its newly formed financial guarantee insurance subsidiary, Syncora
Capital Assurance Inc., will not resume writing new insurance business.  The New
York State Insurance Department approved the transactions relating to the
restructuring and directed that, upon the completion of each of the


-23-





transactions so approved, the company would confirm that such closings have
occurred and the impairment to its policyholders' surplus had been removed.


On April 12, 2010, Syncora reported that it had closed the outstanding
transaction that was part of its restructuring that was announced on July 17,
2007.  On July 20, 2010, Syncora announced that it completed its remediation
plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory policyholder surplus requirements
and address previously announced short and medium term liquidity issues.  The
remediation plan included purchases of certain of the company's guaranteed
exposures, monetization of certain of its illiquid assets, receipt of a partial
prepayment of a surplus note from its wholly owned subsidiary Syncora Capital
Assurance Inc. and various other loss remediation and restructuring actions.
Syncora also announced that, as required by a supplemental order issued by the
New York Insurance Department on June 17, 2010, the company provided, and the
New York Insurance Department approved, Syncora's plan for the payment of new
claims as they become due in the ordinary course of business and for the payment
of claims accrued and unpaid since April 26, 2009.  On October 25, 2010, Syncora
announced that it would record a decrease in its statutory policyholders'
surplus of approximately $25 million to $40 million for the third quarter of
2010, principally as a result of adverse development with respect to residential
mortgage backed securities and other guaranteed transactions.  In connection
with the adverse development of its reserves, Syncora identified a potential
mismatch of future long-term claim payments and reimbursement of such claim
payments and warned that such mismatch might impact liquidity at that time.  If
not mitigated, the company warned, these issues could materially impair
Syncora's ability to satisfy its future obligations.  In addition, Syncora
announced that it expected the discount rate used in the calculation of its
reserves and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2010 to be lower, as
compared to that used in prior periods during 2010 and as of December 31, 2009.
The company warned that a decrease in this rate will cause Syncora's reserves
and loss adjustment expenses to increase and such increase may have a material
adverse effect on the company's policyholders' surplus.


Syncora's total assets and total liabilities as of September 30, 2012 were
approximately $1.1 billion and $639.2 million, respectively, as compared to
approximately $833.7 million and $647.6 million, respectively, as of December
31, 2011.  The surplus as regards policyholders was approximately $504.2 million
as of September 30, 2012, and $186.0 million as of December 31, 2011.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST



DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Interest received by a trust, including any
portion of the proceeds from a disposition of securities which represents
accrued interest, is credited by the trustee to the Interest Account for the
trust.  All other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate Principal
Account for the trust.  The trustee normally has no cash for distribution to
unitholders until it receives interest payments on the securities in the trust.
On the dates set forth under "Essential Information" in the prospectus, the
trustee will commence distributions, in part from funds advanced by the trustee.


Thereafter, assuming the trust retains its original size and composition,
after deduction of the fees and expenses and reimbursements (without interest)
to the trustee for any amounts advanced to a trust, the trustee will normally
distribute any income and principal received by the trust on each distribution
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding Record
Date.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata
share of the balance of the Interest Account.  However, interest earned at any
point in time will generally be greater than the amount actually received by the
trustee.  Therefore, there will generally remain an item of accrued interest
that is added to the daily value of the units.  If unitholders sell or redeem
all or a portion of their units, they will be paid their proportionate share of
the accrued interest to, but not including, the third business day after the
date of a sale or to the date of tender in the case of a redemption.


Unitholders of record on the first record date will receive an interest
distribution on the first distribution date.  Because the period of time between
the first distribution date and the regular distribution dates may not be a full
period, the first regular distributions may be partial distributions.


Persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date
will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date following
their purchase of units.  Since interest on securities in the trust is payable
at varying intervals and distributions are made to unitholders at different
intervals from receipt of interest, the interest accruing to a trust may not be
equal to the amount of money received and available for distribution from the
Interest Account.  Therefore, on each distribution date the amount of interest
actually deposited in the Interest Account and available for distribution may be
slightly more or less than the interest distribution made.  In order to
eliminate fluctuations in interest distributions resulting from such variances,
the trustee is authorized by the trust agreement to advance such amounts as may
be necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts.
The trustee will be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from
funds available in the Interest Account.


The trustee will distribute on each distribution date or shortly
thereafter, to each unitholder of record on the preceding record date, an amount
substantially equal to such holder's pro rata share of the available cash
balance, if any, in the Principal Account computed as of the


-25-





close of business on the preceding record date.  However, no distribution will
be required if the balance in the Principal Account is less than $1.00 per unit.


STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.


The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:


(A)  As to the Interest Account:


(1) Income received;


(2) Deductions for applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the trust
and for redemptions of units, if any; and


(3) The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar
amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; and


(B)  As to the Principal Account:


(1) The dates of disposition of any securities and the net proceeds
received therefrom;


(2) Deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and expenses of
the trust and for redemptions of units, if any; and


(3) The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed
both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the
pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last business day of
such calendar year; and


(C)  The following information:


(1) A list of the securities as of the last business day of such calendar
year;


(2) The number of units outstanding on the last business day of such
calendar year;


(3) The redemption price based on the last evaluation made during such
calendar year;


-26-





(4) The amount actually distributed during such calendar year from the
Interest and Principal Accounts separately stated, expressed both as
total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit outstanding on the
record dates for each such distribution.


RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.


AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be
amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as

(1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the
acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the
schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the
holders of which are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The
trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the interest in a trust
represented by units without the consent of all affected    unitholders.  Except
for the amendments, changes or modifications described above, neither the
sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment, change or
modification of the trust agreement without the giving of notice and the
obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may
reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are required to
consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without
the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the
affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter
the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee
with the power to engage in business or investment activities other than as
specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax
status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the units being
deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal
income tax purposes, result in a variation of the investment of unitholders in
the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of the substance of any such
amendment.


The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the
maturity, liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the
securities held in the trust but in no event is it to


-27-





continue beyond the mandatory termination date.  If the value of a trust shall
be less than the applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus (generally
40% of the total value of securities deposited in the trust during the initial
offering period), the trustee may, in its discretion, and shall, when so
directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.  A trust may be terminated at any
time by the holders of units representing 66 2/3% of the units thereof then
outstanding.    A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a
sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than
40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.
If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the
sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee
paid by such purchaser.


Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof (upon surrender
for cancellation of certificates for units, if issued) their pro rata share of
the balances remaining in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the trust.


THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject
to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of
New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.


Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.


The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.


-28-





In case at any time the trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the
trust agreement, or shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having
jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect
of the trustee in an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary
case, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator (or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part
of its property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay
its debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for
the trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the
sponsor, or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred
either (1) a material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or

(2) one or more grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect
to a trust, the sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the
trustee and appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written
instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and
appointment shall be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution
of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.


THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
The sponsor is a broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-
dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other financial
professionals. The sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,
Monument, Colorado 80132. You can contact the Advisor's Asset Management
division at 8100 East 22nd Street North, Building 800, Suite 102, Wichita,
Kansas 67226 or by using the contacts listed on the back cover of the
prospectus. The sponsor is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser and
a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and a registrant of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).


If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the
trust agreement.


THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor
or trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.


-29-





LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale
of any securities.


The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
trustee.


The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided,
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its
obligations under the trust agreement.


EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.


The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Principal and Interest Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest
bearing and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part
of the trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result
from the use of these funds.


The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate
cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any
annual period, except


-30-





during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units
outstanding at the end of each month.


For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at
the end of each month.


For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units
outstanding at the end of each month.


The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are
deducted from the Interest Account of the related trust to the extent funds are
available and then from the Principal Account.  Each such fee may be increased
without approval of unitholders by amounts not exceeding a proportionate
increase in the Consumer Price Index or any equivalent index substituted
therefor.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust:

(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;

(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;

(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust
agreement; (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon termination
of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of a trust
and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the trust.  If the
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for
amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell securities to
pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or losses to
unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement
each year.


-31-









PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS



PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  During the initial offering period, the public offering price
per unit is equal to the net asset value per unit (generally based on the
offering side evaluations of the securities) plus the applicable sales fee
referred to in the prospectus.  The public offering price for secondary market
transactions is based on the net asset value per unit (generally based on the
bid side evaluations of the securities).  Certain broker-dealers may charge a
transaction fee for processing unit purchases.


The evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the
underlying securities as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and will adjust the public
offering price of the units commensurate with such valuation.  Such public
offering price will be effective for all orders received at or prior to the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each such day.
Orders received by the trustee, sponsor or any dealer for purchases, sales or
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is
closed, will be held until the next determination of price.


The public offering price per unit of the trust as shown under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus as of the date stated therein or on any
subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential Information"
in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the
underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units.  Net
asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trust's portfolio
securities (including any accrued interest), cash and other assets, less all
liabilities (including accrued expenses), by the total number of units
outstanding.  The portfolio securities are valued at their current market value
or their fair value as determined in good faith by the Evaluator.  The aggregate
bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined (a) on
the basis of current bid or offering prices of the securities, (b) if bid or
offering prices are not available for any particular security, on the basis of
current bid or offering prices for comparable securities, (c) by determining the
value of securities on the bid or offer side of the market by appraisal, or

(d) by any combination of the above.


The interest on the securities deposited in a trust, less the related
estimated fees and expenses, will accrue daily.  The amount of net interest
income which accrues per unit may change as securities mature or are redeemed,
exchanged or sold, or as the expenses of a trust change or the number of
outstanding units of a trust changes.


Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  If a unitholder desires to have certificates representing
units purchased, such certificates will be delivered as soon as possible
following his written request therefor.


-32-





ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest
on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.  Interest on
securities generally is paid monthly or semi-annually although a trust accrues
such interest daily.  Because of this, a trust always has an amount of interest
earned but not yet collected by the trustee.  For this reason, the public
offering price of units of a trust will have added to it the proportionate share
of accrued interest to the date of settlement.  Unitholders will receive on the
next distribution date of a trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid
on their units.


In an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise
have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to
the public, the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the
first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the
unitholder of record as of the first settlement date.  Consequently, the amount
of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will
include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of
settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the
first settlement date.


Because of the varying interest payment dates of securities, accrued
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest
actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders.
Therefore, there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to
the value of the units.  If a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of
his units, he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued
interest from the purchaser of his units.  Since the trustee has the use of the
funds held in the Interest Account for distributions to unitholders and since
such account is non-interest-bearing to unitholders, the trustee benefits
thereby.


COMPARISON OF PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE AND REDEMPTION PRICE.  The net asset
value of units will generally be determined on the basis of the current bid
prices of the securities.


PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and through others.
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not
change the price you pay for your units.


The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.


-33-





PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the
cost of such securities to a trust, which is based on the offering side
evaluation of the securities.  The sponsor may also realize profits or losses
with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily evaluation of the
securities in a trust.


MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said
units at the net asset value, determined by the evaluator based on the aggregate
bid prices of the underlying securities in the trust, together with any accrued
interest to the expected dates of settlement.  Unitholders who wish to dispose
of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in
order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the
redemption price and, if so, the amount thereof.


The offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord
with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units.
Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the
sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market, it may suspend
or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds
demand, or for other business reasons.


REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by tendering such certificate
to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee.  Unitholders must
sign the request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing
the units to be redeemed.  If the amount of the redemption is $500 or less and
the proceeds are payable to the unitholder(s) of record at the address of
record, no signature guarantee is necessary for redemptions by individual
account owners (including joint owners).  Additional documentation may be
requested, and a signature guarantee is always required, from corporations,
executors, administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures
must be guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion
Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.  A certificate
should only be sent by registered or certified mail for the protection of the
unitholder.  Since tender of the certificate is required for redemption when one
has been issued, units represented by a certificate cannot be redeemed until the
certificate representing such units has been received by the purchasers.


-34-





Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of
redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing
redemption requests.


Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances the
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of a trust to
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Principal Account for a trust.


The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold,
the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust may be, reduced but
each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same
proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a time when
securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be more or less
than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities
in the portfolio at the time of redemption.


The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of
the redemption price.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;

(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying


-35-





securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.


COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units (the net
asset value) of each trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation
time stated in the prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for
redemption and on any other business day desired by it, by:


A.   adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the
trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such
securities; (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities
(including "when issued" contracts, if any) held in the trust as determined
by the evaluator on the basis of bid prices therefor; and (3) interest
accrued and unpaid on the securities in the trust as of the date of
computation;


B.   deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or
governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve
Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses of the
trust, including but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing fees and any insurance costs), the evaluator,
the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash held for distribution to
unitholders of record as of the business day prior to the evaluation being
made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the trust; and


C.   finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.


RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust may lower the
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts. Fees and charges with respect
to such plans may vary.


OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by
certificates unless a unitholder, the unitholder's registered broker/dealer or
the clearing agent for such broker/dealer makes a written request to the
trustee.  Units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by presenting and surrendering
such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer which should be sent by registered or
certified mail for the protection of the unitholder.  Unitholders must sign such
written request, and such certificate or transfer


-36-





instrument, exactly as their names appear on the records of the trustee and on
any certificate representing the units to be transferred.  Such signatures must
be guaranteed as described above.


Units may be purchased and certificates, if requested, will be issued in
denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof, subject to the minimum
investment requirement.  Fractions of units, if any, will be computed to three
decimal places.  Any certificate issued will be numbered serially for
identification, issued in fully registered form and will be transferable only on
the books of the trustee.  The trustee may require a unitholder to pay a
reasonable fee, to be determined in the sole discretion of the trustee, for each
certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with each such transfer or interchange.  The trustee at
the present time does not intend to charge for the normal transfer or
interchange of certificates.  Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost certificates
will be replaced upon delivery to the trustee of satisfactory indemnity
(generally amounting to 3% of the market value of the units), affidavit of loss,
evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred.



TAXATION



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning your trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of
trust units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of trust units, as well
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S.
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.


If so indicated in the prospectus, your trust intends (i) to elect and (ii)
to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the Code and to
comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal
income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,

(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year,

(i) at least 50% of the market value of the trust's assets is represented by
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with
such


-37-





other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this
calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the trust's total
assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such
issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested
in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of
other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or more issuers
which the trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or related trades
or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded partnerships; and

(c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which
includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net short-term capital
gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes net capital gain,
if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income each taxable
year.


As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their
proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the
current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in October, November or
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to
unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.


If your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income
were distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income.

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION



INTEREST, ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RETURN AND ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN.  As of
the close of business on the business day before the trust's inception date, the
estimated long-term return and the estimated current return, if applicable, for
each trust were as set forth in the "Essential Information" for each trust in
the prospectus.  Estimated current return is calculated by dividing the
estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price.  The
estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and
expenses of the trustee, the sponsor and the evaluator and with the principal
prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of the securities while the
public offering price will vary with changes in the offering price of the
underlying securities and accrued interest; therefore, there is no assurance
that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future.
Estimated long-term return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into
consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the
market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements or average life of all of
the securities in a trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales fee
associated with each trust unit.  Since the market values and estimated
retirements of the securities and the expenses of a trust will change, there is
no assurance that the present estimated long-term return will be realized in the
future.  Estimated current return and estimated long-term return are expected to
differ because the calculation of estimated long-term return reflects the
estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return
calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price.


GENERAL.  Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the
prospectus, as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included
from time to time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information
on the performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may
be included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and
may reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc. (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of 30
widely traded industrial common stocks) or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (an
unmanaged diversified index of 500 stocks) or similar measurement standards
during the same period of time.



DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES RATINGS



STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &
Poor's issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an
obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of
financial obligations, or a specific financial program (including ratings on
medium-term note programs and commercial paper programs). It


-39-





takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other
forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the
currency in which the obligation is denominated. The issue credit rating is not
a recommendation to purchase, sell, or hold a financial obligation, inasmuch as
it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


Issue credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the
obligors or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers
reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any
credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.
Credit ratings may be changed, suspended, or withdrawn as a result of changes
in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other circumstances.


Issue credit ratings can be either long term or short term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in the
relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an
original maturity of no more than 365 days, including commercial paper. Short-
term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with
respect to put features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual rating,
in which the short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the
usual long-term rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.



Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings



Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


*  Likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its
financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the
obligation;


*  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


*  Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the
event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the laws of
bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The issue rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated 'AAA' has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated 'AA' differs from the highest-rated obligations only to
a small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


-40-





A--An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-
rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.



BB, B, CCC, CC, and C



Obligations rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC', and 'C' are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree of
speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


BB--An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.


B--An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations
rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.


CCC--An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely
to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.


CC--An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.


C--A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated 'C' is currently
highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The 'C' rating may be used to cover a situation
where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken, but payments
on this obligation are being continued. A 'C' also will be assigned to a
preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments, but that
is currently paying.


D--An obligation rated 'D' is in payment default. The 'D' rating category is
used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that
such payments will be made during such grace period. The 'D' rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action
if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.


-41-





Plus (+) or minus (-)--The ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the
addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the
major rating categories.


N.R.--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.



Active Qualifiers (Currently applied and/or outstanding)



i--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, terms, or
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood
of receipt of principal on the obligation. The 'i' subscript indicates that the
rating addresses the interest portion of the obligation only. The 'i' subscript
will always be used in conjunction with the 'p' subscript, which addresses
likelihood of receipt of principal. For example, a rated obligation could be
assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.


L--Ratings qualified with 'L' apply only to amounts invested up to federal
deposit insurance limits.


p--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, the terms, or
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood
of receipt of interest on the obligation. The 'p' subscript indicates that the
rating addresses the principal portion of the obligation only. The 'p' subscript
will always be used in conjunction with the 'i' subscript, which addresses
likelihood of receipt of interest. For example, a rated obligation could be
assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.


pi--Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are based on an analysis of an issuer's
published financial information, as well as additional information in the public
domain. They do not, however, reflect in-depth meetings with an issuer's
management and are therefore based on less comprehensive information than
ratings without a 'pi' subscript. Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are reviewed
annually based on a new year's financial statements, but may be reviewed on an
interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuer's credit
quality.


pr--The letters 'pr' indicate that the rating is provisional. A provisional
rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt
being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely
or entirely dependent upon the successful, timely completion of the project.
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion
of the project, makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default
upon failure of such completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment
with respect to such likelihood and risk.


t--This symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their
contracts to full maturity or, should certain events occur, to terminate and
cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. Long-Term Obligation Ratings



Moody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit
risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more.
They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as
promised. Such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial
loss suffered in the event of default.



Long-Term Rating Definitions:



Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal
credit risk.


Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.


A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low
credit risk.


Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.


Ba--Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject
to substantial credit risk.


B--Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit
risk.


Caa--Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to
very high credit risk.


Ca--Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near,
default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.


C--Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in
default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation
ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates
a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of
that generic rating category.



Medium-Term Note Ratings



Moody's assigns long-term ratings to individual debt securities issued from
medium-term note (MTN) programs, in addition to indicating ratings to MTN
programs themselves. Notes issued under MTN programs with such indicated ratings
are rated at issuance at the rating applicable to all pari passu notes issued
under the same program, at the program's relevant indicated rating, provided
such notes do not exhibit any of the characteristics listed below:


-43-





*  Notes containing features that link interest or principal to the credit
performance of any third party or parties


*  Notes allowing for negative coupons, or negative principal


*  Notes containing any provision that could obligate the investor to make any
additional payments


*  Notes containing provisions that subordinate the claim.


For notes with any of these characteristics, the rating of the individual
note may differ from the indicated rating of the program.


Market participants must determine whether any particular note is rated,
and if so, at what rating level. Moody's encourages market participants to
contact Moody's Ratings Desks or visit www.moodys.com directly if they have
questions regarding ratings for specific notes issued under a medium-term note
program. Unrated notes issued under an MTN program may be assigned an NR symbol.

------------------                                                              

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation.                            

 PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The trust invests primarily in common stocks of bank holding companies whose
subsidiary banks are members of the Independent Community Bankers of America    
("ICBA").  Howe Barnes Hoefer & Arnett, Inc. ("Howe Barnes"), selected the      
stocks for the portfolio.  Howe Barnes considered a variety of factors in       
selecting the stocks, including:                                                

*  financial criteria of the company (or its bank or thrift subsidiary);    

*  regulatory capital levels;                                               

*  net interest margins;                                                    

*  return on average assets;                                                

*  return on average equity;                                                

*  adequacy of loan loss reserve;                                           

*  level of non-performing and non-accrual loans; and                       

*  loan charge-off history.                                                 

While many of the stocks pay dividends, Howe Barnes did not specifically    
consider dividend payments in selecting the stocks.

and Howe Barnes, see "Understanding Your Investment--The Trust."
 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  STOCK PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over     
time.                                                                     

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN 
THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur at any point in time, including  
during the initial offering period.                                       

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR  
 MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
in the value of your units.                                               

*  THE TRUST INVESTS EXCLUSIVELY IN COMMON STOCKS OF COMMUNITY BANK HOLDING     
COMPANIES.  Negative developments in the community banking industry will  
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more 
diversified portfolio.                                                    

*  THE TRUST INVESTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN STOCKS OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.   
These stocks are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than  
stocks of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have limited
products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly
available information.                                                    

*  WE<FN1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited            
circumstances, the trust will hold shares of the same stocks even if their
market value declines.  The trust is not managed or supervised by Howe    
Barnes, ICBA Capital Markets, LLC or its affiliates, or any ICBA-related  
entity.

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year                           $378                       
3 years (life of trust)          $437                       

 These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investments at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

 THE TRUST

The trust invests primarily in common stocks of bank holding companies whose
subsidiary banks are members of the ICBA.  Howe Barnes selected the stocks for  
the portfolio.  Howe Barnes considered a variety of factors in selecting the    
stocks, including:                                                              

*  financial criteria of the company (or its bank or thrift subsidiary);    

*  regulatory capital levels;                                               

*  net interest margins;                                                    

*  return on average assets;                                                

*  return on average equity;                                                

*  adequacy of loan loss reserve;                                           

*  level of non-performing and non-accrual loans; and                       

*  loan charge-off history.                                                 

While many of the stocks pay dividends, Howe Barnes did not specifically    
consider dividend payments in selecting the stocks.                             

Howe Barnes feels that the stocks in the portfolio have the potential to    
increase in value over time primarily due to strong or improving fundamental    
characteristics such as:                                                        

*  management strength and depth;                                           

*  strategic banking locations in stable or growing market areas;           

*  strong asset quality; and                                                

*  potential earnings growth.                                               

In addition, continued bank and thrift consolidation may create attractive  
investment opportunities among community bank and thrift stocks.                

 Community banks are independent, locally owned and operated institutions with
assets ranging from less than $10 million to a few billion dollars.  There are  
more than 5,000 community banks, including both commercial banks and savings and
loans.  Community banks often offer comprehensive retail banking services and   
products such as checking and savings products, electronic banking, automated   
teller machines, credit and debit cards, mortgage and consumer loan products,   
investment products, and small business and agricultural lending.  Nearly 1,380 
community bank stocks are currently publicly-traded.                            

The ICBA represents the largest constituency of community banks of all sizes
and charter types in the United States, and is dedicated exclusively to         
protecting the interests of the community banking industry.  ICBA aggregates the
power of its members to provide:  a voice for community banking interests in    
government affairs; resources to enhance community bank education and           
marketability, and; profitability options to help community banks compete in an 
ever-changing marketplace.  With nearly 4,700 members, the ICBA is dedicated    
exclusively to enhancing the franchise value of the nation's community banks for
the benefit of their customers and the communities they serve.                  

ICBA Securities Corporation ("ICBA Securities") is a subsidiary of the ICBA 
Services Network, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the ICBA.  ICBA Securities 
provides sophisticated investment portfolio management assistance to more than  
1,500 community banks.  ICBA Securities is a broker-dealer registered with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission and a member

HOW TO BUY UNITS

 You can buy units of the trust by contacting your financial professional.  It
is anticipated that units will be sold only on the trust's inception date.  Unit
prices are available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public
offering price of units includes:                                               

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  the sales fee.                                                           

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  We must receive your order to buy units     
prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (normally  
4:00 p.m. Eastern time) to give you the price for that day.  If we receive your 
order after this time, you will not receive the price computed on that day.     
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit
purchase orders.                                                                

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this   
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service        
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value 
after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security.  We    
will only

do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities        
exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.              

 We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in
this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the New   
York Stock Exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus.  On 
the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of   
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration     
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later.                                                                       

SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.  We refer to 
this fee as the "sales fee."  The maximum sales fee equals 3.50% of the public  
offering price per unit at the time of purchase.  The sales fee will be reduced 
by 1/2 of 1% on each October 25, commencing October 25, 2008 to a minimum sales 
fee of 2.50% You pay the sales fee at the time you buy units.                   

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.                                              

Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of   
your investment.  If you purchase units in the initial offering period in the   
amount of $500,000 or more on any single day from any one broker-dealer, the    
sales fee is 2.50% of the public offering price per unit.                       

 Fee Accounts.  We waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made through
registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered      
broker-dealers who charge periodic fees in lieu of commissions or who charge for
financial planning or for investment advisory or asset management services or   
provide these services as part of an investment account where a comprehensive   
"wrap fee" is imposed.  You should consult your financial advisor to determine  
whether you can benefit from these accounts.  Fee account purchases may be made 
at the public offering price per unit less the applicable dealer concession.    

 This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary
market.  Certain fee account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees
on the purchase and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other      
processing organizations for providing certain transaction or account           
activities.  We reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in fee    
accounts by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is       
determined to be detrimental to the trust.                                      

Employees.  The sales fee applicable to initial offering period purchases   
made by officers, directors and employees of Howe Barnes and its affiliates and 
their family members (spouses, children and parents) is 1.00% of the public     
offering price per unit.                                                        

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-    
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional 
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your        
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the 
net asset value per unit.  The

P-->4879th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to as the "liquidation price."  
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit
redemption or sale requests.                                                    

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value.  We may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering  
price or redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase 
price is the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also   
maintain a secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial        
professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best price          
available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice. 
Even if we do not make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the 
trustee on any business day for the current redemption price.                   

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.  The      
redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset value
per unit.  The trustee must receive your completed redemption request prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange for you to receive  
the net asset value for a particular day.  If your request is received after    
that time or is incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value
computed after the trustee receives your completed request.                     

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

To redeem your units, you must send the trustee any certificates for your   
units.  You must properly endorse your certificates or sign a written transfer  
instrument with a signature guarantee.  The trustee may require additional      
documents such as a certificate of corporate authority, trust documents, a death
certificate, or an appointment as executor, administrator or guardian.  The     
trustee cannot complete your redemption or send your payment to you until it    
receives all of these documents in complete form.                               

You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your   
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally      
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.  In         
addition, the trustee reserves the right to pay unit redemption proceeds through
an in-kind distribution of securities with respect to redemption requests of    
$100,000 or more.  The trustee will make any in-kind distribution of securities 
by distributing applicable securities in book entry form to the account of your 
financial professional at Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole     
shares of the applicable securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.    
You may not request this option in the last 30 days of your trust's life.  We   
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.                             

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the unitholder requesting an in kind      
distribution is

the sponsor or an affiliated person of the trust, the trustee may make an in    
kind distribution to such unitholder provided that no one with a pecuniary      
incentive to influence the in kind distribution may influence selection of the  
distributed securities, the distribution must consist of a pro rata distribution
of all portfolio securities (with limited exceptions) and the in kind           
distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the detriment of any other 
unitholder.                                                                     

 DISTRIBUTIONS

 DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment
income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of
record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution dates are     
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special distribution if it   
holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  For example, this could
happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose 
stock is in your portfolio.  The trust will also generally make required        
distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each    
year because it is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal   
tax purposes.  The amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as  
companies change their dividends or trust expenses change.                      

ESTIMATED ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual distributions are 
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  We generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive 
on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer (or      
adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign 
issuers) or on scheduled income payments.  However, dividend conventions for    
certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in  
the United States and in certain instances, dividends paid or declared over     
several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions.  Due 
to this and various other factors, actual dividends received by the trust will  
most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income
payments.  The actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with  
changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends received and with the    
sale of securities.                                                             

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each        
distribution.  Each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your 
trust's activity and certain tax information.  You can request copies of        
security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited       
financial statements for your trust, if available.                              

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.  

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to various factors.  These 
can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial                 

                                             Understanding Your Investment     9

P-->48711th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a    
security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you should remember that we 
do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a security solely       
because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.                

DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling 
or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent ownership interests in 
the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.  Common stockholders have a 
right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of   
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  Common stocks do not    
assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's 
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.           

CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more         
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry  
because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry.  A        
portfolio "concentrates" in an industry when stocks in a particular industry    
make up 25% or more of the portfolio.                                           

The trust invests significantly in COMMUNITY BANKS AND THEIR HOLDING        
COMPANIES.  Any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on  
the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries.  You
should understand the risks of this industry before you invest.  These issuers  
face risks related to general economic conditions, volatile interest rates,     
economic recession, competition from other financial services companies,        
government regulation and portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in 
commercial and residential real estate loans.  Changes in interest rates can    
significantly impact the operating results of financial institutions.  Increased
interest rates may increase a bank's interest income but may also increase the  
interest the bank pays on depository accounts and may lead to a decreased demand
for loans.  Lower interest rates may lead to increased prepayments on loans.  If
a loan is paid off early, the lending bank is subject to reinvestment risk to   
the extent that it is unable to reinvest the prepayments at rates which are     
comparable to the rates on the prepaid loans.  Economic conditions in real      
estate markets can also significantly impact banks because they often invest    
substantial assets in loans secured by real estate.                             

Federal and state laws regulate financial institutions extensively.  Any    
increase or change in regulations could adversely affect banks and thrifts.  In 
recent years, however, federal legislation has reduced certain barriers to      
interstate banking and branching by financial institutions.  In addition, the   
Federal Reserve Board has liberalized regulations that limit the ability of non-
bank subsidiaries of banks to engage in securities-related businesses.  This and
any future liberalization of banking regulations could result in increased      
competition which could negatively impact some companies.  Banks also face      
significant competition from other financial companies that offer a broader     
array of products such as securities and brokerage companies, credit unions,    
mortgage banking companies and insurance companies.                             

SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  The trust invests significantly in stocks    
issued by small and mid-size companies.  The share prices of these companies are
often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several       
factors common to many such issuers, including limited trading volumes, products
or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available     
information.

P-->48712th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security.                                     

LEGISLATION OR LITIGATION RISK is the risk that various legislative         
initiatives will be proposed from time to time in the United States and abroad  
which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the 
trust.  In addition, litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities  
or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the     
share prices of these securities.  No one can predict what impact any pending or
threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities.          

NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank 
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

 HOW THE TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Fixed Income Securities, L.P. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and      
supervisor) and The Bank of New York (as trustee).  We provide services to unit 
trusts through our Advisor's Asset Management division.  To create your trust,  
we deposited securities selected by Howe Barnes with the trustee (or contracts  
to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other      
consideration to pay for the securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered   
units of your trust to us.  Each unit represents an undivided interest in the   
assets of your trust.  These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until   
your trust terminates.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the      
trust's inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public  
offering price per unit equals $10.  The number of units and fractional interest
of each unit in the trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any        
adjustment.                                                                     

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, your portfolio will remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will generally   
buy and sell securities:                                                        

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,                           

*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
or                                                                    

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been  
made for a security or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been    
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or     
accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the    
best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to 
unitholders.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will      
either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities  
or property and distribute the proceeds.  If any contract for the purchase of   
securities fails, the sponsor will refund the cash and sales fee attributable to
the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date      
unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested
in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement.  The sponsor   
may direct the reinvestment of security sale                                    

                                            Understanding Your Investment     11

P-->48713th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors     
which, in the opinion of the sponsor, would make retention of the securities    
detrimental to the trust.  In such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated
to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet  
the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trust's inception date.  The     
sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that   
the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

We anticipate that the trust's initial offering will be one day; however, if
we sell additional units we will increase the size of your trust.  If we create 
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio.  When your  
trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You     
could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and        
fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time   
your trust buys the securities.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we   
may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers   
that sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee.               

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect 
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change 
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.      
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this  
agreement.                                                                      

 TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of  
this prospectus.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the
trust is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at  
the time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an    
undue burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in   
your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will        
liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold 
to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust    
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time    
they were deposited in the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales    
charge that you paid.                                                           

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Fixed Income Securities, L.P.     
acting through its Advisor's Asset Management division.  We are a broker-dealer 
specializing in providing trading and support services to broker-dealers,       
registered representatives, investment advisers and other financial

or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust  
without a sponsor, or terminate your trust.                                     

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York is the trustee of your trust with its    
principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place, 12th
Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling the    
telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its unit 
investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some cases   
without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and          
investors.                                                                      

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  Units are available through Howe Barnes or your financial     
professional who delivered this prospectus.  During the initial offering period,
the distribution fee (the broker-dealer concession or agency commission) allowed
to Howe Barnes is 3.20% of the public offering price per unit at the time of the
transaction.  During the initial offering period, the broker-dealer concession  
or agency commission allowed by Howe Barnes to other broker-dealers and selling 
firms is 2.50% of the public offering price per unit at the time of the         
transaction (except in purchases of $500,000 or more where a reduced commission 
may apply).  For secondary market transactions, the distribution fee will be    
3.20% and will reduce by 1/2 of 1% on each October 25, commencing October 25,
2008 to a minimum distribution fee of 2.20%.  No distribution fee is paid to    
broker-dealers or other selling firms in connection with unit sales in          
investment accounts that charge a "wrap fee" or periodic fees for investment    
advisory, financial planning or asset management services in lieu of            
commissions.                                                                    

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the distribution fee.  We reserve the right to change the amount of concessions 
or agency commissions from time to time.                                        

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional   
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this trust and our
other products.  This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of 
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related        
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products.  These arrangements will not  
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not       
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be      
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in     
part.                                                                           

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem

them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create      
units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities   
into the trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio."
 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker-dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions  
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,   
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax         
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be          
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment      
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated     
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's         
distributions into two categories, ordinary income distributions and capital    
gains dividends.  Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your     
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, certain ordinary income 
distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax     
rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term      
capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units.  To determine   
your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate  
your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of   
your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In addition, the trust may
make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus 
will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status of your distributions from
your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in        
additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from your trust that you  
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws may require you to treat
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 
of the previous year.                                                           

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will 
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is   
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.  
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to    
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be     
designated by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.

SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will    
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this    
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to 
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,      
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.   

CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are 
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is    
generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax        
brackets).  These new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable   
years beginning before January 1, 2011.  For later periods, if you are an       
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).  The 
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for    
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the  
same as for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital  
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a       
regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same  
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain     
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are        
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself.  These       
special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from        
regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011.  The trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount
of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is      
eligible for the new capital gains tax rates.                                   

IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances, as described in this   
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of trust securities when you
redeem units or when your trust terminates.  This distribution is subject to    
taxation and you will recognize gain or loss, generally based on the value at   
that time of the securities and the amount of cash received.                    

EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over  
into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and
any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be    
treated as a capital loss.  However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange    
will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced (including 
through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days 
before and ending 30 days after disposition of units or to the extent that the  
unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into an option or contract to
acquire, substantially identical stock or securities.  In such a

case, the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed
loss.                                                                           

DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Generally, expenses incurred by your trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and only your     
share of the trust's net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable     
income to you.  However, if the units of your trust are held by fewer than 500  
unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your trust will generally not be 
able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in your reported    
share of the trust's taxable income being increased by your share of those      
expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution.  In 
this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses; however,      
certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be  
deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  
2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                                   

 FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust 
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to      
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.                   

FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other  
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal     
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust designates as capital 
gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding 
taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However, distributions   
received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly designated by   
the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income   
taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust makes certain       
elections and certain other conditions are met.  In the case of dividends with  
respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to 2008, distributions    
from the trust that are properly designated by the trust as an interest-related 
dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a  
short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net short-term capital 
gain income received by the trust may not be subject to U.S. federal income     
taxes, including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors,  
provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are
met.                                                                            

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.               

16     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->48718th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),      
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the  
sponsor, legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs 
incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.    
Your trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.  
The trustee will generally pay trust expenses from distributions received on the
securities but in some cases may sell securities to pay trust expenses.

ADVISOR'S DISCIPLINED TRUST 175                                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the
trust portfolio on page 4, of Advisor's Disciplined Trust 175, as of October 25,
2007, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial condition is the 
responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is to express an     
opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our audit.            

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public      
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require    
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  The     
trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its   
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit        
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over 
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also   
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as       
evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation.  Our      
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York, trustee, of cash or 
an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities as     
shown in the statement of financial condition as of October 25, 2007.  We       
believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisor's           
Disciplined Trust 175 as of October 25, 2007, in conformity with accounting     
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisor's Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment  
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Fixed Income    
Securities, L.P. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
(as trustee).  The sponsor provides services to unit investment trusts through  
its Advisor's Asset Management division.                                        

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's 
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units, fractional interest of each    
unit in the trust and estimated income distributions per unit will increase or  
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or   
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of 
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with           
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued 
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,  
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the    
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be     
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities  
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts, which  
will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the       
securities in such trust.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each 
unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each     
security.  If the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities,      
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a 
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of  
the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the          
securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.        

The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities   
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the     
trust portfolio.                                                                

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any   
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions 
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.      
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure  
in any of

the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase of any of the    
securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless        
substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are    
reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement,     
refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all       
unitholders on the next distribution date.                                      

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

     The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio
of common stocks of bank holding companies whose subsidiary banks are members of
the Independent Community Bankers of America.  Howe Barnes Hoefer & Arnett,     
Inc., selected the stocks for the portfolio.  There is, of course, no guarantee 
that the trust will achieve its objective.  The prospectus provides additional  
information regarding the trust's objective and investment strategy.            

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in special circumstances as provided in the  
trust agreement.  Thus, the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged   
under normal circumstances.  The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may  
(but need not) direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events    
such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding    
obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other  
such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention
of such securities would be detrimental to the trust.                           

If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,    
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the 
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor 
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee 
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in 
the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.   
The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is
the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the
sponsor, would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In   
such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment  
of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in
the trust on the trust's inception date. The sponsor may also instruct the      
trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to      
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax    
purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.

     The trustee may sell securities, designated by the supervisor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.

P-->48724th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
   In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further    
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to   
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the     
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal  
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of 
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital     
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.                                             

     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the
proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be    
reinvested, no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of
time its present size and composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee     
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.  
In the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a 
trust under a contract ("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under   
the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities           
("Replacement Securities") to make up the original corpus of such trust.        

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The Replacement Securities must be equity securities of 
the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income
tax status of the trust.  Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for a     
trust, the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition 
of the Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date    
which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the      
amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded  
the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are
acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust,  
i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market     
variations to improve a unitholder's investment.                                

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
cash attributable to such Failed Securities not more than 30 days after the date
on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a Replacement         
Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that, at the time of receipt
of such cash, they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities
at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have  
earned for unitholders of such trust.                                           

  In the event that a Replacement Security is not acquired by a trust, the
income for such trust may be reduced.

P-->48725th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be    
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

     MARKET RISK. Because the trust invests in stocks, you should understand the
risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units. These risks include the   
risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the
stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks (and therefore units) will  
fall. Stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements. The  
value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market        
confidence and perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on  
factors including expectations regarding government economic policies,          
inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates
and economic or banking crises. The value of units will fluctuate with the value
of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally
paid for your units. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the       
performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time. Because the  
trust is unmanaged, the Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market      
fluctuations as is common in managed investments. In addition, because some     
trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks, you may encounter greater      
market risk than in a more diversified investment.                              

  DIVIDENDS. Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company. Common stockholders have a right to receive payments
from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors, bondholders or 
preferred stockholders of the company. This means that common stockholders have 
a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of directors declares a  
dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors,      
bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues additional debt     
securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities will have a claim 
against the company's assets before common stockholders if the company declares 
bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued     
first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay   
dividends on its common stock.                                                  

  BANKING INDUSTRY. Your trust is concentrated in securities of issuers in
the banking industry.  Banks and their holding companies are especially subject 
to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real     
estate loans, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.    
Banks are highly dependent on net interest margin. Bank profits have come under 
pressure as net interest margins have contracted. There is no certainty that    
such conditions will continue. Banks receive significant consumer mortgage fee  
income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. If initial    
home purchasing and refinancing activity were to subside as a result of         
increasing interest rates and other factors, this income would diminish.        
Economic conditions in the real estate markets, which have been weak in the     
past, can have a

substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their    
assets invested in loans secured by real estate.                                

Banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal    
regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation 
as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on 
the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore,
bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their        
supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the        
permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant
risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit 
insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital    
requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums    
required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance       
Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a       
company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental
regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their   
holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in the securities  
issued by such institutions.                                                    

  The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in the past. To a great extent, these changes are  
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,    
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The Gramm-Leach-   
Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks, securities firms   
and insurance companies to form one-stop financial conglomerates marketing a    
wide range of financial service products to investors. This legislation will    
likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among     
existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to liberalize interstate
banking has also been enacted. Under the legislation, banks are able to purchase
or establish subsidiary banks in any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been     
allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation may continue. The   
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed   
rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading     
accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in 
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated       
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and    
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory         
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act 
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as  
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the securities in the    
trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system  
is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that    
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited  
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits   
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as          
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and          

 -6-

increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and    
national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation      
allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited 
state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit.   
The sponsor makes no prediction as to what, if any, manner of bank regulatory   
actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might  
have on the trust's portfolio.                                                  

 The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

   The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. The sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect, if any, such    
laws will have on the securities or whether such approvals, if necessary, will  
be obtained.                                                                    

 SMALL-CAP AND MID-CAP COMPANIES. Small and mid-size company stocks have
customarily involved more investment risk than large company stocks. Small and  
mid-size companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial         
resources; may lack management depth or experience; and may be more vulnerable  
to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies. Some of
these companies may distribute, sell or produce products which have recently    
been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel.                   

     The prices of small and mid-size company securities are often more volatile
than prices associated with large company issues, and can display abrupt or     
erratic movements at times, due to limited trading volumes and less publicly    
available information. Also, because small and mid-size companies normally have 
fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large      
companies, it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities 
to buy

and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on    
prevailing market prices.                                                       

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase
of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and
other acquisition costs.                                                        

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

  DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account for the trust.  All other receipts are        
credited by the trustee to a separate Capital Account for the trust.  The       
trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each         
distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the         
preceding record date. The trust will also generally make required distributions
or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has   
elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax         
purposes.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro  
rata share of the available balance of the Income Account of the trust.  All    
distributions will be net of applicable expenses.  There is no assurance that   
any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used  
to pay expenses.  In addition, excess amounts from the Capital Account of a     
trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of 
record.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a
record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the    
Capital Account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable 
to the Capital Account.  The trustee shall be required to make a distribution   
from the Capital Account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for   
distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least $0.01 per unit.  The    
trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Capital or Income  
Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the  
use of such funds).                                                             

    The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an   
amount substantially equal to the unitholders' pro rata share of the available  
balance of the Income Account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses.  
Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the 
year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate.  Persons who 
purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person     
becomes a record owner.  A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a 
unitholder of record, on the date of settlement provided payment has been       
received.  Notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the          
responsibility of the purchaser, but in the normal course of business the       
selling broker-dealer provides such notice.                                     

 The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account of
a trust amounts necessary to pay the                                            

 -8-

P-->48729th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
expenses of the trust.  The trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such   
amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any           
governmental charges payable out of a trust.  Amounts so withdrawn shall not be 
considered a part of a trust's assets until such time as the trustee shall      
return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts.  In         
addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and Capital Accounts of a    
trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units.           

 DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT.  Unitholders may reinvest distributions into
additional units of their trust without a sales fee.                            

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Income Account:

        (2)  the amounts paid for purchases of replacement securities or for

into the Reserve Account;

        expenses of the trustee, the depositor, the evaluator, the

       (5)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for

          other securities acquired during such calendar year, if any;

         (2)  the number of units outstanding on the last business day of such

         both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as 
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has 
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of    
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association  
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not   
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States   
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be      
amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as
(1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the  
acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the       
schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the   
holders of which are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The    
trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the interest in a trust      
represented by units without the consent of all affected unitholders.  Except   
for the amendments, changes or modifications described above, neither the       
sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment, change or           
modification of the trust agreement without the giving of notice and the        
obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66    
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may     
reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are required to   
consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without 
the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the      
affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter  
the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee    
with the power to engage in business or investment activities other than as     
specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax      
status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the units being
deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal     
income tax purposes, result in a variation of the investment of unitholders in  
the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of the substance of any such    
amendment.                                                                      

-11-

P-->48732nd�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held 
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination 
date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the applicable minimum value  
stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total value of securities        
deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), the trustee may, in 
its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.
A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units representing 66   
2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.  In addition, the sponsor may       
terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer 
maintained.  A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a      
sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than
40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.
If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the       
sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee
paid by such purchaser.                                                         

 Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the scheduled
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all 
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection   
with the termination of the trust.  The sponsor may assist the trustee in these 
sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law.  The  
sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales.     

   The sponsor will generally instruct the trustee to sell the securities as
quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its        
judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but 
it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of      
within a reasonable time after a trust's termination.  The sponsor does not     
anticipate that the period will be longer than one month, and it could be as    
short as one day, depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold.  The 
liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security   
and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day.   
Of course, no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities   
will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings.              

     Approximately thirty days prior to termination of a trust, the trustee will
notify unitholders of the termination and provide a form allowing qualifying    
unitholders to elect an in-kind distribution.  A unitholder who owns the minimum
number of units described in the prospectus may request an in-kind distribution 
from the trustee instead of cash.  The trustee will make an in-kind distribution
through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry   
form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository     
Trust Company.  The unitholder will be entitled to receive whole shares of each 
of the securities comprising the portfolio of a trust and cash from the Capital 
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the unitholder is entitled.  The
trustee may adjust the number of shares of any security included in a           
unitholder's in-kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
shares.  The sponsor may terminate the in-kind distribution option at any time  
upon notice to the unitholders.  Special federal income tax consequences will   
result if a unitholder requests an in-kind distribution.                        

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to                                       

-12-

unitholders thereof (upon surrender for cancellation of certificates for units, 
if issued) their pro rata share of the balances remaining in the Income and     
Capital Accounts of the trust.                                                  

The sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a   
subsequent series of a trust at approximately the time of the mandatory         
termination date.  If the sponsor does offer such units for sale, unitholders   
may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price  
that includes a reduced sales fee.  There is, however, no assurance that units  
of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at that time, or if       
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the     
requests of any or all unitholders.                                             

THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company    
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal    
unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, 
New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision  
and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.                              

    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The 
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a     
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after        
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent            
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the       
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or    
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the      
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in  
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any  
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such                            

-13-

P-->48734th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
written standards for the trustee's performance as shall be established from    
time to time by the sponsor, or if the sponsor determines in good faith that    
there has occurred either (1) a material deterioration in the creditworthiness  
of the trustee or (2) one or more grossly negligent acts on the part of the     
trustee with respect to a trust, the sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written    
notice, may remove the trustee and appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter  
provided, by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be       
delivered to the trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee.      
Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each unitholder by the
sponsor.  Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such    
successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the        
original trustee shall vest in the successor.  The trustee must be a corporation
organized under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof, be         
authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers and have at all times an    
aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $5,000,000.   

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Fixed Income Securities, L.P.
acting through its Advisor's Asset Management division.  The sponsor is a       
broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-dealers, registered  
representatives, investment advisers and other financial professionals. The     
sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, Monument, Colorado
80132. You can contact the Advisor's Asset Management division at 8100 East 22nd
Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using the contacts   
listed on the back cover of the prospectus. The sponsor is a registered broker- 
dealer and investment adviser and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation      
(SIPC), and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).   

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of   
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such      
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as        
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the     
trust agreement.                                                                

    THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Fixed Income Securities, L.P., the sponsor,
also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor may      
resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor or   
trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such   
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by 
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has 
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the        
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of 
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be    
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                                       

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties

thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or responsible in any way for      
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale of any securities.          

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided, 
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or       
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross           
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its   
obligations under the trust agreement.                                          

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing   
and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part of the 
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from   
the use of these funds.                                                         

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor   
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate  
cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the 
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any  
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based  
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                              

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such                                            

-15-

compensation, when combined with all compensation from other unit investment    
trusts for which the sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services,  
exceed the aggregate cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based  
on the total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1   
for any annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be
based on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                        

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when 
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the  
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate  
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,   
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units    
outstanding at the end of each month.                                           

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Income Account of the related trust to the extent funds are   
available and then from the Capital Account.  Each such fee (other than any     
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders  
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.                                      

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon         
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable   
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the     
trust.  If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to  
provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell     
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or     
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration  
statement each year.                                                            

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION                                 

When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the   
securities in the trust may be altered.  In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the sponsor to specify minimum amounts in which  
blocks of securities are to be sold.  In effecting purchases and sales of a     
trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct that orders be placed with 
and                                                                             

-16-

P-->48737th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be        
affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or dealers participating in the offering 
of units.                                                                       

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  The public offering price per unit is equal to the net asset    
value per unit plus the applicable sales fee referred to in the prospectus.  The
sales fee as a percentage of the public offering price is set forth in the      
prospectus.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing 
unit purchases.                                                                 

As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the 
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of     
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation 
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of 
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised     
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and  
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such       
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   
each such day.  Orders received by the trustee, sponsor or any dealer for       
purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York  
Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next determination of price.   

  Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering    
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus. 
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or  
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of 
the underlying securities.  Net asset value per unit is determined by dividing  
the value of a trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities, by the total number of units outstanding.  The portfolio securities
are valued by the evaluator as follows: If the security is listed on a national 
securities exchange, the evaluation will generally be based on the last sale    
price on the exchange (unless the evaluator deems the price inappropriate as a  
basis for evaluation).  If the security is not so listed or, if so listed and   
the principal market for the security is other than on the exchange, the        
evaluation will generally be made by the evaluator in good faith based on an    
appraisal of the fair value of the securities using recognized pricing methods. 

     The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing 
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made 
during the preceding 24-hour period.                                            

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may             

-17-

P-->48738th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the     
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  If a unitholder desires to have certificates  
representing units purchased, such certificates will be delivered as soon as    
possible following his written request therefor.                                

     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and through others.     
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial   
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The 
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in        
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional  
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not   
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In 
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the         
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the 
cost of such securities to a trust.  The sponsor may also realize profits or    
losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from 
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or   
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or  
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such          
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of     
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said    
units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator.  While the sponsor may
repurchase units from time to time, it does not currently intend to maintain an 
active secondary market for units.  Unitholders who wish to dispose of their    
units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to    
determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption   
price and, if so, the amount thereof.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units     
prior to such time as the entire creation and development fee on such units has 
been collected will not be assessed the amount of the remaining creation and    
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  The offering price of  
any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the    
currently effective prospectus describing                                       

-18-

P-->48739th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
such units.  Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will    
belong to the sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market,  
it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of  
units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.                            

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by tendering such certificate  
to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or      
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee.  Unitholders must  
sign the request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their 
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be redeemed.  Additional documentation may be requested, and a     
signature guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors,           
administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in        
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.  A certificate      
should only be sent by registered or certified mail for the protection of the   
unitholder.  Since tender of the certificate is required for redemption when one
has been issued, units represented by a certificate cannot be redeemed until the
certificate representing such units has been received by the purchasers.        

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing 
redemption requests.                                                            

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances, the  
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Income Account of a trust to  
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Capital Account for a trust.             

  Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request a distribution in
kind (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash redemption of  
an amount and value of                                                          

-19-

P-->48740th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
securities per unit equal to the redemption price per unit as determined as of  
the evaluation time next following the tender, provided that the tendering      
unitholder meets the requirements stated in the prospectus and the unitholder   
has elected to redeem at least thirty days prior to the termination of the      
trust. If the unitholder meets these requirements, a Distribution In Kind will  
be made by the trustee through the distribution of each of the securities of the
trust in book entry form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-     
dealer at Depository Trust Company.  The tendering unitholder shall be entitled 
to receive whole shares of each of the securities comprising the portfolio of   
the trust and cash from the Capital Account equal to the fractional shares to   
which the tendering unitholder is entitled.  The trustee shall make any         
adjustments necessary to reflect differences between the redemption price of the
units and the value of the securities distributed in kind as of the date of     
tender.  If funds in the Capital Account are insufficient to cover the required 
cash distribution to the tendering unitholder, the trustee may sell securities. 
The in kind redemption option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time.     

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold  
or redeemed in-kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust  
may be, reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately
the same proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a    
time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices 
than might otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be    
more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of   
the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                      

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.                                            

COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units of each
trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation time stated in the      
prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for redemption and on   
any other business day desired by it, by:                                       

-20-

P-->48741st�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
A.   Adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the
     trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such securities
 and (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities held in the
trust as determined by the evaluator as described above;              

B.   Deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
   Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses, including
  but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee (including legal and
  auditing fees), the evaluator, the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash
     held for distribution to unitholders of record as of the business day prior
 to the evaluation being made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the
trust; and                                                            

C.   Finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust will lower the  
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts.  Fees and charges with respect 
to such plans may vary.                                                         

OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates unless a unitholder, the unitholder's registered broker/dealer or  
the clearing agent for such broker/dealer makes a written request to the        
trustee.  Units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by presenting and surrendering 
such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written   
instrument or instruments of transfer which should be sent by registered or     
certified mail for the protection of the unitholder.  Unitholders must sign such
written request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their  
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be transferred.  Such signatures must be guaranteed as described   
above.                                                                          

  Units may be purchased and certificates, if requested, will be issued in
denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof, subject to the minimum       
investment requirement.  Fractions of units, if any, will be computed to three  
decimal places.  Any certificate issued will be numbered serially for           
identification, issued in fully registered form and will be transferable only on
the books of the trustee.  The trustee may require a unitholder to pay a        
reasonable fee, to be determined in the sole discretion of the trustee, for each
certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with each such transfer or interchange.  The trustee at
the present time does not intend to charge for the normal transfer or           
interchange of certificates.  Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost certificates 
will be replaced upon

delivery to the trustee of satisfactory indemnity (generally amounting to 3% of 
the market value of the units), affidavit of loss, evidence of ownership and    
payment of expenses incurred.                                                   

TAXATION                                                                        

 The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning your trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
trust units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is  
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors   
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of trust units, as well 
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. 
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                          

     The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of       
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

     If so indicated in the prospectus, your trust intends (i) to elect and (ii)
to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the Code and to     
comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal
income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders.          

  To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or  
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income    
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)       
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year, 
(i) at least 50% of the market value of the trust's assets is represented by    
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the    
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with   
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of   
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the trust's   
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of   
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is     
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the        
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or   
related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded      
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable 
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net short-   
term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes net   
capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income    
each taxable year.

P-->48743rd�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
     As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust       
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to    
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share  
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their         
proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income   
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds   
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the  
current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in October, November or   
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during       
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to  
unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.                 

     If your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income  
were distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and  
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income.              

 If the trust is treated as holding directly or indirectly 10 percent or
more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and all
U.S. shareholders collectively own more than 50 percent of the vote or value of 
the stock of such corporation, the foreign corporation may be treated as a      
"controlled foreign corporation" (a "CFC") from a U.S. tax perspective.  In such
circumstances, the trust will be required to include certain types of passive   
income and certain other types of income relating to insurance, sales and       
services with related parties and oil related income in the trust's taxable     
income whether or not such income is distributed.                               

  If the trust holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that     
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as 
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties                                

-23-

or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in investments      
producing such passive income, the trust could be subject to U.S. federal income
tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with     
respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or gain is timely     
distributed to its unitholders.  The trust will not be able to pass through to  
its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes.  The trust may be able  
to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences.  In   
this case, the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the     
value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to   
the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income. Under this     
election, the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of
its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock   
during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to the          
distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% 
excise tax (described above). Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as    
qualified dividend income.                                                      

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

    Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the prospectus,
as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included from time to 
time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information on the      
performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may be     
included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and may
reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may also
be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund        
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services  
Inc. (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates          
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund 
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies     
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of  
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index  
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock          
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of 30      
widely traded industrial common stocks) or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (an  
unmanaged diversified index of 500 stocks) or similar measurement standards     
during the same period of time.
