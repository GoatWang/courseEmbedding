This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund  
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you  
invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem
or do not redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The example    
also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund's 
operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or 
lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells    
securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund      
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in   
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES                                                 
Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the fund's net assets (plus the 
amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) are invested in equity        
securities of companies with market capitalizations at the time of investment   
comparable to companies in the MSCI World Index. The MSCI World Index is a free 
float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure 
the equity market performance of developed markets and consist of twenty-three  
developed market country indices. The fund's investments generally will include 
common stocks, preferred stocks, securities convertible into U.S. common stocks,

The fund's sub-adviser, Zebra Capital Management, LLC ("Zebra") seeks to capture
a liquidity premium among fundamentally strong, publicly-traded equities. A     
liquidity premium exists in public equity markets, as more liquid stocks tend to
be priced at a premium, while less liquid stocks are priced at a discount, thus 
having higher expected returns. Zebra targets stocks with strong fundamentals   
(i.e. earnings, book value, cash flows) that trade less than stocks with        
comparable fundamentals. Despite producing similar levels of earnings and cash  
flows, these less liquid stocks can often be purchased at lower prices, offering
higher expected returns. Frequently, a fundamentally-sound stock is less traded 
because it has temporarily fallen out of favor. Over time, the market will      
recognize this stock again, and its price will increase as its trading activity 
rises, allowing Zebra to capture its liquidity premium and produce higher       
returns. Stocks are typically sold when fundamentals deteriorate, trading       
activity increases relative to changes in a stock's fundamentals, or Zebra      
believes there are greater opportunities to capture liquidity premium in other  
stocks.

Zebra's strategy of purchasing strong fundamental stocks with lower trading     
volumes results in a portfolio that is pro-fundamental, anti-glamour and        
contrarian in terms of the stocks it favors. Similar to value investing         
strategies, the fund does seek to purchase stocks with strong earnings and cash 
flows offered by the market at a discount. However, Zebra's liquidity-based     
approach has demonstrated the ability to produce returns distinct from, and in  
addition to, traditional investment styles, such as value or size investing.    

PRINCIPAL RISKS                                                                 

MARKET RISK/SMALLER COMPANY RISK--The market values of securities owned by the  
fund may decline, at times sharply and unpredictably, due to declines in the    
overall stock market. In general, the value of the fund will move in the same   
direction as the overall stock market, which will vary from day to day in       
response to the activities of individual companies, as well as general market,  
regulatory, political and economic conditions. This risk is generally greater   
for lower market capitalization companies because they tend to have more limited
product lines, shorter operating histories, less experienced management and more
limited financial resources than larger companies. Stocks of smaller companies  
may be less liquid than those of larger companies and may experience greater    
price fluctuations. In addition, stocks of smaller companies may not be widely  
followed by the investment community, resulting in less demand.                 

NON-U.S. INVESTMENT RISK--Non-U.S. companies or U.S. companies with significant 
non-U.S. operations may be subject to risks in addition to those of companies   
that principally operate in the United States. This increased risk is a result  
of, among other things, regulatory, political, social and economic developments 
abroad; different legal, regulatory and tax environments; less liquidity and    
greater volatility; a lack of uniform accounting, auditing and financial        
reporting standards; and increased price volatility.                            

VALUE STOCKS RISK--Value stocks are subject to the risk that their intrinsic    
value may never be realized by the market or that their prices may go down.     
While the fund's investments in value stocks may limit its downside risk over   
time, the fund may produce more modest gains than riskier stock funds as a      
trade-off for this potentially lower risk.                                      

LIQUIDITY RISK--From time to time, certain securities held by the fund may have 
limited marketability and may be difficult to sell at favorable times or prices.
It is possible that certain securities held by the fund will not be able to be  
sold in sufficient amounts or in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash 
necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund             
shareholders. In such event, there would be a greater chance that a fund may be 
forced to curtail or suspend redemptions, in which case you might experience a  
delay or inability to liquidate your investment at the desired time or in the   
desired amount.                                                                 

SECURITIES SELECTION RISK--Securities selected by the subadviser for the fund   
may not perform to expectations. This could result in the fund's                
underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives.

MARKET EVENTS--Global turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in  
credit and fixed-income markets may negatively affect a broad range of issuers  
which could have an adverse effect on the fund.                                 

SECURITIES LENDING RISK--To the extent the fund lends its securities, it may be 
subject to the following risk. Borrowers of the fund's securities typically     
provide collateral in the form of cash that the fund reinvests in additional    
securities. It is possible that the securities in which the collateral is       
invested may not perform sufficiently to cover the return collateral payments   
owed to borrowers. In addition, delays may occur in the recovery of securities  
from borrowers, which could interfere with the fund's ability to vote proxies or
to settle transactions.                                                         

INFLATION RISK--It is possible that the value of assets or income from          
investments in the fund will be less in the future as inflation decreases the   
value of money.                                                                 

INVESTMENT RISK--An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other 
government agency. When you sell your shares of the fund, they could be worth   
less than what you paid for them. Therefore, as with any mutual fund investment,
you may lose money by investing in the fund.                                    

FUND PERFORMANCE                                                                
Fund performance is not included in this Prospectus because the fund has not    
been in existence for a full calendar year.

PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES                                                
You may purchase, redeem or exchange shares of the fund on any business day,    
which is any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Generally,   
you may purchase, redeem or exchange shares only through institutional channels,
such as financial intermediaries and retirement platforms. You should contact   
your financial intermediary or refer to your plan

documents for information on how to invest in the fund. Requests must be        
received in good order by the fund or its agent (financial intermediary or plan 
sponsor, if applicable) prior to the close of the regular trading session of the
New York Stock Exchange in order to receive that day's net asset value. The     
minimum investment for Class A shares, Class C shares and Class P shares is     
$[2,500] per fund account for non-retirement accounts and $[500] per fund       
account for certain tax-deferred accounts or UGMA/UTMA accounts. The maximum    
purchase in Class C shares is $[500,000] for any single purchase. The sales     
charge and expense structure of Class A shares may be more advantageous for     
investors purchasing more than $[500,000] of fund shares. The minimum investment
for Class I shares is $[1 million] for institutional investors. Institutional   
investors generally may meet the minimum investment amount by aggregating       
multiple accounts within the fund. Accounts offered through an intermediary     
institution must meet the minimum investment requirements of $[500] for         
tax-deferred accounts and $[2,500] for other account types.                     

TAX INFORMATION                                                                 
The fund's distributions are taxable and will generally be taxed as ordinary    
income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred        
arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account.         

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES                   
If you purchase shares of the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial   
intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies may pay the   
intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments   
may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other     
intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment 
or to recommend one share class over another. Ask your salesperson or visit your
financial intermediary's website for more information.

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells    
securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund      
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in   
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES                                                 
Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the fund's net assets (plus the 
amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) are invested in equity        
securities of companies with market capitalizations at the time of investment   
comparable to companies in the MSCI World ex USA Index. The MSCI World ex USA   
Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is     
designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets and      
consist of twenty-two developed market country indices. The fund's investments  
generally will include common stocks, preferred stocks, securities convertible  
into U.S. common stocks, U.S. dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts   
and U.S. dollar-denominated foreign stocks traded on U.S. exchanges.            

The fund's sub-adviser, Zebra Capital Management, LLC ("Zebra") seeks to capture
a liquidity premium among fundamentally strong, publicly-traded equities. A     
liquidity premium exists in public equity markets, as more liquid stocks tend to
be priced at a premium, while less liquid stocks are priced at a discount, thus 
having higher expected returns. Zebra targets stocks with strong fundamentals   
(i.e. earnings, book value, cash flows) that trade less than stocks with        
comparable fundamentals. Despite producing similar levels of earnings and cash  
flows, these less liquid stocks can often be purchased at lower prices, offering
higher expected returns. Frequently, a fundamentally-sound stock is less traded 
because it has temporarily fallen out of favor. Over time, the market will      
recognize this stock again, and its price will increase as its trading activity 
rises, allowing Zebra to capture its liquidity premium and produce higher       
returns. Stocks are typically sold when fundamentals deteriorate, trading       
activity increases relative to changes in a stock's fundamentals, or Zebra      
believes there are greater opportunities to capture liquidity premium in other  
stocks.                                                                         

Zebra's strategy of purchasing strong fundamental stocks with lower trading     
volumes results in a portfolio that is pro-fundamental, anti-glamour and        
contrarian in terms of the stocks it favors.

Similar to value investing strategies, the fund does seek to purchase stocks    
with strong earnings and cash flows offered by the market at a discount.        
However, Zebra's liquidity-based approach has demonstrated the ability to       
produce returns distinct from, and in addition to, traditional investment       
styles, such as value or size investing.                                        

PRINCIPAL RISKS                                                                 

MARKET RISK/SMALLER COMPANY RISK--The market values of securities owned by the  
fund may decline, at times sharply and unpredictably, due to declines in the    
overall stock market. In general, the value of the fund will move in the same   
direction as the overall stock market, which will vary from day to day in       
response to the activities of individual companies, as well as general market,  
regulatory, political and economic conditions. This risk is generally greater   
for lower market capitalization companies because they tend to have more limited
product lines, shorter operating histories, less experienced management and more
limited financial resources than larger companies. Stocks of smaller companies  
may be less liquid than those of larger companies and may experience greater    
price fluctuations. In addition, stocks of smaller companies may not be widely  
followed by the investment community, resulting in less demand.                 

NON-U.S. INVESTMENT RISK--Non-U.S. companies or U.S. companies with significant 
non-U.S. operations may be subject to risks in addition to those of companies   
that principally operate in the United States. This increased risk is a result  
of, among other things, regulatory, political, social and economic developments 
abroad; different legal, regulatory and tax environments; less liquidity and    
greater volatility; a lack of uniform accounting, auditing and financial        
reporting standards; and increased price volatility.                            

VALUE STOCKS RISK--Value stocks are subject to the risk that their intrinsic    
value may never be realized by the market or that their prices may go down.     
While the fund's investments in value stocks may limit its downside risk over   
time, the fund may produce more modest gains than riskier stock funds as a      
trade-off for this potentially lower risk.                                      

LIQUIDITY RISK--From time to time, certain securities held by the fund may have 
limited marketability and may be difficult to sell at favorable times or prices.
It is possible that certain securities held by the fund will not be able to be  
sold in sufficient amounts or in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash 
necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund             
shareholders. In such event, there would be a greater chance that a fund may be 
forced to curtail or suspend redemptions, in which case you might experience a  
delay or inability to liquidate your investment at the desired time or in the   
desired amount.                                                                 

SECURITIES SELECTION RISK--Securities selected by the subadviser for the fund   
may not perform to expectations. This could result in the fund's                
underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives.    

MARKET EVENTS--Global turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in  
credit and fixed-income markets may negatively affect a broad range of issuers  
which could have an adverse effect on the fund.

SECURITIES LENDING RISK--To the extent the fund lends its securities, it may be 
subject to the following risk. Borrowers of the fund's securities typically     
provide collateral in the form of cash that the fund reinvests in additional    
securities. It is possible that the securities in which the collateral is       
invested may not perform sufficiently to cover the return collateral payments   
owed to borrowers. In addition, delays may occur in the recovery of securities  
from borrowers, which could interfere with the fund's ability to vote proxies or
to settle transactions.                                                         

INFLATION RISK--It is possible that the value of assets or income from          
investments in the fund will be less in the future as inflation decreases the   
value of money.                                                                 

INVESTMENT RISK--An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other 
government agency. When you sell your shares of the fund, they could be worth   
less than what you paid for them. Therefore, as with any mutual fund investment,
you may lose money by investing in the fund.                                    

FUND PERFORMANCE                                                                
Fund performance is not included in this Prospectus because the fund has not    
been in existence for a full calendar year.

PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES                                                
You may purchase, redeem or exchange shares of the fund on any business day,    
which is any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Generally,   
you may purchase, redeem or exchange shares only through institutional channels,
such as financial intermediaries and retirement platforms. You should contact   
your financial intermediary or refer to your plan documents for information on  
how to invest in the fund. Requests must be received in good order by the fund  
or its agent (financial intermediary or plan sponsor, if applicable) prior to   
the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange in order
to receive that day's net asset value. The minimum investment for Class A       
shares, Class C shares and Class P

shares is $[2,500] per fund account for non-retirement accounts and $[500] per  
fund account for certain tax-deferred accounts or UGMA/UTMA accounts. The       
maximum purchase in Class C shares is $[500,000] for any single purchase. The   
sales charge and expense structure of Class A shares may be more advantageous   
for investors purchasing more than $[500,000] of fund shares. The minimum       
investment for Class I shares is $[1 million] for institutional investors.      
Institutional investors generally may meet the minimum investment amount by     
aggregating multiple accounts within the fund. Accounts offered through an      
intermediary institution must meet the minimum investment requirements of $[500]
for tax-deferred accounts and $[2,500] for other account types.                 

TAX INFORMATION                                                                 
The fund's distributions are taxable and will generally be taxed as ordinary    
income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred        
arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account.         

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES                   
If you purchase shares of the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial   
intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies may pay the   
intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments   
may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other     
intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment 
or to recommend one share class over another. Ask your salesperson or visit your
financial intermediary's website for more information.

the time periods indicated and then either redeem or do not redeem all of your  
shares at the end of those periods. The example also assumes that your          
investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund's operating expenses     
remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on    
these assumptions your costs would be:

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells    
securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund      
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in   
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES                                                 
Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the fund's net assets (plus the 
amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) are invested in equity        
securities of companies with market capitalizations at the time of investment   
comparable to companies in the Russell 3000(R) Index. The Russell 3000(R) Index 
measures the performance of the largest 3000 U.S. companies representing        
approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market and is reconstituted     
annually to ensure new and growing equities are reflected. The fund's           
investments generally will include common stocks, preferred stocks, securities  
convertible into U.S. common stocks, U.S. dollar-denominated American Depositary
Receipts and U.S. dollar-denominated foreign stocks traded on U.S. exchanges.   

The fund's sub-adviser, Zebra Capital Management, LLC ("Zebra") seeks to capture
a liquidity premium among fundamentally strong, publicly-traded equities. A     
liquidity premium exists in public equity markets, as more liquid stocks tend to
be priced at a premium, while less liquid stocks are priced at a discount, thus 
having higher expected returns. Zebra targets stocks with strong fundamentals   
(i.e. earnings, book value, cash flows) that trade less than stocks with        
comparable fundamentals. Despite producing similar levels of earnings and cash  
flows, these less liquid stocks can often be purchased at lower prices, offering
higher expected returns. Frequently, a fundamentally-sound stock is less traded 
because it has temporarily fallen out of favor. Over time, the market will      
recognize this stock again, and its price will increase as its trading activity 
rises, allowing Zebra to capture its liquidity premium and produce higher       
returns. Stocks are typically sold when fundamentals deteriorate, trading       
activity increases relative to changes in a stock's fundamentals, or Zebra      
believes there are greater opportunities to capture liquidity premium in other  
stocks.                                                                         

Zebra's strategy of purchasing strong fundamental stocks with lower trading     
volumes results in a portfolio that is pro-fundamental, anti-glamour and        
contrarian in terms of the stocks it favors.

Similar to value investing strategies, the fund does seek to purchase stocks    
with strong earnings and cash flows offered by the market at a discount.        
However, Zebra's liquidity-based approach has demonstrated the ability to       
produce returns distinct from, and in addition to, traditional investment       
styles, such as value or size investing.                                        

PRINCIPAL RISKS                                                                 

MARKET RISK/SMALLER COMPANY RISK--The market values of securities owned by the  
fund may decline, at times sharply and unpredictably, due to declines in the    
overall stock market. In general, the value of the fund will move in the same   
direction as the overall stock market, which will vary from day to day in       
response to the activities of individual companies, as well as general market,  
regulatory, political and economic conditions. This risk is generally greater   
for lower market capitalization companies because they tend to have more limited
product lines, shorter operating histories, less experienced management and more
limited financial resources than larger companies. Stocks of smaller companies  
may be less liquid than those of larger companies and may experience greater    
price fluctuations. In addition, stocks of smaller companies may not be widely  
followed by the investment community, resulting in less demand.                 

NON-U.S. INVESTMENT RISK--Non-U.S. companies or U.S. companies with significant 
non-U.S. operations may be subject to risks in addition to those of companies   
that principally operate in the United States. This increased risk is a result  
of, among other things, regulatory, political, social and economic developments 
abroad; different legal, regulatory and tax environments; less liquidity and    
greater volatility; a lack of uniform accounting, auditing and financial        
reporting standards; and increased price volatility.                            

VALUE STOCKS RISK--Value stocks are subject to the risk that their intrinsic    
value may never be realized by the market or that their prices may go down.     
While the fund's investments in value stocks may limit its downside risk over   
time, the fund may produce more modest gains than riskier stock funds as a      
trade-off for this potentially lower risk.                                      

LIQUIDITY RISK--From time to time, certain securities held by the fund may have 
limited marketability and may be difficult to sell at favorable times or prices.
It is possible that certain securities held by the fund will not be able to be  
sold in sufficient amounts or in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash 
necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund             
shareholders. In such event, there would be a greater chance that a fund may be 
forced to curtail or suspend redemptions, in which case you might experience a  
delay or inability to liquidate your investment at the desired time or in the   
desired amount.                                                                 

SECURITIES SELECTION RISK--Securities selected by the subadviser for the fund   
may not perform to expectations. This could result in the fund's                
underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives.    

MARKET EVENTS--Global turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in  
credit and fixed-income markets may negatively affect a broad range of issuers  
which could have an adverse effect on the fund.                                 

13

P-->N-1A19th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 19th
SECURITIES LENDING RISK--To the extent the fund lends its securities, it may be 
subject to the following risk. Borrowers of the fund's securities typically     
provide collateral in the form of cash that the fund reinvests in additional    
securities. It is possible that the securities in which the collateral is       
invested may not perform sufficiently to cover the return collateral payments   
owed to borrowers. In addition, delays may occur in the recovery of securities  
from borrowers, which could interfere with the fund's ability to vote proxies or
to settle transactions.                                                         

INFLATION RISK--It is possible that the value of assets or income from          
investments in the fund will be less in the future as inflation decreases the   
value of money.                                                                 

INVESTMENT RISK--An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other 
government agency. When you sell your shares of the fund, they could be worth   
less than what you paid for them. Therefore, as with any mutual fund investment,
you may lose money by investing in the fund.                                    

FUND PERFORMANCE                                                                
Fund performance is not included in this Prospectus because the fund has not    
been in existence for a full calendar year.

PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES                                                
You may purchase, redeem or exchange shares of the fund on any business day,    
which is any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Generally,   
you may purchase, redeem or exchange shares only through institutional channels,
such as financial intermediaries and retirement platforms. You should contact   
your financial intermediary or refer to your plan documents for information on  
how to invest in the fund. Requests must be received in good order by the fund  
or its agent (financial intermediary or plan sponsor, if applicable) prior to   
the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange in order
to receive that day's net asset value. The minimum investment for Class A       
shares, Class C shares and Class P

shares is $[2,500] per fund account for non-retirement accounts and $[500] per  
fund account for certain tax-deferred accounts or UGMA/UTMA accounts. The       
maximum purchase in Class C shares is $[500,000] for any single purchase. The   
sales charge and expense structure of Class A shares may be more advantageous   
for investors purchasing more than $[500,000] of fund shares. The minimum       
investment for Class I shares is $[1 million] for institutional investors.      
Institutional investors generally may meet the minimum investment amount by     
aggregating multiple accounts within the fund. Accounts offered through an      
intermediary institution must meet the minimum investment requirements of $[500]
for tax-deferred accounts and $[2,500] for other account types.                 

TAX INFORMATION                                                                 
The fund's distributions are taxable and will generally be taxed as ordinary    
income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred        
arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account.         

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES                   
If you purchase shares of the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial   
intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies may pay the   
intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments   
may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other     
intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment 
or to recommend one share class over another. Ask your salesperson or visit your
financial intermediary's website for more information.

Section 2   Additional Information About the Funds                              

   To help you better understand the funds, this section provides a detailed
discussion of the funds' investment and risk management strategies.   
However, this Prospectus does not describe all of a fund's investment 
practices. For additional information these matters, please see the   
   Statement of Additional Information, which is available by calling Destra
Advisor LLC at [____________], writing to Destra Advisor LLC at       
[_______________], emailing Destra Advisor LLC at [__________________]
or visiting destracapital.com.                                        

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INVESTMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES 

The investment objective of each fund is to seek long-term capital    
appreciation. A fund's investment objective may not be changed without
  shareholder approval. A fund's investment policies may be changed by the
     Board of Trustees of the fund without shareholder approval unless otherwise
noted in this Prospectus or the Statement of Additional Information.  

80% POLICY                                                            

   Each fund has a policy that will require it to invest at least 80% of its
  total assets in securities and financial instruments that are consistent
    with the fund's name. Shareholders will be notified of any changes to this
   policy at least 60 days in advance of the change and this Prospectus will
be supplemented.                                                      

EQUITY SECURITIES                                                     

Under normal market conditions, each fund invests primarily in equity 
securities, including common stocks and other securities with equity  
characteristics.                                                      

NON-U.S. INVESTMENTS                                                  

Each fund may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated American Depositary   
   Receipts (ADRs) and U.S. dollar-denominated foreign stocks traded on U.S.
exchanges issued by companies organized or headquartered in foreign   
countries and/or doing significant business outside the U.S. ADRs are 
 receipts issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of the
underlying securities issued by non-U.S. companies.                   

 TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE POLICY, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

    Under normal conditions, each fund invests substantially all of its assets
 with the goal of attaining its investment objective. The remainder of a
   fund's assets may be held as cash or invested in short-term securities or
     cash equivalents. The percentage of a fund invested in such holdings varies
    and depends heavily on current market conditions, among other factors. For
 temporary defensive purposes and during periods of high cash inflows or
  outflows, a fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and
   invest part or all of its assets in these securities or it may hold cash.
During such periods, a fund                                           

16

 may not be able to achieve its investment objective. A fund may adopt a
     defensive strategy when the portfolio managers believes securities in which
  a fund normally invests have elevated risks due to political or economic
   factors and in other extraordinary circumstances. For more information on
eligible short-term investments, see the Statement of Additional      
Information.                                                          

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RISKS 

  Risk is inherent in any investment. Investing in a mutual fund--even the
    most conservative--involves a number of risks, including the risk that you
 may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may
     lose part or all of your investment. Global turbulence in financial markets
 and reduced liquidity in credit and fixed-income markets may negatively
   affect a broad range of issuers which could have an adverse effect on the
funds. Therefore, before investing you should consider carefully the  
     following risks that you assume when you invest in a fund. Because of these
and other risks, you should consider an investment in a fund to be a  
long-term investment.                                                 

   Market risk: The market values of securities owned by a fund may decline,
  at times sharply and unpredictably, due to drops in the stock market. In
   general, the value of a fund that invests principally in stocks will move
     in the same direction as the overall stock market, which will vary from day
to day in response to the historical and prospective earnings of the  
     issuer, the value of its assets, management decisions, decreased demand for
  an issuer's products or services, increased production costs, as well as
general market, regulatory, political and economic conditions, such as
  interest rates, currency exchange rates, investor perceptions and market
 liquidity. Under normal conditions, the stock markets generally move in
cycles over time, with periods of rising prices followed by periods of
declining prices. These fluctuations could be a sustained trend or a  
drastic movement and the value of your investment may reflect these   
fluctuations.                                                         

Smaller company risk: Companies with lower market capitalizations may 
     involve greater risk than larger capitalization companies because they tend
to have more limited product lines, shorter operating histories, less 
 experienced management and more limited financial resources than larger
 companies. Stocks of smaller companies may be less liquid than those of
larger companies and may experience greater price fluctuations. In    
 addition, stocks of smaller companies may not be widely followed by the
investment community, resulting in less demand. As a result, certain  
     securities may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time and the price
that a fund would like and, consequently, a fund may have to lower the
   price, sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity.
  Any of these potential circumstances, if realized, could have a negative
effect on fund management or performance.                             

  Style-specific risk: The funds emphasize a value style of investing and,
 therefore, seek undervalued companies with characteristics for improved
  valuations. The types of companies sought by the fund are subject to the
     risk that their intrinsic value may never be realized by the market or that
 their prices may go down. It is possible that such companies may remain
undervalued for extended periods of time. While a fund's              

17

P-->N-1A23rd Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 23rd
     investments in value stocks may limit its downside risk over time, the fund
     may produce more modest gains than riskier other stock funds as a trade-off
 for this potentially lower risk. In addition, different types of stocks
tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic    
conditions and a fund's performance may be affected adversely if value
stocks become unpopular with or lose favor among investors.           

   Non-U.S. investment risk: Companies organized or headquartered in foreign
 countries or U.S. companies with significant non-U.S. operations may be
     subject to risks in addition to those of companies that principally operate
  in the United States. This increased risk is due to potential political,
    social and economic developments abroad, different regulatory environments
 and laws, potential seizure by the government of company assets, higher
   taxation, withholding taxes on dividends and interest, limitations on the
    use or transfer of portfolio assets, increased price volatility and delays
    in transaction settlement in some foreign markets. Other risks include the
following:                                                            

o    Non-U.S. companies may not be subject to accounting standards or 
        governmental supervision comparable to U.S. companies, and there may
be less public information about their operations.          

   o    Enforcing legal rights may be difficult, costly and slow in non-U.S.
   countries and there may be particular problems enforcing claims
against non-U.S. governments.                               

     o    Changes in currency exchange rates, which have increased potential for
      volatility, may affect the value of dividends and interest paid by
          non-U.S. companies, and an increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar
       relative to these other currencies may cause the value of a fund to
decline.                                                    

o    Non-U.S. markets may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S.  
markets.                                                    

  Liquidity risk: The funds invest in certain securities that have limited
     marketability. If the economy experiences a sudden downturn, it is possible
 that certain securities held by the fund will not be able to be sold in
 sufficient amounts or in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash
necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund   
  shareholders. In such event, there would be a greater chance that a fund
  may be forced to curtail or suspend redemptions, in which case you might
     experience a delay or inability to liquidate your investment at the desired
time or in the desired amount. In addition, the valuation of a fund's 
investments may become more difficult if objective market prices are  
unavailable.                                                          

 Derivatives risk: A derivative refers to any financial investment whose
    value is derived, at least, in part, from the price of another security or
  a specified index, asset or rate. There is different, and often greater,
   risk involved when investing in derivatives than the risk associated with
investing directly in the underlying securities or index. These risks 
   include, but are not limited to, market risk, credit risk, leverage risk,
     management risk and liquidity risk. Adverse movements in the price or value
of the underlying asset, index or rate can lead to significant losses,
which may be magnified by certain features of                         

18

P-->N-1A24th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 24th
   the derivatives. These risks are heightened when the management team uses
     derivatives to enhance a fund's return or as a substitute for a position or
     security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or
security held by the fund. In addition, when a fund invests in certain
derivative securities, including, but not limited to, when-issued     
     securities, forward commitments, futures contracts and interest rate swaps,
it is effectively leveraging its investments, which could result in   
 exaggerated changes in the net asset value of the fund's shares and can
  result in losses that exceed the amount originally invested. Derivatives
can be highly complex and their use within a management strategy can  
     require specialized skills. Especially when investing in derivatives, there
   can be no assurance that a given strategy will work as planned or provide
 the return expected. The success of the portfolio managers' derivatives
   strategies will depend on its ability to assess and predict the impact of
    market or economic developments on the underlying asset, index or rate and
    the derivative itself, without the benefit of observing the performance of
the derivative under all possible market conditions. Because of their 
complex nature, derivatives may lose liquidity in a volatile market,  
  raising the possibility that the fund will not be able to sell them at a
     sufficient price or in a timely manner. Gains or losses from positions in a
  derivative instrument may be much greater than the derivative's original
cost.                                                                 

  Small fund risk: The funds currently have less assets than larger funds,
and like other relatively small funds, large inflows and outflows may 
  impact a fund's market exposure for limited periods of time, causing the
  fund's performance to vary from that of the fund's model portfolio. This
  impact may be positive or negative, depending on the direction of market
     movement during the period affected. The funds do not generally limit large
     inflows and outflows, but it has policies in place which seek to reduce the
     impact of these flows where the investment adviser or sub-adviser has prior
knowledge of them.                                                    

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FEES AND EXPENSES                        

Please refer to the following important information when reviewing the
  "Fees and Expenses of the Fund" table in each fund's Summary Prospectus.

         o    "Shareholder Fees" are fees paid directly from your investment and
may include sales loads.                            

       o    "Annual Fund Operating Expenses" are paid out of a fund's assets
        and include fees for portfolio management and administrative
      services, including recordkeeping, subaccounting and other
            shareholder services. You do not pay these fees directly but, as
            the example in each fund's Summary Prospectus shows, these costs
are borne indirectly by all shareholders.           

         o    The "Management Fees" are the investment advisory fee rate paid by
              each fund to Destra. Refer to "Fund Management" in this Prospectus
      for additional information with further description in the
Statement of Additional Information.

    o    "Distribution and Service (12b-1) Fees" include a shareholder
          servicing fee of up to 0.25% for Class C shares. Because 12b-1
      fees are charged as an ongoing fee, over time the fee will
           increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than
paying other types of sales charges.                

       o    A contingent deferred sales charge of up to 1.00% may be imposed
              on certain redemptions of Class A shares bought without an initial
            sales charge and then redeemed within 12 months of purchase. The
            contingent deferred sales charge is not reflected in the example
in each fund's Summary Prospectus.                  

     o    A contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% applies on Class C
        shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. The contingent
         deferred sales charge may be waived for certain investors, as
described in "Redemptions."                         

  o    "Other Expenses" may include administrative fees charged by
        intermediaries for the provision of administrative services,
        including recordkeeping, subaccounting, order processing for
        omnibus or networked accounts, or other shareholder services
             provided on behalf of shareholders of the funds. "Other Expenses"
              may include "Short Sale Dividend Expenses." These expenses include
              dividends or interest on short sales, which are paid to the lender
              of borrowed securities, and stock loan fees, which are paid to the
             prime broker. Such expenses will vary depending on the short sale
      arrangement, whether the securities a fund sells short pay
      dividends or interest, and the amount of such dividends or
           interest. While "Short Sale Dividend Expenses" include interest
           and dividends paid out on short positions and may include stock
          loan fees, they do not take into account the interest credit a
     fund earns on cash proceeds of short sales which serve as
collateral for short positions.                     

o    As described in the "Management Expenses" section of this
        Prospectus, Destra has contractually agreed to waive certain
           funds' "Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses" to certain limits
      until at least [_______]. Because a fee waiver will have a
         positive effect upon a fund's performance, a fund that pays a
      performance-based investment advisory fee may experience a
              performance adjustment that is considered favorable to Destra as a
              result of a fee waiver that is in place during the period when the
performance adjustment applies.                     

     o    All expenses in a fund's "Fees and Expenses of the Fund" table
        are shown without the effect of expense offset arrangements.
          Pursuant to such arrangements, credits realized as a result of
              uninvested cash balances are used to reduce custodian and transfer
agent expenses.

Section 3   Shareholder Information

VALUATION OF SHARES 

     The price of each fund's shares is based on its net asset value ("NAV") per
    share. NAV is calculated for each class of the fund by taking the value of
  the class' total assets, including interest or dividends accrued but not
  yet collected, less all liabilities, and dividing by the total number of
     shares outstanding. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the NAV per
 share. NAV is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00 p.m.
    Eastern Time) on each day the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open for
     business. However, the NAV may be calculated earlier if trading on the NYSE
   is restricted, or as permitted by the SEC. The value of a fund's holdings
   may change on days that are not business days in the United States and on
which you will not be able to purchase or redeem a fund's shares. All 
 valuations are subject to review by the fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate.                                                             

All purchases and redemptions will be duly processed at the NAV next  
  calculated after your request is received in good order by a fund or its
agents. For Class A shares, the public offering price includes any    
     applicable initial sales charge. For Class A shares and Class C shares, the
price you pay to sell shares is also the NAV, however, a contingent   
     deferred sales charge may be taken out of the proceeds. In order to receive
   a day's price, your order must be received in good order by a fund or its
agents by the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE. Your  
financial intermediary may charge you a separate or additional fee for
processing purchases and redemptions of shares.                       

    Securities held by the funds are generally valued at market value. Certain
short-term instruments maturing within 60 days or less are valued at  
    amortized cost, which approximates market value. If a market quotation for
     a security is not readily available or is deemed unreliable, or if an event
     that is expected to affect the value of the security occurs after the close
  of the principal exchange or market on which the security is traded, and
before the close of the NYSE, a fair value of the security (except for
    short-term instruments maturing within 60 days or less) will be determined
  in good faith under policies and procedures established by and under the
supervision of the funds' Trustees. Such events include, but are not  
 limited to: (i) a significant event that may affect the securities of a
     single issuer, such as a merger, bankruptcy, or significant issuer-specific
development; (ii) an event that may affect an entire market, such as a
natural disaster or significant governmental action; (iii) a          
   non-significant event such as a market closing early or not opening, or a
security trading halt; and (iv) pricing of a non-valued security and a
 restricted or non-public security. While fair value pricing may be more
 commonly used with foreign equity securities, it may also be used with,
among other things, thinly-traded domestic securities or fixed-income 
    securities. As a general principle, the current "fair value" of a security
     is the amount that the owner might reasonably expect to receive for it upon
its current sale. The funds may use a systematic fair valuation model 
provided by an independent pricing service to value foreign equity    
securities in order to adjust for                                     

23

P-->N-1A29th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 29th
stale pricing, which may occur between the close of certain foreign   
exchanges and the close of the NYSE.                                  

  Due to the subjective nature of fair value pricing, a fund's value for a
 particular security may be different from the last quoted market price.
 Fair value pricing may reduce arbitrage activity involving the frequent
buying and selling of mutual fund shares by investors seeking to take 
advantage of a perceived lag between a change in the value of a fund's
    portfolio securities and the reflection of such change in that fund's NAV,
     as further described in the "Excessive Trading" section of this Prospectus.
    While funds that invest in foreign securities may be at a greater risk for
arbitrage activity, such activity may also arise in funds which do not
    invest in foreign securities, for example, when trading in a security held
by a fund is halted and does not resume prior to the time the fund    
calculates its NAV (referred to as "stale pricing"). Funds that hold  
    thinly-traded securities, such as certain small-capitalization securities,
     may be subject to attempted use of arbitrage techniques. To the extent that
  a fund's valuation of a security is different from the security's market
    value, short-term arbitrage traders buying and/or selling shares of a fund
may dilute the NAV of that fund, which negatively impacts long-term   
    shareholders. The funds' fair value pricing and excessive trading policies
   and procedures may not completely eliminate short-term trading in certain
omnibus accounts and other accounts traded through intermediaries.    

     The value of the securities of other open-end funds held by a fund, if any,
will be calculated using the NAV of such open-end funds, and the      
    prospectuses for such open-end funds explain the circumstances under which
  they use fair value pricing and the effects of using fair value pricing.

  All purchases, exchanges, redemptions, or other account activity must be
processed through your financial intermediary or plan sponsor. Your   
financial intermediary or plan sponsor is responsible for promptly    
     transmitting purchase, redemption and other requests to the funds under the
   arrangements made between your financial intermediary or plan sponsor and
its customers. The funds are not responsible for the failure of any   
    financial intermediary or plan sponsor to carry out its obligations to its
customers.                                                            

SHARE CLASSES 

  The funds offer four classes of shares, each representing an interest in
the same portfolio but with differing sales charges, fees, eligibility
requirements and other features. It is important to consult with your 
   financial intermediary representative for additional information on which
  classes of shares, if any, are an appropriate investment choice. Certain
    financial intermediaries may not offer all funds or all classes of shares.
 Contact your financial intermediary or refer to your plan documents for
 instructions on how to purchase, exchange, or redeem shares. Individual
   investors cannot invest directly in the funds and barring certain limited
exceptions, the are only available to U.S. citizens or residents.     

24

P-->N-1A30th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 30th
  If your financial intermediary offers more than one class of shares, you
     should carefully consider which class (or classes) of shares is appropriate
for your investments objectives and needs. Certain classes have higher
  expenses than others, which may lower the return on your investment. For
further details, please see the Statement of Additional Information.  

CLASS A SHARES                                                        

Class A shares are generally offered through financial intermediary   
   platforms including, but not limited to, traditional brokerage platforms,
mutual fund wrap fee programs, bank trust platforms and retirement    
  platforms. Class A shares may be offered without an initial sales charge
through certain retirement platforms and through certain financial    
     intermediary platforms. Shares are traditionally offered without an initial
   sales charge to fee-based broker-dealers or financial advisors, primarily
on their wrap account platforms where such broker-dealers or financial
     advisors impose additional fees for services connected to the wrap account.
    Class A shares allow for payment of up to 0.25% of net assets to financial
   intermediaries for providing distribution, or other, shareholder services
to their clients. In addition, Class A shares allow for payment to    
   financial intermediaries for providing administrative services, including
 recordkeeping, subaccounting, order processing for omnibus or networked
accounts, or other shareholder services provided on behalf of their   
clients.

Class P shares are available through certain financial intermediary platforms   
including, but not limited to, mutual fund wrap fee programs, managed account   
programs, asset allocation programs, bank trust platforms and certain retirement

DISTRIBUTION, SERVICING AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEES 

DISTRIBUTION AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICING PLANS 

In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
the funds have adopted shareholder servicing plans for Class A shares and Class 
C shares (the "Class A Plan" and "Class C Plan," respectively, or collectively  
the "Plans"). Under the Plans, the funds may pay Destra Investments LLC ("Destra
Investments"), the funds' distributor, a fee for the sale and distribution      
and/or shareholder servicing of Class A

shares and Class C shares based on average daily net assets of each, up to the  
following annual rates:                                                         

--------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
Class                                   Maximum annual 12b-1 Fee for the funds  
--------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
Class A shares                          0.25%                                   
Class C shares                          1.00% *                                 
--------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------

*    Up to 0.75% of this fee is for distribution services and up to 0.25% of    
this fee is for shareholder services.                                 

Under the terms of the Plans, the funds are authorized to make payments to      
Destra Investments for remittance to retirement plan service providers,         
broker-dealers, bank trust departments, financial advisors and other financial  
intermediaries, as compensation for distribution and/or shareholder services    
performed by such entities for their customers who are investors in the funds.  

Such financial intermediaries may from time to time be required to meet certain 
criteria in order to be eligible receive 12b-1 fees. Under the adopted Class C  
Plan, Destra Investments is entitled to retain all fees paid for the first 12   
months on any investment in Class C shares in order to recoup prior expenses    
incurred with respect to the payment of commissions on sales of Class C shares. 
Accordingly, financial intermediaries will become eligible for compensation     
under the Class C Plan beginning in the 13th month following the purchase of    
Class C shares. Notwithstanding Destra Investment's right to retain these fees, 
it may, pursuant to a written agreement between Destra Investments and a        
particular financial intermediary, pay such financial intermediary 12b-1 fees   
prior to the 13th month following the purchase of Class C shares. Destra        
Investments is entitled to retain some or all fees payable under the Plans in   
certain circumstances, including when there is no broker of record or when      
certain qualification standards have not been met by the broker of record.      
Because 12b-1 fees are paid out of the funds' assets on an ongoing basis, over  
time they will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than  
paying other types of sales charges.                                            

ADMINISTRATIVE FEES                                                             

For Class A shares, Class C shares and Class I shares, certain intermediaries   
may charge administrative fees for certain services such as recordkeeping,      
subaccounting, order processing for omnibus or networked accounts or other      
shareholder services provided by intermediaries on behalf of the shareholders of
the funds. Order processing which may be subject to such administrative fees    
includes the submission of transactions through the National Securities Clearing
Corporation ("NSCC") or similar systems, as well as those processed on a manual 
basis with Destra Investments. These administrative fees are paid by the shares 
of the funds to Destra Investments, who then reimburses eligible intermediaries.
Because the form and amount charged varies by intermediary, the amount of the   
administrative fees borne by the class is an average of all fees charged by     
applicable intermediaries. In the event an intermediary receiving payments from 
Destra Investments on behalf of the funds converts from a networking structure  
to an omnibus

account structure, or otherwise experiences increased costs, fees borne by the  
shares may increase.                                                            

For Class P shares, the funds pay an annual administrative fee of 0.25% of net  
assets for administrative services, including recordkeeping, subaccounting or   
other shareholder services provided by intermediaries on behalf of the          
shareholders of the funds. These administrative fees are paid by the shares of  
the funds to Destra Investments, who then reimburses eligible intermediaries.   
Destra Investments or its affiliates may also pay administrative fees to the    
extent the that fees charged by intermediaries exceed the 0.25% of net assets   
charged to the funds.                                                           

PURCHASES 

Generally, purchases of Class A shares and Class C shares may only be made      
through institutional channels such as financial intermediaries and retirement  
platforms. Purchases of Class P shares may be made only through financial       
intermediaries. Generally, purchases of Class I shares may only be made through 
financial intermediaries and by certain institutional investors. Contact your   
financial intermediary or refer to your plan documents for information on how to
invest in each fund, including additional information on minimum initial or     
subsequent investment requirements. Your financial intermediary may charge you a
separate or additional fee for processing purchases of shares. The funds have   
only authorized certain financial intermediaries to receive purchase orders on  
the funds' behalf. As discussed under "Payments to Financial Intermediaries,"   
Destra and its affiliates, pursuant to agreements with certain intermediaries,  
may pay commissions or fees to those intermediaries for their role in the       
attraction and retention of shareholders to the funds. When considering fund    
recommendations made by these intermediaries, you should consider such          
arrangements.                                                                   

Because the funds are not intended for excessive trading, each fund reserves the
right to reject any purchase order, including exchange purchases, for any       
reason. For more information about the funds' policy on excessive trading, refer
to "Excessive Trading."                                                         

In compliance with the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing           
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA
PATRIOT Act"), your financial intermediary is required to verify certain        
information on your account application as part of its Anti-Money Laundering    
Program. In addition to your full name, and date of birth, you will be required 
to provide your social security number and permanent street address to assist in
verifying your identity. Some financial intermediaries may also require that you
provide other documents that help to establish your identity. Until verification
of your identity is made, your financial intermediary may temporarily limit     
additional share purchases or even close an account if they are unable to verify
a shareholder's identity. Please contact your financial intermediary if you need
assistance when completing your application or would like to receive additional 
information regarding the USA PATRIOT Act or the intermediary's Anti-Money      
Laundering Program.

MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS                                     

There is a [$2,500] minimum investment requirement per fund account for the     
purchase of Class A shares, Class C shares and Class P shares; however, certain 
tax-deferred retirement accounts or UGMA/UTMA accounts are subject to a [$500]  
minimum. Investors in a defined contribution plan through a third party         
administrator should refer to their plan document or contact their plan         
administrator for additional information. Accounts which are a part of certain  
wrap programs may not be subject to these minimums. Investors should refer to   
their intermediary for additional information.                                  

There is a [$1 million] minimum investment requirement for institutional        
investors purchasing Class I shares. Institutional investors generally may meet 
the minimum investment amount by aggregating multiple accounts within the same  
fund. Accounts offered through an intermediary institution must meet the minimum
investment requirements of $[500] for tax-deferred accounts and $[2,500] for    
other account types. Directors, officers and employees of Destra and its        
affiliates, as well as Trustees and officers of the funds, may purchase Class I 
shares through certain financial intermediaries' institutional platforms. For   
more information about this program and eligibility requirements, please contact
a Destra representative at [_____________]. There may be exceptions to these    
minimums for certain tax-deferred, tax-qualified and retirement plans and       
accounts held through wrap programs. For additional information, contact your   
intermediary, plan sponsor, administrator or a Destra representative.           

If your fund account is valued at less than $100, other than as a result solely 
of depreciation in share value, the applicable fund may request that your       
financial intermediary close your account. Each fund reserves the right to make 
such a request annually, however, certain accounts held through intermediaries  
may not be subject to closure due to the policies of the intermediaries. You may
receive written notice from your intermediary to increase your account balance  
to the required minimum to avoid having your account closed. If you hold Class I
shares directly with a fund, you may receive written notice prior to the closure
of your fund account so that you may increase your account balance to the       
required minimum. Please note that you may incur a tax liability as a result of 
a redemption upon closure of your account.                                      

There is a [$500,000] maximum on any single purchase of Class C shares. For     
investors who wish to purchase more than [$500,000] worth of shares, the sales  
charge and expense structure of Class A shares may be more advantageous.        

Each fund reserves the right to change the amount of these minimums or maximums 
from time to time or to waive them in whole or in part.                         

PERIODIC PURCHASE PLAN                                                          

You may arrange for periodic purchases by authorizing your financial            
intermediary (or a Destra representative, if you hold Class I shares directly   
with a fund) to debit the amount of your investment from your bank account on a 
day or days you specify. Contact your

Not all financial intermediaries offer this plan.                               

INITIAL SALES CHARGE                                                            
CLASS A SHARES                                                                  

The initial sales charge imposed on the purchase of Class A shares is based on  
the amount invested, as set forth in the table below. The proceeds of any       
applicable sales charge are allocated between Destra Investments and your       
financial intermediary. The table below sets forth the amount of the applicable 
sales charge as a percentage of offering price and net amount invested. The     
dollar amount of your initial sales charge is calculated as the difference      
between the public offering price and the net asset value of those shares. Since
the offering price is calculated to two decimal places using standard rounding  
criteria, the number of shares purchased and the dollar amount of your sales    
charge as a percentage of the offering price and of your net investment may be  
higher or lower than the amounts set forth in the table depending on whether    
there was a downward or upward rounding.

(1)  Offering Price includes the initial sales charge.                          

(2)  A contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% may apply to Class A shares    
   purchased without an initial sales charge if redeemed within 12 months of
purchase.                                                             

Destra Investments may pay financial intermediaries commissions on purchases of 
Class A shares as follows:                                                      

o    1.00% on amounts from $1,000,000 to $4,000,000;                  

o    plus 0.50% on amounts greater than $4,000,000 to $10,000,000;    

o    plus 0.25% on amounts over $10,000,000.                          

The purchase totals eligible for these commissions are aggregated on a rolling  
one year basis so that the rate payable resets to the highest rate annually.    

QUALIFYING FOR A REDUCTION OR WAIVER OF CLASS A SHARES SALES CHARGE             

You may be able to lower or eliminate your sales charge on Class A shares under 
certain circumstances. For example, when purchasing new Class A or Class C      
shares, you can combine Class A shares and Class C shares you already own       
(either in these funds or certain other Destra funds) with your current purchase
to take advantage of the

breakpoints in the sales charge schedule as set forth above. The circumstances  
under which you may combine such ownership of shares and purchases are described
below. If you would like more information on aggregating shares to take         
advantage of the breakpoints, please contact your financial intermediary.       

Class A shares of the funds may be purchased without an initial sales charge by 
the following persons (and their spouses and children under 21 years of age):   
(i) registered representatives and other employees of intermediaries that have  
selling agreements with Destra Investments to sell Class A shares; (ii)         
directors, officers and employees of Destra Capital Management LLC and its      
affiliates; and (iii) trustees and officers of the funds. Additionally, certain 
financial intermediaries have entered into an agreement with Destra Investments 
that allows the waiver of the initial sales charge on purchases of Class A      
shares. In order to obtain a sales charge discount, you should inform your      
financial intermediary of other accounts in which there are fund holdings       
eligible to be aggregated to meet a sales charge breakpoint. These other        
accounts may include the accounts described under "Aggregating Accounts." It is 
possible that your financial intermediary will require documentation, such as an
account statement, to prove that the accounts are eligible for aggregation. The 
Letter of Intent described below requires historical cost information in certain
circumstances. You should retain records necessary to show the price you paid to
purchase fund shares, as the funds, their agents, or your financial intermediary
may not retain this information.                                                

RIGHT OF ACCUMULATION. You may purchase Class A shares of a fund at a reduced   
sales charge determined by aggregating the dollar amount of the new purchase    
(measured by the offering price) and the total prior day's net asset value (net 
amount invested) of all eligible shares (as set forth herein) and applying the  
sales charge applicable to such aggregate amount. Shares eligible for           
aggregation include Class A shares of the fund and of certain other classes     
(Class A shares and Class C shares of the Destra Investment Trust) of Destra    
funds then held by you, or held in accounts identified under "Aggregating
Accounts." In order for your purchases and holdings to be aggregated for        
purposes of qualifying for such discount, they must have been made through one  
financial intermediary and you must provide sufficient information to your      
financial intermediary at the time of purchase to permit verification that the  
purchase qualifies for the reduced sales charge. The right of accumulation is   
subject to modification or discontinuance at any time with respect to all shares
purchased thereafter.                                                           

LETTER OF INTENT. You can also reduce the sales charge on the purchase of Class 
A shares by signing a Letter of Intent indicating your intention to purchase    
$50,000 or more of Class A shares (including Class A shares in other series of  
the Destra Investment Trust) over a 13-month period. The term of the Letter of  
Intent will commence upon the date you sign the Letter. In order to apply       
purchases towards the intended amount, ou must refer to such Letter when placing
all orders.                                                                     

When calculating the applicable sales charge to a purchase pursuant to a Letter 
of Intent, the amount of investment for purposes of applying the sales load     
schedule includes: (i) the historical cost (what you actually paid for the      
shares at the time of purchase, including

any sales charges) of all Class A shares acquired during the term of the Letter 
of Intent; minus (ii) the value of any redemptions of Class A shares made during
the term of the Letter of Intent. Each investment made during the period        
receives the reduced sales charge applicable to the total amount of the         
investment goal. A portion of shares purchased may be held in escrow to pay for 
any applicable sales charge. If the goal is not achieved within the period, you 
must pay the difference between the sales charges applicable to the purchases   
made and the charges previously paid, or an appropriate number of escrowed      
shares will be redeemed. Please contact your financial intermediary to obtain a 
Letter of Intent application.                                                   

AGGREGATING ACCOUNTS. In calculating the applicable breakpoint and sales charge 
on large purchases or those made through the exercise of a Letter of Intent or  
right of accumulation, investments made by you (and your spouse and children    
under age 21) may be aggregated if made for your own account(s) and/or certain  
other accounts such as: trust accounts established by the above individuals (or 
the accounts of the primary beneficiary of the trust if the person who          
established the trust is deceased); solely controlled business accounts; and    
single participant retirement plans.                                            

To receive a reduced sales charge under the right of accumulation or a Letter of
Intent, you must notify your financial intermediary of any eligible accounts    
that you, your spouse and your children under age 21 have at the time of your   
purchase.                                                                       

You may access information regarding sales loads, breakpoint discounts and      
purchases of the funds' shares, free of charge, and in a clear and prominent    
format, on our website at destracapital.com, and by following the appropriate   
hyperlinks to the specific information.                                         

COMMISSION ON CLASS C SHARES                                                    

Destra Investments may pay to your financial intermediary a commission rate of  
1.00% of the net asset value of the Class C shares purchased. Service providers 
to qualified plans will not be eligible to receive this commission if they      
receive 12b-1 fees from the time of initial investment of qualified plan assets 
in Class C shares.                                                              

EXCHANGES 

Contact your financial intermediary (or a Destra representative at              
[____________] for Class I shares) or consult your plan documents for           
information on exchanging into other funds in the Destra Investment Trust. As   
with any investment, be sure to read the prospectus of the fund into which you  
are exchanging. An exchange from one fund to another is generally a taxable     
transaction (except for certain tax-deferred accounts). Exchanges are subject to
the following conditions:                                                       

 o    You may generally exchange shares of a fund for shares of the same
          class of any other fund in the Destra Investment Trust offered through
your financial intermediary or qualified plan.              

32

P-->N-1A38th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 38th
    o    You may also exchange shares of one class for another class of shares
      within the same fund, provided the eligibility requirements of the
         class of shares to be received are met. Same-fund exchanges will only
        be processed in instances where there is no CDSC on the shares to be
         exchanged and no initial sales charge on the shares to be received. A
       fund's fees and expenses differ between share classes so you should
        carefully read the Prospectus for the share class you are interested
     in prior to investing in that share class. Contact your financial
          intermediary (or a Destra representative at [____________] for Class I
      shares) or consult your plan documents for additional information.

o    You must meet the minimum investment amount for each fund.       

 o    Each fund reserves the right to reject any exchange request and to
modify or terminate the exchange privilege at any time.     

     o    For Class P shares and Class I shares, an exchange of shares from each
         fund held for 90 days or less may be subject to the funds' redemption
        fee. For more information on redemption fees, including a discussion
         of the circumstances in which the redemption fee may not apply, refer
to "Redemption Fee."                                        

    o    The exchange privilege is not intended as a vehicle for short-term or
    excessive trading. A fund may suspend or terminate your exchange
          privilege if you make more than one round trip in the fund in a 90-day
          period and may bar future purchases in the fund or other Destra funds.
        The funds will work with intermediaries to apply the funds' exchange
        limit. However, the funds may not always have the ability to monitor
          or enforce the trading activity in such accounts. For more information
     about the funds' policy on excessive trading, refer to "Excessive
Trading."
WAIVER OF SALES CHARGES                                                         

The sales charge will be waived on any Class A shares received through an       
exchange of Class A shares of another fund of the Destra Investment Trust. Class
A shares or Class C shares received through an exchange of Class A shares or    
Class C shares, respectively, of another fund of the Destra Investment Trust    
will not be subject to any applicable CDSC at the time of the exchange. Any CDSC
applicable to redemptions of Class A shares or Class C shares will continue to  
be measured on the shares received by exchange from the date of your original   
purchase. For more information about the CDSC, please refer to "Redemptions."   
Unlike Class A shares, Class C shares do not have any front-end sales charges;  
however, their higher annual operating expenses mean that over time, you could  
end up paying more than the equivalent of the maximum allowable front-end sales 
charge.                                                                         

REDEMPTIONS 

Generally, redemptions may only be effected only through financial              
intermediaries, retirement platforms and certain institutional investors, as    
applicable and describe above. It is possible that your financial intermediary  
charges a processing or service fee in connection with the redemption of shares.
Contact your financial intermediary or refer to the appropriate plan documents  
for details.                                                                    

33

P-->N-1A39th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 39th
Shares of each fund are redeemable on any business day on which the fund's NAV  
is calculated. Redemptions are duly processed at the NAV next calculated after  
receipt of the redemption order by a fund or its agents. Redemption proceeds,   
less any applicable CDSC for Class A shares or Class C shares or any applicable 
redemption fee for Class P shares and Class I shares, will normally be sent the 
business day following receipt of the redemption order.                         

Each fund reserves the right to postpone payment of redemption proceeds for up  
to seven (7) calendar days. Additionally, the right to require the funds to     
redeem their shares may be suspended, or the date of payment may be postponed   
beyond seven calendar days, whenever: (i) trading on the NYSE is restricted, as 
determined by the SEC, or the NYSE is closed (except for holidays and weekends);
(ii) the SEC permits such suspension and so orders; or (iii) an emergency exists
as determined by the SEC so that disposal of securities or determination of NAV 
is not reasonably practicable.                                                  

If your fund account is valued at less than $100, other than as a result solely 
of depreciation in share value, the applicable fund may request that your       
financial intermediary close your account. Each fund reserves the right to make 
such a request annually, however, certain accounts held through intermediaries  
may not be subject to closure due to the policies of the intermediaries. You may
receive written notice from your intermediary to increase your account balance  
to the required minimum to avoid having your account closed. If you hold Class I
shares directly with a fund, you may receive written notice prior to the closure
of your fund account so that you may increase your account balance to the       
required minimum. Please note that you may incur a tax liability as a result of 
a redemption upon closure of your account.                                      

REDEMPTIONS IN-KIND                                                             

Shares normally will be redeemed for cash, although each fund retains the right 
to redeem some or all of its shares in-kind under unusual circumstances, in     
order to protect the interests of remaining shareholders, to accommodate a      
request by a particular shareholder that does not adversely affect the interests
of the remaining shareholders, or in connection with the liquidation of a fund, 
by delivery of securities selected from its assets at its discretion. However,  
each fund is required to redeem shares solely for cash up to the lesser of      
$250,000 or 1% of the NAV of that fund during any 90-day period for any one     
shareholder. Should redemptions by any shareholder exceed such limitation, a    
fund will have the option of redeeming the excess in cash or in-kind. In-kind   
payment means payment will be made in portfolio securities rather than cash. If 
this occurs, the redeeming shareholder might incur brokerage or other           
transaction costs to convert the securities to cash.                            

PERIODIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN                                                        

You may arrange for periodic redemptions by authorizing your financial          
intermediary (or a Destra representative, if you hold Class I shares directly   
with a fund) to redeem a specified amount from your account on a day or days you
specify. Any resulting CDSC                                                     

34

for Class A shares or Class C shares may be waived through financial            
intermediaries that have entered into an applicable agreement with Destra       
Investments. The maximum annual rate at which shares subject to a CDSC may be   
redeemed, pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan, without paying a CDSC, is   
12% of the net asset value of the account. Certain other terms and conditions,  
including minimum amounts, may apply. Contact your financial intermediary, or a 
Destra representative for Class I shares, for details. Not all financial        
intermediaries offer this plan.                                                 

CLASS A SHARES AND CLASS C SHARES CDSC                                          

A 1.00% CDSC may be deducted with respect to Class A shares purchased without an
initial sales charge if redeemed within 12 months of purchase, unless any of the
listed CDSC waivers apply. A 1.00% CDSC will be deducted with respect to Class C
shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase, unless a CDSC waiver applies. The 
CDSC will be based on the lower of the original purchase price or the value of  
the redemption of the Class A shares or Class C shares redeemed, as applicable. 

CDSC WAIVERS                                                                    

There are certain cases in which you may be exempt from a CDSC charged to Class 
A shares and Class C shares. Among others, these include:                       

o    Upon the death or disability of an account owner;                

   o    Retirement plans and certain other accounts held through a financial
intermediary that has entered into an agreement with Destra 
Investments to waive CDSCs for such accounts;               

  o    Retirement plan shareholders taking required minimum distributions;

  o    The redemption of Class A shares or Class C shares acquired through
reinvestment of fund dividends or distributions;            

     o    The portion of the redemption representing appreciation as a result of
     an increase in NAV above the total amount of payments for Class A
    shares or Class C shares during the period during which the CDSC
applied; or                                                 

    o    If a fund chooses to liquidate or involuntarily redeem shares in your
account.                                                    

To keep the CDSC as low as possible, Class A shares or Class C shares not       
subject to any CDSC will be redeemed first, followed by shares held longest.    

CLASS A SHARES REINSTATEMENT PRIVILEGE                                          

After you have redeemed Class A shares, you have a one-time right to reinvest   
the proceeds within 90 days of the redemption date at the current NAV (without  
an initial sales charge). You will not be reimbursed for any CDSC paid on your  
redemption of Class A shares.                                                   

CLASS P SHARES AND CLASS I SHARES REDEMPTION FEE                                

35

P-->N-1A41st Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 41st
Redemptions (and exchanges) of Class P shares and Class I shares from a fund    
held for 90 days or less may be subject to a fund's redemption fee equalling    
2.00% of the net asset value of redemption proceeds. This fee is paid directly  
to the fund rather than to Destra and is designed to deter excessive short-term 
trading and to offset the brokerage commissions, market impact and other costs  
associated with changes in the fund's asset level and cash flow due to          
short-term money movements in and out of the fund.                              

Certain intermediaries have agreed to charge the funds' redemption fee on their 
customers' accounts. In this case, the amount of the fee and the holding period 
will generally be consistent with the funds'. However, due to operational       
requirements, the intermediaries' methods for tracking and calculating the fee  
may differ in some respects from the funds'.                                    

The redemption fee does not apply to certain types of accounts held through     
intermediaries, including: (i) certain employer-sponsored retirement plans; (ii)
certain broker wrap fee and other fee-based programs; (iii) certain omnibus     
accounts where the omnibus account holder does not have the operational         
capability to impose a redemption fee on its underlying customers' accounts; and
(iv) certain intermediaries that do not have or report to the funds sufficient  
information to impose a redemption fee on their customers' accounts.            

In addition, the redemption fee does not apply to: (i) premature distributions  
from retirement accounts that are exempt from IRS penalty due to the disability 
of or medical expenses incurred by the shareholder; (ii) required minimum       
distributions from retirement accounts; (iii) return of excess contributions in 
retirement accounts; (iv) redemptions resulting in the settlement of an estate  
due to the death of the shareholder; (v) redemptions through an automated       
systematic withdrawal or exchange plan; (vi) redemptions by participants of an  
employer-sponsored automatic enrollment 401(k) plan who properly elect a refund 
of contributions within 90 days of being automatically enrolled in such plan;   
(vii) involuntary redemptions imposed by Destra; and (viii) reinvested          
distributions (dividends and capital gains). For same-fund share class          
exchanges, no redemption fee will be applied based on the exchange transaction. 
However, to the extent an intermediary is applying a redemption fee, the        
redemption fee will be imposed on a subsequent underlying shareholder-initiated 
sale of shares after the exchange. When cooperation from a financial            
intermediary is necessary to impose a redemption fee on its customers' accounts,
different or additional exemptions may be applied by the financial intermediary.
Redemption fees may be waived under certain circumstances involving involuntary 
redemptions imposed by intermediaries. Contact your financial intermediary, a   
Destra representative (1-800-333-1181) for Class I shares, or refer to your plan
documents for more information on whether the redemption fee is applied to your 
shares.                                                                         

In addition to the circumstances previously noted, each fund reserves the right 
to waive the redemption fee at its discretion where it believes such waiver is  
in the best interests of the fund, including but not limited to when it         
determines that imposition of the redemption fee is not necessary to protect the
fund from the effects of short-term trading.                                    

36

P-->N-1A42nd Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 42nd
In addition, each fund reserves the right to modify or eliminate the redemption 
fee or waivers at any time. If there is a material change to the funds'         
redemption fee, the funds will notify you at least 60 days prior to the         
effective date of the change.

Section 4   General Information

DISTRIBUTIONS 

In order to avoid taxation of the funds, the Internal Revenue Code requires each
fund to distribute all or substantially all of its net investment income and any
net capital gains realized on its investments at least annually. A fund's income
from certain dividends, interest and any net realized short-term capital gains  
are paid to shareholders as ordinary income dividends. Certain dividend income  
may be reported to shareholders as "qualified dividend income," which is        
generally subject to reduced rates of taxation. Net realized long-term capital  
gains are paid to shareholders as capital gains distributions, regardless of how
long shares of the fund have been held. Distributions are made at the class     
level, so they may vary from class to class within a single fund.               

DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULE                                                           

Dividends from net investment income and distributions of capital gains are     
normally declared and distributed in December but, if necessary, may be         
distributed at other times as well. The date you receive your distribution may  
vary depending on how your intermediary processes trades. Please consult your   
intermediary for details.                                                       

HOW DISTRIBUTIONS AFFECT A FUND'S NAV                                           

Distributions are paid to shareholders as of the record date of a distribution  
of a fund, regardless of how long the shares have been held. Dividends and net  
capital gains that have not yet been distributed are included in each fund's    
daily NAV. The share price of a fund drops by the amount of the distribution,   
net of any subsequent market fluctuations. For example, assume that on December 
31, a fund declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share. If the fund's  
share price was $10.00 on December 30, the fund's share price on December 31    
would be $9.75, barring market fluctuations. You should be aware that           
distributions from a taxable mutual fund do not increase the value of your      
investment and may create income tax obligations.                               

"BUYING A DIVIDEND" 

If you purchase shares of a fund immediately preceding a distribution, you will 
pay the full price for the shares and receive a portion of the purchase price   
back as a taxable distribution. This is referred to as "buying a dividend." In  
the above example, if you bought shares on December 30, you would have paid     
$10.00 per share. On December 31, the fund would pay you $0.25 per share as a   
dividend and your shares would now be worth $9.75 per share. Unless your account
is set up as a tax-deferred account, dividends paid to you would be included in 
your gross income for tax purposes, even though you may not have participated in
the increase in NAV of the fund. This is true regardless of whether you retain  
or reinvest the dividends. Before buying shares of a fund close to              

38

P-->N-1A44th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 44th
year-end, you should consult with your financial intermediary or tax adviser as 
to potential tax consequences of any distributions that may be paid shortly     
after purchase.                                                                 

For your convenience, distributions of net investment income and net capital    
gains are automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund without any 
sales charge. In order to receive distributions in cash, you should contact your
financial intermediary. Whether reinvested or paid in cash, the distributions   
may be subject to taxes, unless your shares are held in a qualified tax-deferred
plan or account.                                                                

TAXES 

As with any investment, you should consider the tax consequences of investing in
the funds. A "taxable event" occurs any time you sell or exchange shares of a   
fund in a taxable account; for federal income tax purposes, an exchange is      
treated the same as a sale. Depending on the purchase price and the sale price, 
you may have a gain or loss on the transaction; whether the gain or loss is     
long-term or short-term depends on how long you owned the shares. Any tax       
liabilities generated by your transactions are your responsibility and not the  
funds' or the intermediaries.' The following discussion does not apply to       
qualified tax-deferred accounts or other non-taxable entities, nor is it a      
complete analysis of the federal income tax implications of investing in the    
funds. You should consult your tax adviser if you have any questions.           
Additionally, state or local taxes may apply to your investment, depending upon 
the laws of your state of residence.                                            

TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS                                                          

Distributions by the funds are subject to federal income tax, regardless of     
whether the distribution is made in cash or reinvested in additional shares of a
fund. When gains from the sale of a security held by a fund are paid to         
shareholders, the rate at which the gain will be taxed to shareholders depends  
on the length of time the fund held the security. In certain states, a portion  
of the distributions (depending on the sources of a fund's income) may be exempt
from state and local taxes. A fund's net investment income and capital gains are
distributed to (and may be taxable to) those persons who are shareholders of the
fund at the record date of such payments. Although a fund's total net income and
net realized gain are the results of its operations, the per share amount       
distributed or taxable to shareholders is affected by the number of fund shares 
outstanding at the record date. Generally, account tax information will be made 
available to shareholders on or before January 31st of each year. Information   
regarding distributions may also be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.   

Distributions made by a fund to shares purchased through a qualified retirement 
plan that are left to accumulate within the qualified plan generally are not    
taxable. However, withdrawals from qualified plans are generally subject to     
federal income tax at ordinary income rates and, if made before age 591/2, a 10%
penalty tax. The federal income tax status of your investment depends on the    
features of your qualified plan. For further information, please contact your   
plan sponsor.

The funds may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax on all            
distributions and redemptions payable to shareholders who fail to meet certain  
tax qualifications, including: providing their correct taxpayer identification  
number; making certain other required certifications; or those who have been    
notified by the Internal Revenue Service that they are subject to backup        
withholding. The current backup withholding rate provided by the Internal       
Revenue Service is applied.                                                     

TAXATION OF THE FUNDS                                                           

Dividends, interest and some capital gains received by the funds on foreign     
securities may be subject to foreign tax withholding or other foreign taxes. If 
a fund is eligible, it may from year to year make the election permitted under  
Section 853 of the Internal Revenue Code to pass through such taxes to          
shareholders as a foreign tax credit. If such an election is not made, any      
foreign taxes paid or accrued will represent an expense to the funds.           

Certain fund transactions may involve short sales, futures, options, swap       
agreements, hedged investments and other similar transactions. Under certain    
circumstances, such transactions could be subject to special provisions of the  
Internal Revenue Code that, among other things, can potentially affect the      
character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders and utilization of
capital loss carryforwards. The funds will monitor their transactions and may   
make certain tax elections and use certain investment strategies where          
applicable in order to mitigate the effect of these tax provisions. Certain     
transactions or strategies utilized by a fund may generate unqualified income   
that can impact an investor's taxes.                                            

The funds do not expect to pay any federal income or excise taxes because they  
intend to meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. These         
requirements include annual distribution of all net investment income and net   
capital gains. It is important that the funds meet these requirements so that   
any earnings on your investment will not be subject to federal income taxes     
twice. Funds that invest in partnerships may be subject to state tax            
liabilities.                                                                    

PAYMENTS TO FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES 

From its own assets, Destra or its affiliates may pay selected brokerage firms  
or other financial intermediaries that sell Class A shares and Class C shares of
the Destra funds for distribution, marketing, promotional, or related services. 
Such payments may be based on gross sales, assets under management, or          
transactional charges, or on a combination of these factors. The amount of these
payments is determined from time to time by Destra, may be substantial and may  
differ for different financial intermediaries. Payments based primarily on sales
create an incentive to make new sales of shares, while payments based on assets 
create an incentive to retain previously sold shares. Sales- and asset-based    
payments currently range up to 25 basis points on sales and up to 20 basis      
points on average annual net assets of shares held through the intermediary.    
These rates are subject to change.                                              

40

P-->N-1A46th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 46th
Payments based on transactional charges may include the payment or reimbursement
of all or a portion of "ticket charges." Ticket charges are fees charged to     
salespersons purchasing through a financial intermediary firm in connection with
mutual fund purchases, redemptions, or exchanges. The payment or reimbursement  
of ticket charges creates an incentive for salespersons of an intermediary to   
sell shares of Destra funds over shares of funds for which there is lesser or no
payment or reimbursement of any applicable ticket charge. Destra and its        
affiliates consider a number of factors in making payments to financial         
intermediaries, including the distribution capabilities of the intermediary, the
overall quality of the relationship, expected gross and/or net sales generated  
by the relationship, redemption and retention rates of assets held through the  
intermediary, the willingness of the intermediary to cooperate with Destra's    
marketing efforts, access to sales personnel and the anticipated profitability  
of sales through the institutional relationship. These factors may change from  
time to time. Currently, these payments are limited to the top 100 distributors,
measured by sales or expected sales of shares of the Destra funds. Broker-dealer
firms currently receiving or expected to receive these fees are listed in the   
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

In addition, for all shares, Destra Investments or their affiliates may pay     
fees, from their own assets, to brokerage firms, banks, financial advisors,     
retirement plan service providers and other financial intermediaries for        
providing other marketing or distribution-related services. Destra Investments  
may also pay fees, from their own assets, for recordkeeping, subaccounting,     
transaction processing and other shareholder or administrative services         
(including payments for processing transactions via National Securities Clearing
Corporation or other means) in connection with investments in the Destra funds. 
These fees are in addition to any fees that may be paid by the Destra funds for 
these types of services or other services.                                      

Destra or its affiliates may also share certain marketing expenses with         
intermediaries, or pay for or sponsor informational meetings, seminars, client  
awareness events, support for marketing materials, sales reporting or business  
building programs for such intermediaries to raise awareness of the funds. Such 
payments may be in addition to, or in lieu of, sales-based, asset-based and     
transaction-based payments. These payments are intended to promote the sales of 
Destra funds and to reimburse financial intermediaries, directly or indirectly, 
for the costs that they or their salespersons incur in connection with          
educational seminars, meetings and training efforts about the Destra funds to   
enable the intermediaries and their salespersons to make suitable               
recommendations, provide useful services and maintain the necessary             
infrastructure to make the Destra funds available to their customers.           

The receipt of (or prospect of receiving) sales-, asset- and/or                 
transaction-based payments or reimbursements and other forms of compensation    
described above may provide a financial intermediary and its salespersons with  
an incentive to favor sales of Destra funds' shares over sales of other mutual  
funds (or non-mutual fund investments) or to favor sales of one class of Destra 
funds' shares over sales of another of Destra funds' share class. The receipt of
these payments may cause certain financial intermediaries to elevate the        
prominence of the Destra funds within such financial intermediary's             

41

P-->N-1A47th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 47th
organization by, for example, placement on a list of preferred or recommended   
funds and/or the provision of preferential or enhanced opportunities to promote 
the Destra funds in various ways within such financial intermediary's           
organization.                                                                   

The payment arrangements described above will not change the price an investor  
pays for shares nor the amount that a Destra fund receives to invest on behalf  
of the investor. You should consider whether such arrangements exist when       
evaluating any recommendations from an intermediary to purchase or sell shares  
of the funds and when considering which share class of a fund is most           
appropriate for you. Please contact your financial intermediary or plan sponsor 
for details on such arrangements.                                               

AVAILABILITY OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS INFORMATION 

The [Mutual Fund Holdings Disclosure Policies and Procedures] adopted by Destra 
and all mutual funds managed within the Destra fund complex are designed to be  
in the best interests of the funds and to protect the confidentiality of the    
funds' portfolio holdings. The following describes policies and procedures with 
respect to the disclosure of portfolio holdings.                                

     o    Full Holdings. Each fund is required to disclose its complete holdings
          in the quarterly holdings report on Form N-Q within 60 days of the end
          of each fiscal quarter, and in the annual report and semiannual report
      to fund shareholders. These reports (i) are available on the SEC's
         website at http://www.sec.gov; (ii) may be reviewed and copied at the
       SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. (information on the
         Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330); and
         (iii) are available without charge, upon request, by calling a Destra
       representative at 1-800-[_________] (toll free). Portfolio holdings
       (excluding cash investments, derivatives, short positions and other
  investment positions), consisting of at least the names of the
          holdings, are generally available on a calendar quarter-end basis with
          a 30-day lag. Holdings are generally posted approximately two business
days thereafter under the [_____________] of each fund at   
destracapital.com.                                          

     o    Top Holdings. Each fund's top portfolio holdings, in order of position
       size and as a percentage of a fund's total portfolio, are available
        monthly with a 15-day lag and on a calendar quarter-end basis with a
     15-day lag. Most funds disclose their top ten portfolio holdings.
 However, certain funds disclose only their top five portfolio
holdings.                                                   

o    Other Information. Each fund may occasionally provide security   
       breakdowns (e.g., industry, sector, regional, market capitalization
      and asset allocation), top performance contributors/detractors and
    specific portfolio level performance attribution information and
      statistics monthly with a 30-day lag and on a calendar quarter-end
basis with a 15-day lag.                                    

Full portfolio holdings will remain available on the Destra website at least    
until a Form N-CSR or Form N-Q is filed with the SEC for the period that        
includes the date as of which the website information is current. Funds disclose
their short positions, if applicable, only to the extent required in regulatory 
reports. Destra may exclude from

publication all or any portion of portfolio holdings or change the time periods 
of disclosure as deemed necessary to protect the interests of the Destra funds. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, exceptions to the [Mutual Fund Holdings      
Disclosure Policies and Procedures] may be made by Destra's Chief Investment    
Officer(s) or their delegates. Such exceptions may be made without prior notice 
to shareholders. A summary of the funds' portfolio holdings disclosure policies 
and procedures, which includes a discussion of any exceptions, is contained in  
the funds' Statement of Additional Information.                                 

EXCESSIVE TRADING 
EXCESSIVE TRADING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES                                       

The Trustees have adopted policies and procedures with respect to short-term and
excessive trading of fund shares ("excessive trading"). The funds are intended  
exclusively for long-term investment and will take reasonable steps to attempt  
to detect and deter short-term and excessive trading. Transactions placed in    
violation of the funds' exchange limits or excessive trading policies may be    
cancelled or revoked by the fund by the next business day following receipt by  
the fund. In enforcing these policies and procedures, the trading history of    
accounts determined to be under common ownership or control within any of the   
Destra funds may be considered. As described below, however, the funds may not  
be able to identify all instances of excessive trading or completely eliminate  
the possibility of excessive trading. In particular, it may be difficult to     
identify excessive trading in certain omnibus accounts and other accounts traded
through intermediaries. By their nature, omnibus accounts, in which purchases   
and redemptions of the funds' shares by multiple investors are aggregated by the
intermediary and presented to the funds on a net basis, may effectively conceal 
the identity of individual investors and their transactions from the funds and  
their agents. This makes the elimination of excessive trading in the accounts   
impractical without the assistance of the intermediary.                         

Among other safeguards, the funds attempt to deter excessive trading through the
following methods:                                                              

o    exchange limitations as described under "Exchanges;"             

o    trade monitoring;                                                

o    fair valuation of securities as described under "Pricing of Fund 
Shares;" and                                                

    o    redemption fees as described under "Redemption Fee" (where applicable
on certain classes of the funds).                           

Generally, a purchase and redemption of shares from the same fund within 90     
calendar days (a "round trip") may result in enforcement of a fund's excessive  
trading policies and procedures with respect to future purchase orders, provided
that each fund reserves the right to reject any purchase request as explained   
above.                                                                          

The funds constantly monitor for patterns of shareholder frequent trading. Any  
investor who makes more than one round trip in a fund over a 90-day period may  
be subject to                                                                   

43

P-->N-1A49th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 49th
suspension or termination of such investor's exchange privileges. The fund may  
also bar future purchases into the fund and other Destra funds by such investor.
The funds' excessive trading policies generally do not apply to (i) a money     
market fund, although money market funds at all times reserve the right to      
reject any purchase request (including exchange purchases) for any reason       
without prior notice, and (ii) transactions in the Destra funds by a Destra     
"fund of funds," which is a fund that primarily invests in other Destra mutual  
funds.                                                                          

The funds' Trustees may approve from time to time a redemption fee to be imposed
by any Destra fund, subject to 60 days' notice to shareholders of that fund.    

Omnibus transactions placed through a financial intermediary for numerous       
investors may cause such investors to be treated as a group for purposes of the 
funds' excessive trading policies and procedures and may be rejected in whole or
in part by a fund. The funds, however, cannot always identify or reasonably     
detect excessive trading that may be facilitated by financial intermediaries or 
made difficult to identify through the use of omnibus accounts. Because certain 
intermediaries transmit purchase, exchange and redemption orders to the funds as
a net aggregation of numerous investor orders, the funds may have difficulty    
curtailing such activity. Transactions accepted by a financial intermediary in  
violation of the funds' excessive trading policies may be cancelled or revoked  
by a fund by the next business day following receipt by that fund.              

In an attempt to detect and deter excessive trading in omnibus accounts, the    
funds or their agents may require intermediaries to impose restrictions on the  
trading activity of accounts traded through those intermediaries. Such          
restrictions may include, but are not limited to: requiring that trades be      
placed by U.S. mail; prohibiting future purchases by investors who have recently
redeemed fund shares; requiring intermediaries to report information about      
customers who purchase and redeem large amounts; and other similar restrictions.
The funds' ability to impose such restrictions with respect to accounts traded  
through particular intermediaries may vary depending on the systems'            
capabilities, applicable contractual and legal restrictions and cooperation of  
those intermediaries. Certain transactions in fund shares, such as periodic     
rebalancing through intermediaries (no more frequently than every 60 days) or   
those which are made pursuant to systematic purchase, exchange, or redemption   
programs generally do not raise excessive trading concerns and normally do not  
require application of the funds' methods to detect and deter excessive trading.

Each fund also reserves the right to reject any purchase request (including     
exchange purchases) by any investor or group of investors for any reason without
prior notice, including, in particular, if the trading activity in the          
account(s) is deemed to be disruptive to a fund. For example, a fund may refuse 
a purchase order if the fund's portfolio managers and/or investment personnel   
believe they would be unable to invest the money effectively in accordance with 
the fund's investment policies or the fund would otherwise be adversely affected
due to the size of the transaction, frequency of trading, or other factors.     

44

P-->N-1A50th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 50th
The funds' policies and procedures regarding excessive trading may be modified  
at any time by the funds' Trustees.                                             

EXCESSIVE TRADING RISKS                                                         

Excessive trading may present risks to a fund's long-term shareholders and      
investment objectives. Excessive trading into and out of a fund may disrupt     
portfolio investment strategies, may create taxable gains to remaining fund     
shareholders and may increase fund expenses, all of which may negatively impact 
investment returns for all remaining shareholders.                              

Funds that invest in foreign securities may be at a greater risk for excessive  
trading. Investors may attempt to take advantage of anticipated price movements 
in securities held by a fund based on events occurring after the close of a     
foreign market that may not be reflected in the fund's NAV (referred to as      
"price arbitrage"). Such arbitrage opportunities may also arise in funds which  
do not invest in foreign securities, for example, when trading in a security    
held by a fund is halted and does not resume prior to the time the fund         
calculates its NAV (referred to as "stale pricing"). Funds that hold            
thinly-traded securities, such as certain small-capitalization securities, may  
be subject to attempted use of arbitrage techniques. To the extent that a fund's
valuation of a security differs from the security's market value, short-term    
arbitrage traders may dilute the NAV of a fund, which negatively impacts        
long-term shareholders. Although the funds have adopted fair valuation policies 
and procedures intended to reduce the funds' exposure to price arbitrage, stale 
pricing and other potential pricing inefficiencies, under such circumstances    
there is potential for short-term arbitrage trades to dilute the value of fund  
shares.                                                                         

Although the funds take steps to detect and deter excessive trading pursuant to 
the policies and procedures described in this Prospectus and approved by the    
Trustees, there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be      
effective in limiting excessive trading in all circumstances. For example, the  
funds may be unable to completely eliminate the possibility of excessive trading
in certain omnibus accounts and other accounts traded through intermediaries.   
Omnibus accounts may effectively conceal the identity of individual investors   
and their transactions from the funds and their agents. This makes the funds'   
identification of excessive trading transactions in the funds through an omnibus
account difficult and makes the elimination of excessive trading in the account 
impractical without the assistance of the intermediary. Although the funds      
encourage intermediaries to take necessary actions to detect and deter excessive
trading, some intermediaries may be unable or unwilling to do so, and           
accordingly, the funds cannot eliminate completely the possibility of excessive 
trading. Shareholders that invest through an omnibus account should be aware    
that they may be subject to the policies and procedures of their financial      
intermediary with respect to excessive trading in the funds.

FUND HISTORY                                                                    

       Each Fund is a separate investment portfolio of the Destra Investment
Trust (the "Trust"), an open-end management investment company organized as a   
Massachusetts business trust on May 25, 2010. Each Fund is diversified          
and represents shares of beneficial interest in a separate portfolio of         
securities and other assets, with its own investment objective, policies and    
strategies.                                                                     

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 

         The investment objective and certain fundamental investment policies of
the Funds are described in the Prospectus for the Funds. The fundamental        
investment policies, together with the investment objective of each Fund and    
certain other policies specifically identified in the Prospectus, cannot be     
changed without approval by holders of a "majority of the Fund's outstanding    
voting shares." As defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended    
(the "1940 Act"), this means the vote of (i) 67% or more of the Fund's shares   
present at a meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the Fund's shares are  
present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the Fund's shares,    
whichever is less. Certain matters under the 1940 Act, which must be submitted  
to a vote of the holders of the outstanding voting securities of a series, shall
not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the holders
of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of each series affected by such  
matter. Each Fund, as a fundamental policy, may not, without the approval of the
holders of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting shares:                  

    1. Purchase or sell real estate or real estate limited partnership
    interests, provided, however, that a Fund may invest in securities
    secured by real estate or interests therein or issued by companies
       which invest in real estate or interests therein when consistent with
 the other policies and limitations described in the Prospectus.

  2. Invest in physical commodities unless acquired as a result of
  ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not
      prevent a Fund from purchasing or selling foreign currency, options,
     futures contracts, options on futures contracts, forward contracts,
     swaps, caps, floors, collars, securities on a forward-commitment or
   delayed-delivery basis, and other similar financial instruments).

        3. Engage in the business of underwriting securities issued by others,
  except to the extent that, in connection with the disposition of
securities, a Fund may be deemed an underwriter under federal 
securities law.                                               

     4. Lend any security or make any other loan except (i) as otherwise
 permitted under the 1940 Act, (ii) pursuant to a rule, order or
  interpretation issued by the SEC or its staff, (iii) through the
         purchase of a portion of an issue of debt securities in accordance with
     a Fund's investment objective, policies and limitations, or (iv) by
         engaging in repurchase agreements with respect to portfolio securities.

      5. Issue any senior security except as otherwise permitted (i) under
         the 1940 Act or (ii) pursuant to a rule, order or interpretation issued
by the SEC or its staff.                                      

      6. Borrow money, except as otherwise permitted under the 1940 Act or
      pursuant to a rule, order or interpretation issued by the SEC or its
    staff, including (i) as a temporary measure, (ii) by entering into
reverse repurchase agreements, and (iii) by lending portfolio 
       securities as collateral. For purposes of this investment limitation,
        the purchase or sale of options, futures contracts, options on futures
      contracts, forward contracts, swaps, caps, floors, collars and other
similar financial instruments shall not constitute borrowing. 

       7. Invest more than 5% of its total assets (taken at market value) in
         securities of any one issuer, other than obligations issued by the U.S.
       Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or purchase more than
        10% of the voting securities of any one issuer, with respect to 75% of
a Fund's total assets.                                        

  8. Invest more than 25% of its total assets in the securities of
         companies primarily engaged in any one industry provided that: (i) this
      limitation does not apply to obligations issued or guaranteed by the
U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities; and (ii) 
        municipalities and their agencies and authorities are not deemed to be
industries.                                                   

        The above percentage limits are based upon asset values at the time of
the applicable transaction; accordingly, a subsequent change in asset values    
will not affect a transaction that was in compliance with the investment        
restrictions at the time such transaction was effected.                         

     The following non-fundamental investment restrictions apply to each
Fund (except where noted otherwise) and may be changed with respect to each Fund
by a vote of a majority of the Board. No Fund may:                              

   1. Invest more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities,
       including time deposits and repurchase agreements that mature in more
than seven days; or                                           

         2. Purchase securities on margin or effect short sales, except that (i)
       a Fund may obtain such short term credits as may be necessary for the
clearance of purchases or sales of securities.                

         All percentage limitations on investments will apply at the time of the
making of an investment and shall not be considered violated unless an excess or
deficiency occurs or exists immediately after and as a result of such           
investment. Except for the investment restrictions listed above as fundamental  
or to the extent designated as such in the Prospectus with respect to a Fund,   
the other investment policies described in this Statement of Additional         
Information or in the Prospectus are not fundamental and may be changed by      
approval of the Trustees.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RISKS 

       In addition to the discussion of investment strategies and risks that
appears in the Prospectus, each Fund may (except where indicated otherwise) also
implement the following strategies.                                             

EQUITY SECURITIES                                                               

        Under normal market conditions, each Funds invests primarily in equity
securities, which include common stocks and other securities with equity        
characteristics. Common stocks represent units of ownership in a company and    
typically have voting rights and earn dividends. Dividends on common stocks are 
not fixed but are declared at the discretion of a company's board. Equity       
securities may also include equity securities of investment companies and       
exchange-traded funds.                                                          

General Risks of Investing in Stocks                                            

     While investing in stocks allows shareholders to participate in the
benefits of owning a company, such shareholders must accept the risks of        
ownership. Unlike bondholders, who have preference to a company's earnings and  
cash flow, preferred stockholders, followed by common stockholders in order of  
priority, are entitled only to the residual amount after a company meets its    
other obligations. For this reason, the value of a company's stock will usually 
react more strongly to actual or perceived changes in the company's financial   
condition or prospects than its debt obligations. Stockholders of a company that
fares poorly can lose money.                                                    

        Stock markets tend to move in cycles with short or extended periods of
rising and falling stock prices. The value of a company's stock may fall because
of:                                                                             

     o   Factors that directly relate to that company, such as decisions made by
        its management or lower demand for the company's products or services;

   o   Factors affecting an entire industry, such as increases in production
costs; and                                                    

     o   Changes in financial market conditions that are relatively unrelated to
 the company or its industry, such as changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates or inflation rates.                   

      Because preferred securities are generally junior to debt securities
and other obligations of the issuer, deterioration in the credit quality of the 
issuer will cause greater changes in the value of a preferred security than in a
more senior debt security with similar stated yield characteristics.            

   The Fund may invest in securities of issuers with small or medium
market capitalizations. Any investment in small and medium capitalization       
companies involves greater risk and price volatility than that customarily      
associated with investments in larger, more established companies. This         
increased risk may be due to the greater business risks of their small or medium
size, limited markets and financial resources, narrow product lines and frequent
lack of management depth. The securities of small and medium capitalization     
companies are often                                                             

4

traded in the over-the-counter market, and might not be traded in volumes       
typical of securities traded on a national securities exchange. Thus, the       
securities of small and medium capitalization companies are likely to be less   
liquid and subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than securities of
larger, more established companies.                                             

NON-U.S. SECURITIES                                                             

    The Funds may invest in a variety of securities issued by non-U.S.
companies. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve risks in addition to the  
usual risks inherent in domestic investments, including currency risk. The value
of a non-U.S. security in U.S. dollars tends to decrease when the value of the  
U.S. dollar rises against the non-U.S. currency in which the security is        
denominated and tends to increase when the value of the U.S. dollar falls       
against such currency.                                                          

     Non-U.S. securities are affected by the fact that in many countries
there is less publicly available information about issuers than is available in 
the reports and ratings published about companies in the United States and      
companies may not be subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial      
reporting standards. Other risks inherent in non-U.S. investments include       
expropriation; confiscatory taxation; withholding taxes on dividends and        
interest; less extensive regulation of non-U.S. brokers, securities markets and 
issuers; diplomatic developments; and political or social instability. Non-U.S. 
economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in various  
respects, and many non-U.S. securities are less liquid and their prices tend to 
be more volatile than comparable U.S. securities. From time to time, non-U.S.   
securities may be difficult to liquidate rapidly without adverse price effects. 

The Funds may also invest in non-U.S. securities by purchasing
depositary receipts, denominated in U.S. dollars, including American Depositary 
Receipts ("ADRs"), European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs"), Global Depositary     
Receipts ("GDRs") or other securities representing indirect ownership interests 
in the securities of non-U.S. companies, including New York Shares. Generally,  
ADRs, in registered form, are denominated in U.S. dollars and are designated for
use in the U.S. securities markets, while EDRs and GDRs are typically in bearer 
form and may be denominated in non-U.S. currencies and are designed for use in  
European and other markets. ADRs are receipts typically issued by a U.S. bank or
trust company evidencing ownership of the underlying non-U.S. security. ADRs,   
EDRs and GDRs are deemed to have the same classification as the underlying      
securities they represent, except that ADRs, EDRs and GDRs shall be treated as  
indirect non-U.S. investments. Thus, an ADR, EDR or GDR representing ownership  
of common stock will be treated as common stock. ADRs, EDRs and GDRs do not     
eliminate all of the risks associated with directly investing in the securities 
of non-U.S. companies, such as changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates.     
However, by investing in ADRs rather than directly in non-U.S. companies' stock,
a Fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period. Some ADRs may not be 
sponsored by the issuer.                                                        

       Other types of depositary receipts include American Depositary Shares
("ADSs"), Global Depositary Certificates ("GDCs") and International Depositary  
Receipts ("IDRs"). ADSs are shares issued under a deposit agreement representing
the underlying ordinary shares that trade in the issuer's home market. An ADR,  
described above, is a certificate that represents a number of                   

5 

P-->N-1A60th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 60th
ADSs. GDCs and IDRs are typically issued by a non-U.S. bank or trust company,   
although they may sometimes also be issued by a U.S. bank or trust company. GDCs
and IDRs are depositary receipts that evidence ownership of underlying          
securities issued by either a non-U.S. or a U.S. corporation.                   

Depositary receipts may be available through "sponsored" or   
"unsponsored" facilities. A sponsored facility is established jointly by a      
depositary and the issuer of the security underlying the receipt. An unsponsored
facility may be established by a depositary without participation by the issuer 
of the security underlying the receipt. There are greater risks associated with 
holding unsponsored depositary receipts. For example, if a Fund holds an        
unsponsored depositary receipt, it will generally bear all of the costs of      
establishing the unsponsored facility. In addition, the depositary of an        
unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder
communications received from the issuer of the deposited security. Whether a    
sponsored or unsponsored facility, there is no assurance that either would pass 
through to the holders of the receipts voting rights with respect to the        
deposited securities.                                                           

  In considering whether to invest in the securities of a non-U.S.
company, the portfolio managers consider such factors as the characteristics of 
the particular company, differences between economic trends, and the performance
of securities markets within the United States and those within other countries.
The portfolio managers also consider factors relating to the general economic,  
governmental and social conditions of the country or countries where the company
is located.                                                                     

        Securities transactions conducted outside the United States may not be
regulated as rigorously as in the United States, may not involve a clearing     
mechanism and related guarantees, and are subject to the risk of governmental   
actions affecting trading in, or the prices of, non-U.S. securities, currencies 
and other instruments. The value of such positions also could be adversely      
affected by (i) other complex non-U.S. political, legal and economic factors,   
(ii) lesser availability than in the United States of data on which to make     
trading decisions, (iii) delays in a Fund's ability to act upon economic events 
occurring in non-U.S. markets during non-business hours in the United States,   
(iv) the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures   
and the margin requirements than in the United States, (v) currency exchange    
rate changes, and (vi) lower trading volume and liquidity.                      

    Currency Risk. By investing in non-U.S. securities, a Fund will be
subject to currency risk, which is the risk that an increase in the U.S. dollar 
relative to the non-U.S. currency will reduce returns or portfolio value.       
Generally, when the U.S. dollar rises in value relative to a non-U.S. currency, 
a Fund's investment in securities denominated in that currency will lose value  
because its currency is worth fewer U.S. dollars. On the other hand, when the   
value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to a non-U.S. currency, a Fund's        
investments denominated in that currency will tend to increase in value because 
that currency is worth more U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between the U.S.   
dollar and non-U.S. currencies depend upon such factors as supply and demand in 
the currency exchange markets, international balance of payments, governmental  
intervention, speculation, and other economic and political conditions. Although
a Fund values its assets daily in U.S. dollars, the Fund may not convert its    
holdings of non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars on a daily basis. A Fund may    
incur conversion costs when it converts                                         

6 

P-->N-1A61st Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 61st
its holdings to another currency. Non-U.S. exchange dealers may realize a profit
on the difference between the price at which A Fund buys and sells currencies.  
Each Fund may engage in non-U.S. currency exchange transactions in connection   
with its portfolio investments. A Fund conducts its non-U.S. currency exchange  
transactions either on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the spot rate prevailing in 
the non-U.S. currency exchange market or through forward contracts to purchase  
or sell non-U.S. contracts.                                                     

DOLLAR ROLLS, WHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES OR FORWARD COMMITMENT TRANSACTIONS         

        Each Fund may engage in dollar rolls or purchase or sell securities on
a when-issued or forward commitment basis. The purchase or sale of when-issued  
securities enables an investor to hedge against anticipated changes in interest 
rates and prices by locking in an attractive price or yield. The price of       
when-issued securities is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase or sell  
is made, but delivery and payment for the when-issued securities takes place at 
a later date, normally one to two months after the date of purchase. During the 
period between purchase and settlement, no payment is made by the purchaser to  
the issuer and no interest accrues to the purchaser. Such transactions therefore
involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines    
prior to the settlement date or if the value of the security to be sold         
increases prior to the settlement date. A sale of a when-issued security also   
involves the risk that the other party will be unable to settle the transaction.
A dollar roll is a contract to sell mortgage-backed securities as collateral    
against a commitment to repurchase similar, but not identical, mortgage-backed  
securities on a specified future date. The other party to the contract is       
entitled to all principal, interest, and prepayment cash flows while it holds   
the collateral. Each Fund maintains with its custodian a segregated account     
containing high-grade liquid securities in an amount at least equal to the      
forward purchase obligation. Dollar rolls are a type of forward commitment      
transaction. Purchases and sales of securities on a forward commitment basis    
involve a commitment to purchase or sell securities with payment and delivery to
take place at some future date, normally one to two months after the date of the
transaction. As with when-issued securities, these transactions involve certain 
risks, but they also enable an investor to hedge against anticipated changes in 
interest rates and prices. Forward commitment transactions are executed for     
existing obligations, whereas in a when-issued transaction, the obligations have
not yet been issued. When purchasing securities on a when-issued or forward     
commitment basis, a segregated account of liquid assets at least equal to the   
value of purchase commitments for such securities will be maintained until the  
settlement date.                                                                

OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES                                                      

Each Fund may invest in other investment companies (including 
affiliated investment companies) to the extent permitted by the Investment      
Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"), or exemptive relief granted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Investing in another investment     
company subjects a Fund to the same risks associated with investing in the      
securities held by the applicable investment company. In addition, the benefit  
of investing in another investment company is largely dependent on the skill of 
the investment adviser of the underlying company and whether the associated fees
and costs involved with investing in such company are offset by the potential   
gains. Investing in another investment

company, including those affiliated with the Funds or their investment adviser, 
may subject a Fund to duplicative fees and expenses that may be payable to the  
adviser or its affiliates.                                                      

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                                 

        Each Fund may loan securities to broker-dealers or other institutional
investors. Securities loans will not be made if, as a result, the aggregate     
amount of all outstanding securities loans by a Fund exceeds 33 1/3% of its     
total assets (including the market value of collateral received). For purposes  
of complying with a Fund's investment policies and restrictions, collateral     
received in connection with securities loans is deemed an asset of the Fund to  
the extent required by law. For all Funds that engage in securities lending, the
investment advisor receives compensation for administrative and oversight       
functions with respect to securities lending. The amount of such compensation   
depends on the income generated by the loan of the securities. A Fund continues 
to receive dividends or interest, as applicable, on the securities loaned and   
simultaneously earns either interest on the investment of the cash collateral or
fee income if the loan is otherwise collateralized. As with other extensions of 
credit, there are risks of delay in recovery or even loss of rights in the      
collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially.              

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                           

        Each Fund may enter into repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement
is an agreement under which securities are acquired by a Fund from a securities 
dealer or bank subject to resale at an agreed upon price on a later date. The   
acquiring Fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a      
repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and the Fund is delayed or     
prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral securities.   
However, the investment adviser or the sub-advisors, as applicable, attempt to  
minimize this risk by entering into repurchase agreements only with financial   
institutions that are deemed to be of good financial standing.                  

PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERINGS                                                     

       Each Fund may purchase securities in private placement offerings made
in reliance on the "private placement" exemption from registration afforded by  
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"), and resold to qualified
institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act ("Section 4(2)          
securities"). The Funds will not invest more than 15% of their respective net   
assets in Section 4(2) securities and illiquid securities unless the investment 
advisor or the sub-advisor, as applicable, determines, by continuous reference  
to the appropriate trading markets and pursuant to guidelines approved by the   
Trust's Board of Trustees ("Board") that any Section 4(2) securities held by    
such Fund in excess of this level are at all times liquid.                      

TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE POSITION                                                    

     While assuming a temporary defensive position, a Fund may invest in
cash or cash equivalent short-term investment grade obligations, including:     
obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities;         
corporate debt securities, such as commercial

paper, master demand notes, loan participation interests, medium-term notes and 
funding agreements; Yankeedollar and Eurodollar bank certificates of deposit,   
time deposits, and bankers' acceptances; asset-backed securities; and repurchase
agreements involving the foregoing obligations. Eurodollar obligations are U.S. 
dollar obligations issued outside the United States by domestic or foreign      
entities, while Yankeedollar obligations are U.S. dollar obligations issued     
inside the United States by foreign entities. There is generally less publicly  
available information about foreign issuers and there may be less governmental  
regulation and supervision of foreign stock exchanges, brokers and listed       
companies. Foreign issuers may use different accounting and financial standards,
and the addition of foreign governmental restrictions may affect adversely the  
payment of principal and interest on foreign investments. In addition, not all  
foreign branches of United States banks are supervised or examined by regulatory
authorities as are United States banks, and such branches may not be subject to 
reserve requirements.

MANAGEMENT 

   The management of the Trust, including general supervision of the
duties performed for the Funds under the Investment Management Agreement, is the
responsibility of the Board of Trustees. The Trust has three trustees, one of   
whom is an "interested person" (as the term "interested person" is defined in   
the 1940 Act) and two of whom are not interested persons (referred to herein as 
"independent trustees"). None of the independent trustees has ever been a       
trustee, director or employee of, or consultant to, Destra Advisors LLC or its  
affiliates. The names, business addresses and birthdates of the trustees and    
officers of the Funds, their principal occupations and other affiliations during
the past five years, the number of portfolios each oversees and other           
directorships they hold are set forth below. The trustees of the Trust are      
trustees of 3 Destra-sponsored open-end funds (the "Destra Funds").

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RISK OVERSIGHT                                   

         The Board of Trustees (the "Board" or "Board of Trustees") oversees the
operations and management of the Destra Funds, including the duties performed   
for the Destra Funds by the investment advisor.

 Listed below for each current Board member are the experiences,

Destra Funds.

CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS 

       A control person is a shareholder that 1) beneficially owns, directly
or through controlled companies, more than 25% of the voting securities of a    
company, 2) acknowledges or asserts the existence of control, or 3) has a final 
adjudication under section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act that control exists. A       
principal shareholder is any person who owns of record or beneficially 5% or    
more of the outstanding shares of any class of a Fund. Shareholders owning      
voting securities in excess of 25% may determine the outcome of any matter      
affecting and voted on by shareholders of a Fund. As of the date of this        
Statement of Additional Information, neither of the Funds had any outstanding   
shares.                                                                         

        As of [____________], 2010, the officers and trustees of the Funds, in

      Ownership of Securities. Because the Funds are newly launched, as of

         Information regarding how each Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio
securities during the most recent period ended June 30 will be available without
charge by calling (800) [__-____] or by accessing the SEC's website at          
http://www.sec.gov.                                                             

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 
[TO BE PROVIDED.]                                             

NET ASSET VALUE 

        As stated in the Funds' Prospectus, the net asset value ("NAV") of the
shares of each class of each Fund is determined once each day the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") is open, as of the close of its regular trading session   
(normally 4:00 p.m., New York time, Monday through Friday). The per share NAV   
for each class of each Fund is computed by dividing the total value of          
securities and other assets allocated to the class, less liabilities allocated  
to that class, by the total number of outstanding shares for the class. In      
determining NAV, securities listed on an Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market,  
and foreign markets are generally valued at the closing prices on such markets. 
If such price is lacking for the trading period immediately preceding the time  
of determination, such securities are valued at their current bid price.        
Municipal securities held by the Funds are traded primarily in the              
over-the-counter markets. Valuations of such securities are furnished by one or 
more pricing services employed by the Funds and approved by the trustees and are
based upon a computerized matrix system or appraisals obtained by a pricing     
service, in each case in reliance upon information concerning market            
transactions and quotations from recognized municipal securities dealers. Other 
securities that are traded on the over-the-counter markets are generally valued 
at their closing bid prices.                                                    

15

P-->N-1A70th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 70th
Foreign securities and currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the       
applicable exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE. Each Fund will     
determine the market value of individual securities held by it by using prices  
provided by one or more professional pricing services which may provide market  
prices to other funds, or, as needed, by obtaining market quotations from       
independent broker-dealers. Short-term securities maturing within 60 days or    
less are valued on an amortized cost basis. Debt securities with a remaining    
maturity of greater than 60 days are valued in accordance with the evaluated bid
price supplied by the pricing service. The evaluated bid price supplied by the  
pricing service is an evaluation that reflects such factors as security prices, 
yields, maturities, and ratings.                                                

         Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are
deemed unreliable are valued at fair value determined in good faith under       
procedures established by and under the supervision of the trustees (the        
"Valuation Procedures"). Circumstances in which fair value pricing may be       
utilized include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant event that may      
affect the securities of a single issuer, such as a merger, bankruptcy, or      
significant issuer specific development; (ii) an event that may affect an entire
market, such as a natural disaster or significant governmental action; (iii) a  
nonsignificant event such as a market closing early or not opening, or a        
security trading halt; and (iv) pricing of a non-valued security and a          
restricted or non-public security. The Funds may use a systematic fair valuation
model provided by an independent third party to value international equity      
securities in order to adjust for stale pricing, which may occur between the    
close of certain foreign exchanges and the NYSE.                                

        Trading in securities on European and Far Eastern securities exchanges
and over-the-counter markets is normally completed well before the close of     
business on each business day in New York (i.e., a day on which the NYSE is     
open). In addition, European or Far Eastern securities trading generally or in a
particular country or countries may not take place on all business days in New  
York. Furthermore, trading takes place in Japanese markets on certain Saturdays 
and in various foreign markets on days which are not business days in New York  
and on which a Fund's NAV is not calculated. A Fund calculates its NAV per      
share, and therefore effects sales, redemptions, and repurchases of its shares, 
as of the close of the NYSE once each day on which the NYSE is open. Such       
calculation may not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the  
prices of the foreign portfolio securities used in such calculation. If an event
that is expected to affect the value of a portfolio security occurs after the   
close of the principal exchange or market on which that security is traded, and 
before the close of the NYSE, then that security may be valued in good faith    
under the Valuation Procedures.                                                 

        To the extent there are any errors in a Fund's NAV calculation, Destra
may, at its discretion, reprocess individual shareholder transactions so that   
each shareholder's account reflects the accurate corrected NAV.                 

PURCHASES 

         With the exception of Class I shares, shares of the Funds can generally
be purchased only through institutional channels such as financial              
intermediaries and retirement platforms. Class I shares may be purchased        
directly with the Funds in certain circumstances as provided in the Funds'      
prospectus. Not all financial intermediaries offer all classes. Shares or       
classes of the

Funds may be purchased without upfront sales charges by certain retirement plans
and clients of investment advisers, but these clients will typically pay        
asset-based fees for their investment advisers' advice, which are on top of the 
Funds' expenses. Certain shares or classes of the Funds may also be purchased   
without upfront sales charges or transactional charges by persons who invest    
through mutual fund "supermarket" programs of certain financial intermediaries  
that typically do not provide investment recommendations or the assistance of an
investment professional.                                                        

     Certain designated organizations are authorized to receive purchase
orders on the Funds' behalf and those organizations are authorized to designate 
their agents and affiliates as intermediaries to receive purchase orders.       
Purchase orders are deemed received by a Fund when authorized organizations,    
their agents, or affiliates receive the order provided that such designated     
organizations or their agents or affiliates transmit the order to the Fund      
within contractually specified periods. The Funds are not responsible for the   
failure of any designated organization or its agents or affiliates to carry out 
its obligations to its customers. In order to receive a day's price, your order 
for any class of Shares must be received in good order by the close of the      
regular trading session of the NYSE as described above in "Net Asset Value."    
Your financial intermediary may charge you a separate or additional fee for     
processing purchases of Shares. Your financial intermediary, plan documents or  
the Funds' Prospectus will provide you with detailed information about investing
in the Funds.                                                                   

       The Trust has established an Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program
(the "Program") as required by the Uniting and Strengthening America by         
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 
2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act"). In order to ensure compliance with this law, the      
Trust's Program provides for the development of internal practices, procedures  
and controls, designation of anti-money laundering compliance officers, an      
ongoing training program, and an independent audit function to determine the    
effectiveness of the Program.                                                   

      Procedures to implement the Program include, but are not limited to,
determining that financial intermediaries have established proper anti-money    
laundering procedures, reporting suspicious and/or fraudulent activity, checking
shareholder names against designated government lists, including the Office of  
Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC"), and a review of all new account applications.   
The Trust does not intend to transact business with any person or entity whose  
identity cannot be adequately verified under the provisions of the USA PATRIOT  
Act.                                                                            

         The Funds do not issue share certificates. Shares will be registered in
the name of the investor or the investor's financial advisor. A change in       
registration or transfer of shares held in the name of a financial advisor may

investor's behalf.                                                              

CLASS A SHARES                                                                  

    The price you pay for Class A shares is the public offering price,
which is the NAV next determined after a Fund or its agent receives in good     
order your order plus an initial sales charge,

if applicable, based on the amount invested as set forth in the table. The Fund 
receives the NAV. The sales charge is allocated between your financial          
intermediary and Destra Investments LLC, the Funds' distributor, as shown in the
table, except where Destra Investments LLC, in its discretion, allocates up to  
the entire amount to your financial intermediary. Sales charges, as expressed as
a percentage of offering price, a percentage of your net investment, and as a   
percentage of the sales charge reallowed to financial intermediaries, are shown 
in the table. The dollar amount of your initial sales charge is calculated as   
the difference between the public offering price and the NAV of those shares.   
Since the offering price is calculated to two decimal places using standard     
rounding criteria, the number of shares purchased and the dollar amount of your 
sales charge as a percentage of the offering price and of your net investment   
may be higher or lower than the amounts set forth in the table depending on     
whether there was a downward or upward rounding. Although you pay no initial    
sales charge on purchases of $1,000,000 or more, Destra Investments LLC may pay,
from its own resources, a commission to your financial intermediary on such     
investments.

        As described in the Prospectus, there are several ways you can combine

   Class C shares of the Funds are purchased at the NAV per share as
determined at the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE next         
occurring after a purchase order is received in good order by a Fund or its     
authorized agent.                                                               

      Destra Investments LLC may compensate your financial intermediary at
the time of sale at a commission rate of up to 1.00% of the NAV of the Class C  
shares purchased. Service providers to qualified plans will not receive this    
amount if they receive 12b-1 fees from the time of initial investment of        
qualified plan assets in Class C shares.

CLASS P SHARES AND CLASS I SHARES                                               

         Class P shares and Class I shares of the Funds are purchased at the NAV
per share as determined at the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE 
next occurring after a purchase order is received in good order by a Fund or its
authorized agent.                                                               

DISTRIBUTION AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICING PLANS 
CLASS A SHARES                                                                  

As described in the Prospectus, Class A shares have adopted   
distribution and shareholder servicing plans (the "Class A Plan") in accordance 
with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. The Class A Plan is a compensation type plan
and permits the payment at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the average daily   
net assets of Class A shares of a Fund for activities that are primarily        
intended to result in the sale and/or shareholder servicing of Class A shares of
such Fund, including, but not limited to, printing and delivering prospectuses, 
statements of additional information, shareholder reports, proxy statements, and
marketing materials related to Class A shares to prospective and existing       
investors; providing educational materials regarding Class A shares; providing  
facilities to answer questions from prospective and existing investors about the
Funds; receiving and answering correspondence; complying with federal and state 
securities laws pertaining to the sale of Class A shares; assisting investors in
completing application forms and selecting dividend and other account options;  
and any other activities for which "service fees" may be paid under Rule 2830 of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") Conduct Rules.      
Payments under the Class A Plan is not tied exclusively to actual distribution  
and shareholder service expenses, and the payments may exceed distribution and  
shareholder service expenses actually incurred. Payments are made to Destra     
Investments LLC, the Funds' distributor, who may make ongoing payments to       
financial intermediaries based on the value of Fund shares held by such         
intermediaries' customers.                                                      

CLASS C SHARES                                                                  

As described in the Prospectus, Class C shares have adopted a 
distribution and shareholder servicing plan (the "Class C Plan") in accordance  
with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. The Class C Plan is a compensation type plan
and permits the payment at an annual rate of up to 0.75% of the average daily   
net assets of Class C shares of a Fund for activities which are primarily       
intended to result in the sale of Class C shares of such Fund. In addition, the 
Class C Plan permits the payment of up to 0.25% of the average daily net assets 
of Class C shares of a Fund for shareholder servicing activities including, but 
not limited to, providing facilities to answer questions from existing investors
about the Funds; receiving and answering correspondence; assisting investors in 
changing dividend and other account options and any other activities for which  
"service fees" may be paid under Rule 2830 of the FINRA Conduct Rules. Payments 
under the Class C Plan are not tied exclusively to actual distribution and      
shareholder service expenses, and the payments may exceed distribution and      
shareholder service expenses actually incurred.

      Destra Investments LLC is entitled to retain all fees paid under the
Class C Plan for the first 12 months on any investment in Class C shares to     
recoup its expenses with respect to the payment of commissions on sales of Class
C shares. Financial intermediaries will become eligible for compensation under  
the Class C Plan beginning in the 13th month following the purchase of Class C  
shares, although Destra Investments LLC may, pursuant to a written agreement    
between Destra Investments LLC and a particular financial intermediary, pay such
financial intermediary 12b-1 fees prior to the 13th month following the purchase
of Class C shares.                                                              

        The Plans and any Rule 12b-1 related agreement that is entered into by
the Funds in connection with the Plans will continue in effect for a period of  
more than one year only so long as continuance is specifically approved at least
annually by a vote of a majority of the trustees, and of a majority of the      
trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the     
Trust and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of 
the Plans or any related agreements ("12b-1 Trustees"). All material amendments 
to any Plan must be approved by a majority vote of the trustees, including a    
majority of the 12b-1 Trustees, at a meeting called for that purpose. In        
addition, any Plan may be terminated as to a Fund at any time, without penalty, 
by vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of that class of that Fund or by
vote of a majority of the 12b-1 Trustees.                                       

REDEMPTIONS 

     Redemptions, like purchases, may generally be effected only through
institutional channels such as financial intermediaries and retirement          
platforms. In certain circumstances, Class I shares may be redeemed directly    
with the Funds. Certain designated organizations are authorized to receive      
redemption orders on the Funds' behalf and those organizations are authorized to
designate their agents and affiliates as intermediaries to receive redemption   
orders. Redemption orders are deemed received by a Fund when authorized         
organizations, their agents, or affiliates receive the order. The Funds are not 
responsible for the failure of any designated organization or its agents or     
affiliates to carry out its obligations to its customers.                       

       Shares normally will be redeemed for cash, although each Fund retains
the right to redeem some or all of its shares in-kind under unusual             
circumstances, in order to protect the interests of remaining shareholders, to  
accommodate a request by a particular shareholder that does not adversely affect
the interests of the remaining shareholders, or in connection with the          
liquidation of a Fund, by delivery of securities selected from its assets at its
discretion. If shares are redeemed in-kind, the redeeming shareholder may incur 
brokerage costs in converting the assets to cash. The method of valuing         
securities used to make redemptions in-kind will be the same as the method of   
valuing portfolio securities described under "Net Asset Value" and such         
valuation will be made as of the same time the redemption price is determined.  

        The Funds reserve the right to postpone payment of redemption proceeds
for up to seven calendar days. Additionally, the right to require the Funds to  
redeem their shares may be suspended, or the date of payment may be postponed   
beyond seven calendar days, whenever: (i) trading on the NYSE is restricted, as 
determined by the SEC, or the NYSE is closed (except for                        

20

holidays and weekends); (ii) the SEC permits such suspension and so orders; or  
(iii) an emergency exists as determined by the SEC so that disposal of          
securities or determination of NAV is not reasonably practicable.               

CLASS A SHARES                                                                  

       A contingent deferred sales charge ("CDSC") of 1.00% will be deducted
with respect to Class A shares purchased without a sales load and redeemed      
within 12 months of purchase, unless waived, as discussed in the Prospectus. Any
applicable CDSC will be 1.00% of the lesser of the original purchase price or   
the value of the redemption of the Class A shares redeemed.                     

CLASS C SHARES                                                                  

 A CDSC of 1.00% will be deducted with respect to Class C shares
redeemed within 12 months of purchase, unless waived, as discussed in the       
Prospectus. Any applicable CDSC will be 1.00% of the lesser of the original     
purchase price or the value of the redemption of the Class C shares redeemed.   

CLASS T SHARES AND CLASS I SHARES                                               

 A redemption fee of 2.00% will be deducted from a shareholder's
redemption proceeds with respect to Class T shares and Class I shares of a Fund 
redeemed within 90 days of purchase, unless waived, as discussed in the         
Prospectus.                                                                     

PROCESSING OR SERVICE FEES                                                      

       Broker-dealers may charge their customers a processing or service fee
in connection with the purchase or redemption of Fund shares. Each individual   
dealer determines and should disclose to its customers the amount and           
applicability of such a fee. Processing or service fees typically are fixed,    
nominal dollar amounts and are in addition to the sales and other charges       
described in the Prospectus and this Statement of Additional Information.       
Consult your broker-dealer for specific information about any processing or     
service fees you may be charged.                                                

TAX MATTERS 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS                                                      

  This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning shares of the Funds. This section is current as of the   
date of this Statement of Additional Information. Tax laws and interpretations  
change frequently, and this summary does not describe all of the tax            
consequences to all taxpayers. For example, this summary generally does not     
describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a          
broker-dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this  
section does not describe your state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences. This  
federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the     
Funds. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions set     
forth in this section. In addition, Funds' counsel was not asked to review, and 
has not reached a

conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be 
deposited in a Fund. Consequently, this summary may not be sufficient for you to
use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law. As with any    
investment, you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from  
your own tax professional.                                                      

     Fund Status. The Funds intend to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the federal tax laws. If a Fund qualifies as a regulated         
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
Fund generally will not pay federal income taxes.                               

 Qualification as a Regulated Investment Company. As a regulated
investment company, each Fund will not be subject to federal income tax on the  
portion of its investment company taxable income, as that term is defined in the
Code, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain   
(i.e., the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital     
loss) that it distributes to shareholders, provided that it distributes at least
90% of its net investment company taxable income for the year (the "Distribution
Requirement") and satisfies certain other requirements of the Code that are     
described below. Each Fund also intends to make such distributions as are       
necessary to avoid the otherwise applicable 4% non-deductible excise tax on     
certain undistributed earnings.                                                 

        In addition to satisfying the Distribution Requirement, each Fund must
derive at least 90% of its gross income from (1) dividends, interest, certain   
payments with respect to loans of stock and securities, gains from the sale or  
disposition of stock, securities or non-U.S. currencies and other income        
(including but not limited to gains from options, futures or forward contracts) 
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, and (2) net income derived from an interest in "qualified publicly  
traded partnerships" (as such term is defined in the Code). Each Fund must also 
satisfy an asset diversification test in order to qualify as a regulated        
investment company. Under this test, at the close of each quarter of a Fund's   
taxable year, (1) 50% or more of the value of the Fund's assets must be         
represented by cash, United States government securities, securities of other   
regulated investment companies, and other securities, with such other securities
limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the  
value of the Fund's assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such 
issuer and (2) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund's assets may be       
invested in securities of (a) any one issuer (other than U.S. government        
securities or securities of other regulated investment companies), or of two or 
more issuers which the Fund controls and which are engaged in the same, similar 
or related trades or businesses or (b) in the securities of one or more         
"qualified publicly traded partnerships" (as such term is defined in the Code). 

Distributions. Fund distributions are generally taxable. After the end
of each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates a Fund's          
distributions into two categories, ordinary income distributions and capital    
gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your      
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, during 2010, certain    
ordinary income distributions received from a Fund may be taxed at the capital  
gains tax rates. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as       
long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. To   
determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must  
calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering
all of your other taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, a Fund 
may make                                                                        

22

P-->N-1A77th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 77th
distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will 
generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions from a    
Fund is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional   
shares or receive them in cash. The income from a Fund that you must take into  
account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a 
deferred sales fee, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat distributions 
made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 of the        
previous year. Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,"
income from a Fund may also be subject to a new 3.8 percent "medicare tax"      
imposed for taxable years beginning after 2012. This tax will generally apply to
your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain        
threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples filing     
joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.                   

        Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns shares generally
will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many   
dividends received from a Fund, because the dividends received deduction is     
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.  
However, certain ordinary income dividends on shares that are attributable to   
qualifying dividends received by a Fund from certain corporations may be        
designated by the Fund as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.  

      If You Sell or Redeem Shares. If you sell or redeem your shares, you
will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your shares from the amount   
you receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your shares is generally equal
to the cost of your shares, generally including sales charges. In some cases,   
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your shares.  

     Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the
maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15%         
(generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). These     
capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before  
January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum       
marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and  
the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term gains from most property acquired   
after December 31, 2000, with a holding period of more than five years. Net     
capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term capital loss
for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period   
for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the holding period for 
the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you purchase your      
shares to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a capital gain 
dividend from a Fund and sell your share at a loss after holding it for six     
months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to   
the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital     
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. In addition, the Code treats certain capital gains as      
ordinary income in special situations.                                          

Taxation of Certain Ordinary Income Dividends. Ordinary income
dividends received by an individual shareholder from a regulated investment     
company such as a Fund are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net  
capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements 
are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to

qualifying dividends received by the Fund itself. These special rules relating  
to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from regulated investment companies
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011. Each Fund    
will provide notice to its shareholders of the amount of any distribution which 
may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the new capital   
gains tax rates.                                                                

         In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in the
Prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of Fund securities when you 
redeem shares or when a Fund terminates. This distribution will be treated as a 
sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or   
loss, generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount
of cash received. The Internal Revenue Service could, however, assert that a    
loss may not be currently deducted.                                             

Exchanges. If you exchange shares of your Fund for shares of another
Destra Fund, the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal      
income tax purposes.                                                            

     Deductibility of Fund Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by a
Fund will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases,     
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these Fund expenses as    
income. In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.  
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions  
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                            

        Non-U.S. Tax Credit. If a Fund invests in any non-U.S. securities, the
tax statement that you receive may include an item showing non-U.S. taxes the   
Fund paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include 
your share of the taxes the Fund paid to other countries. You may be able to    
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.                   

         Investments in Certain Non-U.S. Corporations. If a Fund holds an equity
interest in any "passive foreign investment companies" ("PFICs"), which are     
generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual
gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents   
and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in    
investments producing such passive income, the Fund could be subject to U.S.    
federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain         
distributions with respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or 
gain is timely distributed to its shareholders. A Fund will not be able to pass 
through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes. A Fund may  
be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax             
consequences. In this case, the Fund would recognize as ordinary income any     
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in 
such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income.  
Under this election, the Fund might be required to recognize in a year income in
excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of    
PFIC stock during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to   
the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the
4% excise tax. Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as qualified dividend
income.

       Non-U.S. Investors. If you are a non-U.S. investor (i.e., an investor
other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate
or trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax       
treaties, distributions from a Fund will be characterized as dividends for      
federal income tax purposes (other than dividends which the Fund designates as  
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including     
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below. However,      
distributions received by a non-U.S. investor from a Fund that are properly     
designated by the Fund as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.     
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the Fund makes 
certain elections and certain other conditions are met. In the case of dividends
with respect to taxable years of a Fund beginning prior to 2010, distributions  
from the Fund that are properly designated by the Fund as an interest-related   
dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the Fund or as a   
short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net short-term capital 
gain income received by the Fund may not be subject to U.S. federal income      
taxes, including withholding taxes when received by certain non-U.S. investors, 
provided that the Fund makes certain elections and certain other conditions are 
met. In addition, distributions after December 31, 2012 may be subject to a U.S.
withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-U.S.     
financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the U.S.    
Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and (ii) certain other     
non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications and information    
about the entity's U.S. owners.

     Destra Investments LLC, 2 S. 406 Seneca Drive, Wheaton, IL 60189, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Destra Capital Management LLC, serves as the         
principal underwriter of the shares of the Funds pursuant to a "best efforts"   
arrangement as provided by a distribution agreement with the Trust (the         
"Distribution Agreement"). Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Trust    
appointed Destra Investments LLC to be its agent for the distribution of the    
Fund's shares on a continuous offering basis. The cash-compensation rate at     
which Destra Investments LLC' registered representatives are paid for sales of  
institutional products may differ based on a type of fund or a specific trust.  
The receipt of (or prospect of receiving) compensation described above may      
provide an incentive for a registered representative to favor sales of funds, or
certain share classes of a fund, for which they receive a higher compensation   
rate. You should consider these arrangements when evaluating any recommendations
of your registered representative.                                              

DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS 

      The Destra Funds have adopted a portfolio holdings disclosure policy
which governs the dissemination of a Fund's portfolio holdings. In accordance   
with this policy, the Funds may                                                 

25

P-->N-1A80th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 80th
provide portfolio holdings information to third parties no earlier than the time
a report is filed with the SEC that is required to contain such information or  
one day after the information is posted on the Fund's publicly accessible       
website, destracapital.com. The Funds generally make available complete         
portfolio holdings information on the Funds' website following the end of each  
month with an approximately one-month lag. Additionally, the Fund publishes on  
the website a list of its top ten holdings as of the end of each month,         
approximately two to five business days after the end of the month for which the
information is current. This information will remain available on the website at
least until the Funds file with the SEC their Forms N-CSR or Forms N-Q for the  
period that includes the date as of which the website information is current.   

     Additionally, the Funds may disclose portfolio holdings information
that has not been included in a filing with the SEC or posted on the Funds'     
website (i.e., non-public portfolio holdings information) only if there is a    
legitimate business purpose for doing so and if the recipient is required,      
either by explicit agreement or by virtue of the recipient's duties to the Funds
as an agent or service provider, to maintain the confidentiality of the         
information and to not use the information in an improper manner (e.g., personal
trading). In this connection, the Funds may disclose on an ongoing basis        
non-public portfolio holdings information in the normal course of its investment
and administrative operations to various service providers, including its       
investment adviser and subadviser, independent registered public accounting     
firm, custodian, financial printer (Financial Graphic Service), proxy voting    
service(s), and to the legal counsel for the Funds' independent trustees        
(Chapman and Cutler LLP). Also, a Fund's investment adviser may transmit to     
Vestek Systems, Inc. daily non-public portfolio holdings information on a       
next-day basis to enable the investment adviser to perform portfolio attribution
analysis using Vestek's systems and software programs. Vestek is also provided  
with non-public portfolio holdings information on a monthly basis approximately 
2-3 business days after the end of each month so that Vestek may calculate and  
provide certain statistical information (but not the non-public holdings        
information itself) to its clients (including retirement plan sponsors or their 
consultants). The Funds' investment adviser and sub-adviser may also provide    
certain portfolio holdings information to broker-dealers from time to time in   
connection with the purchase or sale of securities or requests for price        
quotations or bids on one or more securities. In providing this information,    
reasonable precautions are taken in an effort to avoid potential misuse of the  
disclosed information, including limitations on the scope of the portfolio      
holdings information disclosed, when appropriate.                               

    Non-public portfolio holdings information may be provided to other
persons if approved by a Fund's Trustee upon a determination that there is a    
legitimate business purpose for doing so, the disclosure is consistent with the 
interests of the Fund, and the recipient is obligated to maintain the           
confidentiality of the information and not misuse it.                           

Compliance officers of a Fund and its investment adviser and  
sub-adviser periodically monitor overall compliance with the policy to ascertain
whether portfolio holdings information is disclosed in a manner that is         
consistent with the Fund's policy. Reports are made to a Fund's Board of        
Trustees on an annual basis.

      There is no assurance that the Funds' policies on portfolio holdings
information will protect a Fund from the potential misuse of portfolio holdings 
information by individuals or firms in possession of such information.

GENERAL TRUST INFORMATION 

The Funds are a series of the Trust. The Trust is an open-end 
management investment company under the 1940 Act. The Trust was organized as a  
Massachusetts business trust on May 25, 2010. The Board of Trustees of          
the Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares in one or more   
series, which may be divided into classes of shares. Currently, there are 3     
series authorized and outstanding, each of which may be generally divided into  
different classes of shares designated as Class A shares, Class C shares, Class 
P shares and Class I shares. Each class of shares represents an interest in the 
same portfolio of investments of a Fund. Each class of shares has equal rights  
as to voting, redemption, dividends and liquidation, except that each bears     
different class expenses, including different distribution and service fees, and
each has exclusive voting rights with respect to any distribution or service    
plan applicable to its shares. There are no conversion, preemptive or other     
subscription rights. The Board of Trustees of the Trust has the right to        
establish additional series and classes of shares in the future, to change those
series or classes and to determine the preferences, voting powers, rights and   
privileges thereof.                                                             

       The Trust is not required and does not intend to hold annual meetings
of shareholders. Shareholders owning more than 10% of the outstanding shares of 
a Fund have the right to call a special meeting to remove trustees or for any   
other purpose.                                                                  

      Under Massachusetts law applicable to Massachusetts business trusts,
shareholders of such a trust may, under certain circumstances, be held          
personally liable as partners for its obligations. However, the Declaration of  
Trust of the Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for  
acts or obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of this disclaimer be 
given in each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by   
the Trust or the trustees. The Trust's Declaration of Trust further provides for
indemnification out of the assets and property of the Trust for all losses and  
expenses of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the   
Trust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of   
shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which both inadequate      
insurance existed and

the Trust or a Fund itself was unable to meet its obligations. The Trust        
believes the likelihood of the occurrence of these circumstances is remote.

ITEM 30. INDEMNIFICATION 

Section 9.5 of the Registrant's Declaration of Trust provides as follows:       

     Subject to the exceptions and limitations contained in this Section
9.5, every person who is, or has been, a Trustee, officer, or employee of the   
Trust, including persons who serve at the request of the Trust as directors,    
trustees, officers, employees or agents of another organization in which the    
Trust has an interest as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise (hereinafter      
referred to as a "Covered Person"), shall be indemnified by the Trust to the    
fullest extent permitted by law against liability and against all expenses      
reasonably incurred or paid by him or in connection with any claim, action, suit
or proceeding in which he becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of 
his being or having been such a Trustee, director, officer, employee or agent   
and against amounts paid or incurred by him in settlement thereof.              

P-->N-1A84th Page of 88TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 84th
       No indemnification shall be provided hereunder to a Covered Person to
the extent such indemnification is prohibited by applicable federal law.        

         The rights of indemnification herein provided may be insured against by
policies maintained by the Trust, shall be severable, shall not affect any other
rights to which any Covered Person may now or hereafter be entitled, shall      
continue as to a person who has ceased to be such a Covered Person and shall    
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a       
person.                                                                         

Subject to applicable federal law, expenses of preparation and
presentation of a defense to any claim, action, suit or proceeding subject to a 
claim for indemnification under this Section 9.5 shall be advanced by the Trust 
prior to final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on      
behalf of the recipient to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that
he is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 9.5.                   

   To the extent that any determination is required to be made as to
whether a Covered Person engaged in conduct for which indemnification is not    
provided as described herein, or as to whether there is reason to believe that a
Covered Person ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification, the Person 
or Persons making the determination shall afford the Covered Person a rebuttable
presumption that the Covered Person has not engaged in such conduct and that    
there is reason to believe that the Covered Person ultimately will be found     
entitled to indemnification.                                                    

     As used in this Section 9.5, the words "claim," "action," "suit" or
"proceeding" shall apply to all claims, demands, actions, suits, investigations,
regulatory inquiries, proceedings or any other occurrence of a similar nature,  
whether actual or threatened and whether civil, criminal, administrative or     
other, including appeals, and the words "liability" and "expenses" shall include
without limitation, attorneys' fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in          
settlement, fines, penalties and other liabilities.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
