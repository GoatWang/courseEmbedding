        North Attleboro mobile home park to be replaced by new shopping center

NORTH ATTLEBORO — One of the town’s oldest mobile home parks will soon be home to new tenants.Plans for a new shopping center are en route for the 22-acre plot that once stood home to Whispering Pines Mobile Home Park across from Emerald Square mall on Route 1.The shopping complex, called Shops at Emerald on town paperwork, will include an anchor store and a few restaurants Town Planner Nancy Runkle said.





A mock-up by developer Carpionato Group on the company’s website shows six buildings including LA Fitness and Jared Jewelers as potential retailers. The lot is estimated to carry about 350 parking spaces.Kelly Coates, senior vice president of development with the company, said four buildings will be retail space and two buildings are reserved for offices. He said the development is about 50 percent pre-leased but he could not confirm any tenants as of yet.Coates said the project still needs to undergo a site plan review and other permits with the town, but the company hopes to begin construction late this summer with a fall 2018 open date.Coates said the plaza will not be called Shops at Emerald, although a new name was not yet available.The project is independent of Emerald Square mall.The Rhode Island-based developer has been busy with properties down Route 1 over the last few years, most recently with the new Shoppes at Mayfaire plaza on the corner of May Street and Route 1 in Attleboro and a South Attleboro plaza dubbed Shops on Washington at the intersection of routes 123, 1 and 1A.The former owners of Whispering Pines, Thomas and Patricia Gaudette, sold the lot to Shops at Emerald LLC for a little over $2 million in July 2015.





State law requires a two-year notice of sale to residents in a mobile home community before they are expelled from the property.Over the past few months, tenants have slowly been moving out and shuttering their homes.Runkle said the old mobile homes will be donated to homeless veterans or used by firefighters from North Attleboro and surrounding communities for safety training. One lucky home will also be used on an upcoming movie set.There is a zoning board of appeals hearing on the project at 6:30 p.m., June 20 at Town Hall.
