                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                
                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                Standards of BBB Accreditation


                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

ENERGY PLUS TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLY 


	We appreciate your business. This document is a contract between us, Energy Plus, and you that allows us to switch your electricity and natural gas account(s) to our service. It describes the nature of our service with you and provides important information for you to be aware of. We will begin supplying your electricity and natural gas under this contract, but your utility will continue to be responsible for delivering your electricity and natural gas sending you a bill for both of our services.




				Summary of Important Information





Length of Your Commitment

				Month-to-Month 



Price for Your Electricity

				You'll receive a promotional electric supply price for your first three bills and your price will be variable after that.



Price for Your Natural Gas

				You'll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility's natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes.



Applicable Fees

				None



Your Right to Rescind

				New customers have 7 calendar days to rescind this contract. Existing customers entering into a new contract have 3 business days to rescind. This is called your “Right to Rescind” period, which means you will not start service with us until after this period. 



Your Right to Cancel

				Once service has started, you may cancel by contacting us. It may take one or two billing cycles before the cancellation is finalized, depending on your utility’s timeframes. 





A. Important Information 



Length of Your Commitment: Month-to-Month. We will begin providing service to you after your utility processes our request to switch your service. The switch will not occur before the expiration of your “Right to Rescind” period. Our service will continue until either of us cancels the contract.         

Price: You will receive a promotional price for your first three billing cycles with us.

For Your Electricity: The promotional electric supply price you will receive during your first three billing cycles with us will be listed in your Welcome Confirmation. For your reference, our prices include generation and transmission charges and Sales and Use Tax (SUT), but they do not include any utility distribution charges or other utility fee or charge. If you enrolled in a plan with a percentage of green power, your price includes the cost for us to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates. 

After the promotional period, your prices with us will be variable.

For Your Natural Gas: You'll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility's natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. The promotional natural gas supply price works differently than the promotional electric supply price because it may change for each of your first three billing cycles in order to stay 5% lower than your utility's natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. If you have a residential account, any natural gas supply price comparisons we make are based on your utility's natural gas supply rate for PSE&G's RSG rate class and NJNG's RS rate class. If you have a commercial account, any natural gas supply price comparisons we make are based on your utility's natural gas supply rate for PSE&G's GSG/LVG rate class and NJNG's GSS rate class. For your reference, our prices include natural gas supply and transportation charges and Sales and Use Tax (SUT), but they do not include any utility distribution charges or other utility fee or charge.
After the promotional period, your prices with us will be variable. 

	We will determine the variable supply price in our discretion based on many different factors, which may include competitive prices, industry charges we are responsible for, applicable state and local taxes, profit margins, or other business conditions. Our current and historical prices are not an indicator of our future prices and we do not guarantee any savings. Our prices may be higher than your utility’s supply rate. No matter what, we will not increase your variable price in any given month by more than 30% from the prior month’s supply price.

Applicable Fees: None. If you are currently in a contract with another electricity and natural gas supplier, the request to switch you to our service will automatically cancel your service with the other electricity and natural gas supplier. You are responsible for any penalties the other electricity and natural gas supplier may charge.        

Right to Rescind: You have the “Right to Rescind” this contract for a limited time, which means you can cancel your request to switch your electricity and natural gas service and never start service with us. After switching your electricity and natural gas service to us, you will receive a confirmation notice from your utility to confirm your choice for us to be your electricity and natural gas supplier. If you are a new customer, you can rescind for up to seven calendar days from the date of that notice from your utility by calling your utility at the contact information listed below. If you are a current customer entering into a new contract with us, you have the right to rescind without penalty within three business days of receipt of this contract by calling us at 1-877-866-9193. This contract is not binding until your “Right to Rescind” period has ended with no action on your part to rescind the contract.        

Your Right to Cancel: We will not charge you for starting or stopping service. You may cancel this contract without having to pay any cancellation fee by calling us at our contact information listed below. We will request that the utility cancel your service with us, but the utility controls the effective date of your cancellation. The effective date is usually the next date that your meter is read after the utility has processed our request to cancel your service with us. If you do cancel this contract, you may forfeit some of the rewards that we describe in your Welcome Confirmation, and you will be responsible for unpaid balances as of the cancellation date. This contract may also be cancelled without any penalties if you should pass away or in the event that you move, relocate, or have a disability that prevents you from paying for service with forty-eight (48) hours’ notice.   

Our Right to Cancel: We have the right to cancel this contract for any reason as long as we give you thirty days' written notice, but if we are canceling the contract due to your conduct or your breach of this contract, you will have an opportunity to fix this condition within the thirty days. Your utility will control the effective date of our cancellation request, but this is usually the next date that your meter is read. If your utility terminates your service, this contract will be automatically cancelled.    

Your Authorization to Release Your Information: This contract provides authorization for your utility to release all information regarding your electricity and natural gas account to us and for us to contact you about our other products and services or share information about your account with any designated rewards partner or with any third-party vendor we use to provide services and rewards to you. We reserve the right to share information with our affiliates, to the extent permitted by law.       

Electronic Communication: If you provide us with your Email address, you are consenting to this contract and other forms of communication being provided to you in electronic form and you must provide us with any update to your valid Email address should it change. You are required to notify us of any change in Email address and/or any withdrawal of consent for the electronic transmission of contracts or other customer information. If you enroll electronically, please note that our website and application is best viewed in Internet Explorer 8.0 or higher.      

Billing: Your local utility is responsible for sending you a bill that includes the charges for our service and charges for the utility’s service. The bill that the utility sends should include a separate line item for our service. Under this contract, you agree to pay your utility directly for our service, but if you fail to make a payment for 120 days, we may bill you separately for any unpaid charges from us. In that event, you agree to pay the costs we incur to collect any amounts owed to us, which could include reasonable attorneys’ fees.

	You also agree to review your bills in a timely manner, and if there are any inaccuracies with the portion of the bill for our services, you agree to notify us within ninety days after the date of the bill. If we do not hear from you, you are agreeing that the billed amounts are correct and you are waiving any right to dispute the billed amounts to the extent permitted by law.    

Taxes: Any applicable tax charges are included on the one bill you will receive from your utility. If you are exempt from any taxes, you are responsible for requesting an exemption by filing all required documentation with us and/or your utility.    

Contract Details: Energy Plus Holdings LLC supplies your electricity and our subsidiary, Energy Plus Natural Gas LLC supplies your natural gas. We use “Energy Plus”, “we”, “us”, or “our” to refer to both of us for the purposes of this contract. We use “you” or “your” to refer to you, the customer.

	This contract is for the sale and purchase of all of your electricity and natural gas for the residential account(s) listed in your Welcome Confirmation (letter or email). By entering into this contract, you are authorizing us to take the steps necessary to switch your electricity and natural gas supply service to us, and you agree to appoint us as your agent to acquire the necessary information to meet your electricity and natural gas needs as required by your “utility”, which we use to refer to your local distribution company. Your utility is responsible for the delivery of electricity and natural gas to you and we are not. This contract and the Welcome Confirmation (letter or email) you received create your entire contract with us and replace any prior oral or written statements or representations.     

	Contract Changes: We can only change a material term of this contract with your consent, and we will obtain your approval before making any material change. We will not change or alter the waiver of jury trial provision under any circumstances, and any changes to this contract must be made in writing.    

Customer Complaints: If you have questions about our prices or our service, you should call us at the contact information listed below. If you are not satisfied with the response from our Customer Care representative, you may ask that your questions be referred to one of our supervisors, who will respond promptly. If you remain unsatisfied with our attempts to resolve the issue, you may seek assistance from the NJ BPU or request information from the NJ BPU regarding your consumer protection rights. The NJ BPU's contact information is listed below.

Assignment: We may sell, transfer, pledge or assign the accounts, revenues or proceeds associated with this contract in connection with any financial contract, and we may assign the rights and obligations under this contract to another energy supplier consistent with applicable law. You may not assign this contract.    

No Reliance: You acknowledge that (1) you are not relying on any advice, statements, recommendations or representations of ours other than the written representations in this contract; (2) that you consulted with your own advisors to the extent you deemed necessary; and (3) that you understand the risks of entering into this contract, including the risk that our prices may be higher than your utility’s rates. You acknowledge that you are capable and willing to assume those risks (whether financial, economic or otherwise) and that you have made your own decision to enter into this contract.    

Force Majeure: We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide electricity and natural gas supply to you pursuant to this contract, but we do not guarantee a continuous supply of electricity and natural gas. Certain Force Majeure events outside of our control may cause interruptions in service. If a Force Majeure event prevents us from performing any of our obligations in any way, our performance shall be excused for the duration of such event, and we will not be liable for damages associated with any delay or failure to perform as a result. "Force Majeure" includes, without limitation, acts outside of our control, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of vandalism, terrorist acts, natural disasters, explosions, fires, or similarly cataclysmic occurrence, failure, shortage or unavailability of generating units or transmission facilities, nonperformance by your local utility, or any change in law or any other action by a governmental authority that materially impairs our ability to perform our obligations under this contract. We will give you reasonably prompt notice of any Force Majeure occurrence.     

Severability: Each provision of this contract is made subject to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any are held to be unenforceable or invalid by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, we will negotiate an equitable adjustment to or an amendment of the affected provisions with you with a view toward effecting the purpose of this contract. In this case, the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.    

LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND DAMAGES: THE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS PROVIDED UNDER THIS CONTRACT WILL MEET THE QUALITY STANDARDS OF YOUR UTILITY. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY US. WE HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS NOR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS OR DAMGAGE RESULTING FROM SUCH INTERRUPTIONS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY NEW JERSEY LAW, LIABILITIES NOT EXCUSED BY REASON OF FORCE MAJEURE OR OTHERWISE SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES. WE WILL BEAR NO LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMGAGES OR LOST PROFITS. THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES ARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES OF THE HARM OR LOSS, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE.

BY ENTERING INTO THIS CONTRACT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO SEEK REMEDIES IN COURT, OTHER THAN IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, AND THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

AAA MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IN THE EVENT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATION IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. JUDGMENT ON THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD CAN BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THIS AGREEMENT EVIDENCES A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE, AND THUS THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS PROVISION.

ENERGY PLUS TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLY 
We appreciate your business. This document is a contract between us, Energy Plus, and you that allows us to switch your electricity and natural gas account(s) to our service. It describes the nature of our service with you and provides important information for you to be aware of. We will begin supplying your electricity and natural gas under this contract, but your utility will continue to be responsible for delivering your electricity and natural gas sending you a bill for both of our services.



Summary of Important Information




Length of Your Commitment
Month-to-Month


Price for Your Electricity
You'll receive a promotional electricity supply price for your first three bills and your price will be variable after that.


Price for Your Natural Gas
You’ll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility’s natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. 


Applicable Fees
None.


Your Right to Rescind
You have 7 calendar days to rescind this contract. This is called your “Right to Rescind” period, which means you will not start service with us until after this period. 


Your Right to Cancel
Once service has started, you may cancel by contacting us. It may take one or two billing cycles before the cancellation is finalized, depending on your utility’s timeframes.  




A. Important Information 


Length of Your Commitment: Month-to-Month. We will begin providing service to you at the point of “Enrollment Acceptance”, which is after your utility processes our request to switch your service. The switch will not occur before the expiration of your “Right to Rescind” period. Typically, we send our request to switch your service to the utility within three (3) business days following your application with us; however, we may hold our request for the purpose of resolving questions related to enrollment data or as needed for us to complete set up with processing vendors or your utility, or if you request a future start date. Our service will continue until either of us cancels the contract.       

Price: You will receive a promotional price for your first three billing cycles with us.

For Your Electricity: The promotional electricity supply price you will receive during your first three billing cycles with us will be stated in your Welcome Confirmation. For your reference, our prices include generation and transmission charges, but they do not include any utility delivery charges or other utility fee or charge for which you will also be billed. If you enrolled in a plan with a percentage of green power, your price includes the cost for us to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates. Environmental disclosure information is provided at our website and is incorporated by reference into this contract. The specific web address is: www.energypluscompany.com/ohenvironment. We will make our required annual projection and quarterly comparisons of actual to projected data electronically on our website and we will also provide the information via mail upon request. 

For Your Natural Gas: You’ll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility’s natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. The promotional natural gas supply price works differently than the promotional electricity supply price because it may change for each of your first three billing cycles in order to stay 5% lower than your utility’s natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. For your reference, our prices include natural gas supply and transportation charges, but they do not include any utility distribution charges or other utility fee or charge.

After the promotional period, your prices with us will be variable. Any change may occur no more frequently than monthly. We will determine the variable supply price in our discretion based on many different factors, which may include competitive prices, industry charges we are responsible for, applicable state and local taxes, profit margins, or other business conditions. Our current and historical prices are not an indicator of our future prices and we do not guarantee any savings. Our prices may be higher than your utility’s supply rate. No matter what, we will not increase your variable price in any given month by more than 30% from the prior month’s supply price. 

Applicable Fees: None. If you are currently in a contract with another electricity and natural gas supplier, the request to switch you to our service will automatically cancel your service with the other electricity and natural gas supplier. You are responsible for any penalties the other electricity and natural gas supplier may charge.       

Right to Rescind: You have the “Right to Rescind” this contract for seven (7) calendar days, which means you can cancel your request to switch your electricity and natural gas service and never start service with us. You will receive a confirmation notice from your utililty company, and you will have until midnight of the seventh calendar day after receipt of the confirmation notice to rescind this contract by contacting us at the telephone number or email address listed below. For current customers, you will have until midnight of the third business day after receipt of the Welcome Confirmation to rescind this contract by contacting us at the telephone number or email address listed below. This contract is not binding until your “Right to Rescind” period has ended with no action on your part to rescind the contract.     

Your Right to Cancel: You may cancel this contract by calling us at our contact information listed below. We will request that the utility cancel your service with us, but the utility controls the effective date of your cancellation. The effective date is usually the next date that your meter is read after the utility has processed our request to cancel your service with us. The account(s) you cancel with us will be returned to your utility unless you enrolled for service with another electric supplier for energy supply services. It may take up to two (2) billing cycles for your account(s) to be returned to your utility or switched to another supplier. Switching fees may apply under your utility’s tariff, but we will not separately charge a switching fee. If you voluntarily return to your utility supply service, you may not be served under the same rates or terms and conditions that apply to other customers served by your utility. If you do cancel this contract, you may forfeit some of the rewards that we describe in your Welcome Confirmation, and you will be responsible for unpaid balances as of the cancellation date. 

If you are moving, please contact us as well as your utility to ensure a smooth transition of your service. You have the right to cancel this contract without penalty if you relocate outside your current utility’s service territory or if you relocate within your current utility’s service territory, but your current utility does not allow portability of the contract. This contract will be automatically cancelled, without penalty, if the requested service location is not served by the utility, if you move outside the utility service area or to an area not serviced by us; or if we return you to your utility, subject to the provisions described in this contract. 

Our Right to Cancel: We have the right to cancel this contract for any reason as long as we give you thirty days' written notice. We have the right to cancel the contract on at least fourteen days written notice if you fail to pay the utility bill or fail to meet any agreed-upon payment arrangements. Your utility will control the effective date of our cancellation request, but this is usually the next date that your meter is read. If your utility terminates your service, this contract will be automatically cancelled.

Your contract will terminate if any of the following occurs: (1) the requested service location is not served by your local utility; (2) you move outside of your utility service area or to an area we do not service; or (3) we return your service to your local utility.   

Your Authorization to Release Your Information: This contract provides authorization for your utility to release all information regarding your electricity and natural gas account to us and for us to contact you about our other products and services or share information about your account with any designated rewards partner or with any third-party vendor we use to provide services and rewards to you. We reserve the right to share information with our affiliates to the extent permitted by law. We will not disclose your social security number and/or account number(s) without your consent except for our own collections and credit reporting, participation in programs funded by the universal service fund, or if necessary to assign your contract to another provider.      

Electronic Communication: If you provide us with your Email address, you are consenting to this contract and other forms of communication being provided to you in electronic form and you must provide us with any update to your valid Email address should it change. You are required to notify us of any change in Email address and/or any withdrawal of consent for the electronic transmission of contracts or other customer information. If you enroll electronically, please note that our website and application is best viewed in Internet Explorer 8.0 or higher.    

Billing: Your local utility is responsible for sending you a bill that includes the charges for our service and charges for the utility’s service. Failure to make full payment may be grounds for disconnection from your utility as it describes in its tariffs. We do not offer budget billing, but your utility may offer you budget billing or other payment plans.

You also agree to review your bills in a timely manner, and if there are any inaccuracies with the portion of the bill for our services, you agree to notify us within ninety days after the date of the bill. If we do not hear from you, you are agreeing that the billed amounts are correct and you are waiving any right to dispute the billed amounts to the extent permitted by law. You have the right to request up to twenty-four (24) months of payment history without charge from us, twice within a twelve month period.  

Taxes: Any applicable tax charges are included on the one bill you will receive from your utility. If you are exempt from any taxes, you are responsible for requesting an exemption by filing all required documentation as filed with the Ohio Department of Taxation with us and/or your utility.   

Contract Details: Energy Plus Holdings LLC supplies your electricity and our subsidiary, Energy Plus Natural Gas LLC supplies your natural gas. We use “Energy Plus”, “we”, “us”, or “our” to refer to both of us for the purposes of this contract. We use “you” or “your” to refer to you, the customer.

This contract is for the sale and purchase of all of your electricity and natural gas for the residential account(s) listed in your Welcome Confirmation (letter or email). By entering into this contract, you are authorizing us to take the steps necessary to switch your electricity and natural gas supply service to us, and you agree to appoint us as your agent to acquire the necessary information to meet your electricity and natural gas needs as required by your “utility”, which we use to refer to your local distribution company. Your utility is responsible for the delivery of electricity and natural gas to you and we are not. This contract and the Welcome Confirmation (letter or email) you received create your entire contract with us and replace any prior oral or written statements or representations.      

Contract Changes: If we propose a material change to the terms of this contract, we will notify you in advance and explain your options going forward.. We will not change or alter the waiver of jury trial provision under any circumstances, and any changes to this contract must be made in writing.

Your Energy Plus Holdings LLC Electric Generation
												Disclosure Label
												PO Box 38815, Philadelphia, PA 19104
												1-888-766-3509    www.energypluscompany.com

See Other Side












What is this label about?
				It's about helping you compare the benefits of generation service offers of Energy Plus Holdings LLC to those of other competitive electric suppliers and to CL&P or UI.


To our customers:
				Electric generation service in Connecticut can be provided to you by licensed Suppliers, CL&P, or UI. This is a choice you can make. This Energy Plus Holdings LLC disclosure label can be used to compare prices and other items (such as generation power sources and renewable sources) to those that other Suppliers, CL&P or UI may offer you.




Important considerations in making your comparisons and choice:


						Ask the Supplier, CL&P or UI if its offer is all-inclusive or not all-inclusive, so you can make the right comparison and choice. Suppliers, CL&P and UI in Connecticut are required to disclose this information to you in their labels.

						An all-inclusive offer includes all charges and fees related to the generation portion of your electric bill included in the price of the Generation Service Charge (GSC). A not all-inclusive offer does not; thus, there are other charges and/or fees that you would be assessed in addition to the GSC.

						Check any contract or agreement you are considering from a Supplier for specifics on price, such as whether pricing is fixed or variable, the term/length of contract, and any other charges, enrollment fees, deposits or requirements for which you are responsible.



Other questions you can ask a potential supplier:


						Is the Supplier licensed by the CT DPUC?

						Ask the Supplier to estimate your electric generation costs relative to CL&P's/UI's and explain other possible benefits of switching your service. The average residential customer in CT uses 700 kWh per month. This would be a good comparison starting point. Some examples of the possible benefits are cost savings, budget certainty, risk management, product offerings and renewable energy.

						How does the Supplier's all-inclusive price compare with the current CL&P or UI GSC charge?

						Will the Supplier's price change when the CL&P or UI GSC price changes or is it fixed for the term of the contract/agreement?

						If I switch to a Supplier, will my GSC charge still be on the CL&P/UI bill or will I receive a separate bill from the supplier?

						If a Supplier issues a separate bill to me, will there be a late payment fee and, if so, what is the annual percentage charge?

						Does the Supplier offer a choice of energy sources, such as renewable energy?

						What is the Supplier's contact information if I have questions? Contact information should include the Supplier's phone number, customer service hours, mailing address and contact name.






The term of your service is month-to-month upon enrollment and is effective until cancelled by either party.

					Your all-inclusive rate is variable per kWh and is stated under "Rate" on your Welcome Confirmation.

					For Pricing Information - See "Term" and "Rate" sections in your contract.








Reminder: Your monthly electric bill also has a section for delivery service. This service is for the poles, wires, transformers and all of the other services to deliver electricity to your home or business. Delivery service charges do NOT include what you pay for your electric Generation Service in the GSC charge. You pay delivery service charges whether you buy your electricity from CL&P, UI or any other supplier.

About Power Sources 

				Your electricity is transmitted across the New England electric system, which receives electricity from power plants throughout the region to meet the requirements of all customers in New England. The "New England Power Pool System Mix" represents the percentage of power supply from each power source in the regional system. Suppliers are responsible for generating and/or purchasing electricity that is added to the electric system in an amount equal to your electricity use. To promote the development of renewable/clean sources, Connecticut, through legislation called the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), requires all Suppliers to acquire specific percentages of energy from renewable resources. CT RPS sources are defined as Class I, Class II and Class III. Class I renewable sources include solar power, fuel cells, methane gas from landfills, ocean thermal power, sustainable biomass, wave or tidal power, low emission advanced renewable energy conversion technologies, and certain run-of-river hydropower. Class II renewable sources include trash-to-energy, certain biomass facilities, and certain run-of-river hydropower facilities. Electricity generation from renewables has lower emissions and less of an impact on the environment than that produced from conventional fossil fuels. As an alternative to providing the RPS requirements a Supplier may pay an alternative compliance payment. Class III sources include CT commercial & industrial facilities using combined heat and power systems with at least 50% operating efficiency, a waste heat recovery system or electricity savings from energy efficiency measures.





Air Emissions from Power Sources
	The air emissions listed below are produced when certain fuels are used to generate electricity.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is released when coal, oil, natural gas, trash, methane and biomass are burned. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is thought to be a major contributor to global warming.
Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) is formed when fossil fuels, trash, methane and biomass are burned at high temperatures. They contribute to acid rain and ground-level ozone (or smog), and may contribute to respiratory illness. NOx also accelerates vegetative growth in lakes and coastal waters which may lead to oxygen deprivation which is destructive to fish and other aquatic life.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is formed when fuels containing sulfur are burned, primarily coal, oil and trash. Health risks associated with SO2 include asthma, respiratory illness and aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease. SO2 combines with water and oxygen in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which raises the acid level of lakes and streams, is detrimental to crops and forests and accelerates the deterioration of buildings and monuments.

Additional Information:
This label provides information on the New England regional electric system power sources and the air emissions related to electricity generation. For additional information on Supplier prices, power sources and air emissions, visit the CT PURA's Electric Supplier Info Database, www.dpuc.state.ct.us/el_aggre.nsf

ENERGY PLUS TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLY 
We appreciate your business. This document is a contract between us, Energy Plus, and you that allows us to switch your electricity and natural gas account(s) to our service. It describes the nature of our service with you and provides important information for you to be aware of. We will begin supplying your electricity and natural gas under this contract, but your utility will continue to be responsible for delivering your electricity and natural gas sending you a bill for both of our services.



Summary of Important Information




Length of Your Commitment
Month-to-Month


Price for Your Electricity
You'll receive a promotional electricity supply price for your first three bills and your price will be variable after that.


Price for Your Natural Gas
You’ll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility’s natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. 


Applicable Fees
None.


Your Right to Rescind
You have 7 calendar days to rescind this contract. This is called your “Right to Rescind” period, which means you will not start service with us until after this period. 


Your Right to Cancel
Once service has started, you may cancel by contacting us. It may take one or two billing cycles before the cancellation is finalized, depending on your utility’s timeframes.  




A. Important Information 


Length of Your Commitment: Month-to-Month. We will begin providing service to you at the point of “Enrollment Acceptance”, which is after your utility processes our request to switch your service. The switch will not occur before the expiration of your “Right to Rescind” period. Typically, we send our request to switch your service to the utility within three (3) business days following your application with us; however, we may hold our request for the purpose of resolving questions related to enrollment data or as needed for us to complete set up with processing vendors or your utility, or if you request a future start date. Our service will continue until either of us cancels the contract.       

Price: You will receive a promotional price for your first three billing cycles with us.

For Your Electricity: The promotional electricity supply price you will receive during your first three billing cycles with us will be stated in your Welcome Confirmation. For your reference, our prices include generation and transmission charges, but they do not include any utility delivery charges or other utility fee or charge for which you will also be billed. If you enrolled in a plan with a percentage of green power, your price includes the cost for us to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates. Environmental disclosure information is provided at our website and is incorporated by reference into this contract. The specific web address is: www.energypluscompany.com/ohenvironment. We will make our required annual projection and quarterly comparisons of actual to projected data electronically on our website and we will also provide the information via mail upon request. 

For Your Natural Gas: You’ll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility’s natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. The promotional natural gas supply price works differently than the promotional electricity supply price because it may change for each of your first three billing cycles in order to stay 5% lower than your utility’s natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. For your reference, our prices include natural gas supply and transportation charges, but they do not include any utility distribution charges or other utility fee or charge.

After the promotional period, your prices with us will be variable. Any change may occur no more frequently than monthly. We will determine the variable supply price in our discretion based on many different factors, which may include competitive prices, industry charges we are responsible for, applicable state and local taxes, profit margins, or other business conditions. Our current and historical prices are not an indicator of our future prices and we do not guarantee any savings. Our prices may be higher than your utility’s supply rate. No matter what, we will not increase your variable price in any given month by more than 30% from the prior month’s supply price. 

Applicable Fees: None. If you are currently in a contract with another electricity and natural gas supplier, the request to switch you to our service will automatically cancel your service with the other electricity and natural gas supplier. You are responsible for any penalties the other electricity and natural gas supplier may charge.       

Right to Rescind: You have the “Right to Rescind” this contract for seven (7) calendar days, which means you can cancel your request to switch your electricity and natural gas service and never start service with us. You will receive a confirmation notice from your utililty company, and you will have until midnight of the seventh calendar day after receipt of the confirmation notice to rescind this contract by contacting us at the telephone number or email address listed below. For current customers, you will have until midnight of the third business day after receipt of the Welcome Confirmation to rescind this contract by contacting us at the telephone number or email address listed below. This contract is not binding until your “Right to Rescind” period has ended with no action on your part to rescind the contract.     

Your Right to Cancel: You may cancel this contract by calling us at our contact information listed below. We will request that the utility cancel your service with us, but the utility controls the effective date of your cancellation. The effective date is usually the next date that your meter is read after the utility has processed our request to cancel your service with us. The account(s) you cancel with us will be returned to your utility unless you enrolled for service with another electric supplier for energy supply services. It may take up to two (2) billing cycles for your account(s) to be returned to your utility or switched to another supplier. Switching fees may apply under your utility’s tariff, but we will not separately charge a switching fee. If you voluntarily return to your utility supply service, you may not be served under the same rates or terms and conditions that apply to other customers served by your utility. If you do cancel this contract, you may forfeit some of the rewards that we describe in your Welcome Confirmation, and you will be responsible for unpaid balances as of the cancellation date. 

If you are moving, please contact us as well as your utility to ensure a smooth transition of your service. You have the right to cancel this contract without penalty if you relocate outside your current utility’s service territory or if you relocate within your current utility’s service territory, but your current utility does not allow portability of the contract. This contract will be automatically cancelled, without penalty, if the requested service location is not served by the utility, if you move outside the utility service area or to an area not serviced by us; or if we return you to your utility, subject to the provisions described in this contract. 

Our Right to Cancel: We have the right to cancel this contract for any reason as long as we give you thirty days' written notice. We have the right to cancel the contract on at least fourteen days written notice if you fail to pay the utility bill or fail to meet any agreed-upon payment arrangements. Your utility will control the effective date of our cancellation request, but this is usually the next date that your meter is read. If your utility terminates your service, this contract will be automatically cancelled.

Your contract will terminate if any of the following occurs: (1) the requested service location is not served by your local utility; (2) you move outside of your utility service area or to an area we do not service; or (3) we return your service to your local utility.   

Your Authorization to Release Your Information: This contract provides authorization for your utility to release all information regarding your electricity and natural gas account to us and for us to contact you about our other products and services or share information about your account with any designated rewards partner or with any third-party vendor we use to provide services and rewards to you. We reserve the right to share information with our affiliates to the extent permitted by law. We will not disclose your social security number and/or account number(s) without your consent except for our own collections and credit reporting, participation in programs funded by the universal service fund, or if necessary to assign your contract to another provider.      

Electronic Communication: If you provide us with your Email address, you are consenting to this contract and other forms of communication being provided to you in electronic form and you must provide us with any update to your valid Email address should it change. You are required to notify us of any change in Email address and/or any withdrawal of consent for the electronic transmission of contracts or other customer information. If you enroll electronically, please note that our website and application is best viewed in Internet Explorer 8.0 or higher.    

Billing: Your local utility is responsible for sending you a bill that includes the charges for our service and charges for the utility’s service. Failure to make full payment may be grounds for disconnection from your utility as it describes in its tariffs. We do not offer budget billing, but your utility may offer you budget billing or other payment plans.

You also agree to review your bills in a timely manner, and if there are any inaccuracies with the portion of the bill for our services, you agree to notify us within ninety days after the date of the bill. If we do not hear from you, you are agreeing that the billed amounts are correct and you are waiving any right to dispute the billed amounts to the extent permitted by law. You have the right to request up to twenty-four (24) months of payment history without charge from us, twice within a twelve month period.  

Taxes: Any applicable tax charges are included on the one bill you will receive from your utility. If you are exempt from any taxes, you are responsible for requesting an exemption by filing all required documentation as filed with the Ohio Department of Taxation with us and/or your utility.

												Disclosure Label

												1-888-766-3509    www.energypluscompany.com

See Other Side












What is this label about?
				It's about helping you compare the benefits of generation service offers of Energy Plus Holdings LLC to those of other competitive electric suppliers and to CL&P or UI.


To our customers:
				Electric generation service in Connecticut can be provided to you by licensed Suppliers, CL&P, or UI. This is a choice you can make. This Energy Plus Holdings LLC disclosure label can be used to compare prices and other items (such as generation power sources and renewable sources) to those that other Suppliers, CL&P or UI may offer you.




Important considerations in making your comparisons and choice:


						Ask the Supplier, CL&P or UI if its offer is all-inclusive or not all-inclusive, so you can make the right comparison and choice. Suppliers, CL&P and UI in Connecticut are required to disclose this information to you in their labels.

						An all-inclusive offer includes all charges and fees related to the generation portion of your electric bill included in the price of the Generation Service Charge (GSC). A not all-inclusive offer does not; thus, there are other charges and/or fees that you would be assessed in addition to the GSC.

						Check any contract or agreement you are considering from a Supplier for specifics on price, such as whether pricing is fixed or variable, the term/length of contract, and any other charges, enrollment fees, deposits or requirements for which you are responsible.



Other questions you can ask a potential supplier:


						Is the Supplier licensed by the CT DPUC?

						Ask the Supplier to estimate your electric generation costs relative to CL&P's/UI's and explain other possible benefits of switching your service. The average residential customer in CT uses 700 kWh per month. This would be a good comparison starting point. Some examples of the possible benefits are cost savings, budget certainty, risk management, product offerings and renewable energy.

						How does the Supplier's all-inclusive price compare with the current CL&P or UI GSC charge?

						Will the Supplier's price change when the CL&P or UI GSC price changes or is it fixed for the term of the contract/agreement?

						If I switch to a Supplier, will my GSC charge still be on the CL&P/UI bill or will I receive a separate bill from the supplier?

						If a Supplier issues a separate bill to me, will there be a late payment fee and, if so, what is the annual percentage charge?

						Does the Supplier offer a choice of energy sources, such as renewable energy?

						What is the Supplier's contact information if I have questions? Contact information should include the Supplier's phone number, customer service hours, mailing address and contact name.






The term of your service is month-to-month upon enrollment and is effective until cancelled by either party.

					Your all-inclusive rate is variable per kWh and is stated under "Rate" on your Welcome Confirmation.

					For Pricing Information - See "Term" and "Rate" sections in your contract.








Reminder: Your monthly electric bill also has a section for delivery service. This service is for the poles, wires, transformers and all of the other services to deliver electricity to your home or business. Delivery service charges do NOT include what you pay for your electric Generation Service in the GSC charge. You pay delivery service charges whether you buy your electricity from CL&P, UI or any other supplier.

About Power Sources 

				Your electricity is transmitted across the New England electric system, which receives electricity from power plants throughout the region to meet the requirements of all customers in New England. The "New England Power Pool System Mix" represents the percentage of power supply from each power source in the regional system. Suppliers are responsible for generating and/or purchasing electricity that is added to the electric system in an amount equal to your electricity use. To promote the development of renewable/clean sources, Connecticut, through legislation called the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), requires all Suppliers to acquire specific percentages of energy from renewable resources. CT RPS sources are defined as Class I, Class II and Class III. Class I renewable sources include solar power, fuel cells, methane gas from landfills, ocean thermal power, sustainable biomass, wave or tidal power, low emission advanced renewable energy conversion technologies, and certain run-of-river hydropower. Class II renewable sources include trash-to-energy, certain biomass facilities, and certain run-of-river hydropower facilities. Electricity generation from renewables has lower emissions and less of an impact on the environment than that produced from conventional fossil fuels. As an alternative to providing the RPS requirements a Supplier may pay an alternative compliance payment. Class III sources include CT commercial & industrial facilities using combined heat and power systems with at least 50% operating efficiency, a waste heat recovery system or electricity savings from energy efficiency measures.





Air Emissions from Power Sources
	The air emissions listed below are produced when certain fuels are used to generate electricity.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is released when coal, oil, natural gas, trash, methane and biomass are burned. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is thought to be a major contributor to global warming.
Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) is formed when fossil fuels, trash, methane and biomass are burned at high temperatures. They contribute to acid rain and ground-level ozone (or smog), and may contribute to respiratory illness. NOx also accelerates vegetative growth in lakes and coastal waters which may lead to oxygen deprivation which is destructive to fish and other aquatic life.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is formed when fuels containing sulfur are burned, primarily coal, oil and trash. Health risks associated with SO2 include asthma, respiratory illness and aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease. SO2 combines with water and oxygen in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which raises the acid level of lakes and streams, is detrimental to crops and forests and accelerates the deterioration of buildings and monuments.

Additional Information:
This label provides information on the New England regional electric system power sources and the air emissions related to electricity generation. For additional information on Supplier prices, power sources and air emissions, visit the CT PURA's Electric Supplier Info Database, www.dpuc.state.ct.us/el_aggre.nsf

In the case of an emergency or power outage, please contact your utility. UI customers call: 1-800-7CALLUI (722-5584); and CL&P customers call 1-800-286-2000.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
