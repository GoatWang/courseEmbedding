dedicated to ourcustomers
          Thank you for choosing LGI Homes. Now that you're a home owner, we want you to know that we are just as committed to you today as we were when you were a home buyer.
          






WHY BUYING MAKES CENT$
          If you've been sitting on the fence and unsure if buying a home is right for you, consider this: homeownership offers a wide variety of advantages versus renting, and homeownership is more attainable today than ever before.

LGI Homes has set the pace for excellence in affordable home building, garnering praise for an efficient business model that saves buyers money, and winning awards for the unmatched quality of its homes.
Our homes are built on-site, with thoughtfully designed floor plans that include all of the details that are important to your family: quality appliances, custom cabinetry, dual-car garages, landscaped yards, and more. This attention to customer needs, along with our consistent individualized service, has proven so popular that from our humble beginnings in markets throughout Texas, we've now been able to expand our success to the beautiful metropolises of Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Denver, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Athens, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Tampa, Florida; Lakeland, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Fort Myers, Florida; Jacksonville, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Olympia, Washington; Tacoma, Washington; Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon.
In fact, since 2003 LGI Homes has become one of the fastest growing homebuilders in the nation, driven by our commitment to our customers, and our desire to make dreams of homeownership come true. We have crafted beautiful yet affordable homes, simplified the buying process, and stood by our clients every step of the way; and in turn our homeowners' praise has garnered us awards in customer satisfaction, and pushed us to constantly better our product, our service, and our business. There are many factors that separate LGI Homes from other Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and Oregon homebuilders, but outstanding quality and customer service is what sets us apart. 
Why not browse through our communities and find the home that's right for you? We guarantee you'll find something to love.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LGI Homes has received 3.9 out of 5 stars based on 12 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Homes Crafted With A
Legacy of Quality


The Name Behind the Dream®

In 1959 our Founder, Kevork S. Hovnanian (pictured with his son, Ara), came to a new land with a dream: to build a home for his family, and for all families seeking a better life. Although we were greatly saddened by his passing in 2009, his dream inspires us every day, and his integrity and legacy continue to guide us as we come together to build homes and communities for each and every family who puts their trust in us. It is a privilege to share our story with you.

A Message
From our CEO

I'm Ara Hovnanian, CEO and Chairman of Hovnanian Enterprises®, Inc. Thank you for your interest in our new homes and communities. I am delighted you are considering K. Hovnanian® Homes to be the builder of your new home. Having grown up in the business my father started back in 1959, I spent my summers in our communities, sweeping out houses and learning about construction, land development and other fascinating aspects of the business.  I guess you could say that homebuilding is "in my blood." The strength of a home is its foundation. The strength of our Company is our people. It would be my Company's honor to build your new home for you.

Hiring a contractor in San Francisco



Who to hire?
Contractors in San Francisco are licensed by the California State License Board (CSLB), which regulates general contractors and 45 specialty classes (e.g. plumbing, electrical, etc.). When you click on a contractor to access their full profile, you should check their license type to verify that they are appropriate for your specific project.



How much should it cost?
Rates in San Francisco tend to be about 25% higher than the rest of the US. There are a lot of factors that can influence the cost for your project. We recommend using our bidding system to make sure you get a competitive quote. You can also browse our San Francisco project map to get a sense for cost in your neighborhood.



How can you protect yourself?
Hiring a contractor who holds an active license with the CSLB ensures they have several years of verified experience in their field and have passed an examination administered by the state. Licensed contractors are also subject to a criminal background check and hold an active bond to protect you in case their work is defective.

This attention to customer needs, along with our consistent individualized service, has proven so popular that from our humble beginnings in markets throughout Texas, we've now been able to expand our success to the beautiful metropolises of Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Denver, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Athens, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Tampa, Florida; Lakeland, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Fort Myers, Florida; Jacksonville, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Olympia, Washington; Tacoma, Washington; Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon.
In fact, since 2003 LGI Homes has become one of the fastest growing homebuilders in the nation, driven by our commitment to our customers, and our desire to make dreams of homeownership come true. We have crafted beautiful yet affordable homes, simplified the buying process, and stood by our clients every step of the way; and in turn our homeowners' praise has garnered us awards in customer satisfaction, and pushed us to constantly better our product, our service, and our business. There are many factors that separate LGI Homes from other Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and Oregon homebuilders, but outstanding quality and customer service is what sets us apart. 
Why not browse through our communities and find the home that's right for you? We guarantee you'll find something to love.
