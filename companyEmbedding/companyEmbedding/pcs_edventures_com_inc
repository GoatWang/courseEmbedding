Description

Be sure to call our sales department at (800) 429-3110 for more information and visit http://rubiq.edventures.com to see the support site for Discover Drones!

Drones capture stunning aerial photography, save lives in modern day search and rescue missions, collect snot samples from whales for scientific research, inspect vast agricultural landscapes, survey crocodile-infested waters, thrill spectators in FPV racing, bring medical supplies to war-torn areas and deliver pizzas in New Zealand. The world has fallen in love with them, and we’re sure your students will too.
In Discover Drones, your learning environment will experience first-hand the technology that’s been sweeping over the world. Starting with lessons in engineering and technology, students begin by building RubiQ, their modular, open-source training drone! After learning the safety regulations and procedures surrounding unmanned aerial vehicles, they’ll then start with the basics of flight, first becoming comfortable on a training simulator before moving to line-of-sight piloting. After mastering RubiQ’s controls, it’s time for students to don their First-Person View (FPV) goggles, experiencing first-hand what STEM at 75 MPH is like! 
Discover Drones utilizes the PCS Edventures cutting-edge curriculum, LABCards. The LABCard approach is intended to provide a tool that enables a more student-directed experience. Educators are empowered to provide more facilitation, coaching and mentoring as students work independently and in their own fashion. To keep interest piqued, each card includes a mix of different activities for you to flow between. From whole group discussions and time for teams to work together on their drone to individual quizzes and flight simulator practice, every LABCard is unique, engaging and downright fun! 
Coupled with hands-on, experiential learning, Discover Drones also utilizes the online educational app, Droneology, a fast-paced, interactive online course that prepares pilots of all skill levels for safe and responsible drone entertainment. Droneology covers topics of safety, laws and regulations, flight basics and the many uses of drones! This digital course is optimized for use on mobile devices, allowing easy access from phones, tablets or computers, anytime, anywhere. 
From learning to piece RubiQ together to making death-defying aerial maneuvers, Discover Drones is the trailblazing educational tool your learning environment needs. Preparing students for the future of UAV’s and careers that haven’t even been invented, it’s time to take flight. Are you ready for high-octane education?

How to Use Your LABCards

Each LABCard includes two step-by-step projects, two challenges, and one design project. Each project introduces new programming skills by guiding students through step-by-step activities. Two engaging challenges give students the opportunity to apply this knowledge before testing their understanding in a design project. Key terms are listed at the end of each card for reference. Along the bottom are three questions to check for understanding. Use them in discussion, written reflection, or informal conversation to probe and deepen students’ understanding. At the end of every level, a final end design project challenges students to synthesize their learning with creativity and critical thinking.
Why We LOVE Them!
The LABCard approach is intended to provide educators with a tool that enables a student-directed experience.  Educators are empowered to provide facilitation, coaching and mentoring as students work independently, in their own fashion. Almost all learning environments including after-school programs, clubs and a wide variety of classroom models, can be supported using the LABCard curriculum.
Each LABCard is assigned a point value for quick and easy assessment of progress through each level and to provide students with immediate recognition of their accomplishments.  Students earn 5 points for each card they successfully complete.  Each level includes four 5-point cards and culminates with a 5-point end design project, for a total of 25 points per level.  By completing all four levels, students can earn up to 100 points!
Technical Requirements
Technical Requirements:

One device per kit with Windows. OS X, iOS, or Android operating system.  Cortex is currently not compatible with Google Chromebooks.
All tablets require Internet connection to enable wireless communication via Bluetooth.
Note: Brown (level) Robotics II explores Cortex features for programming with virtual sensors.  Some of these features can be previewed on a laptop or desktop bot not all are compatible.  Because of this it is necessary to have tablet to fully complete that level. Students working on desktops or tablets can preview the virtual features and then move onto the next level.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
