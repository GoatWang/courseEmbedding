REQUEST A DONATION
Toys“R”Us, Inc. and the Toys“R”Us Children’s Fund together focus their charitable giving on national organizations to better centralize our philanthropic efforts. In turn, these national partners allow us to help countless local charities in the communities we serve.
 
Please carefully review the guidelines below prior to submitting a donation request.
If your group is similar in focus to any of our current charitable partners (click here to learn more) please direct your requests to that national charity. All of our support for these particular causes will be centralized with these partners, and we would respectfully decline support to a local organization that overlaps efforts with a national partner.
 
In addition, please note the following restrictions:

We will not support programs that do not focus their efforts on children’s issues.
We will not offer grants to individuals or groups for religious purposes.
We will not support capital expenditures, political or partisan programs, national ceremonies, memorials, conferences, fundraising dinners or lunches, testimonials or similar events.
We will not support organizations that discriminate on the basis of race, gender, gender identity, religion or sexual orientation.
