                                    Omega Advisors, Inc. was founded in 1991 by Leon G. Cooperman, and is registered as an investment advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. After 25 years of service, Leon Cooperman retired in 1991 from his positions as general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in order to organize Omega. For nine consecutive years while at Goldman Sachs, Lee was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in Institutional Investor Magazine’s “All-America Research Team” survey. In 1999, Steve Einhorn joined Lee at Omega as Vice Chairman. Steve, who spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs, most recently as partner-in-charge of Global Investment Research and co-chairman of the firm’s Investment Policy Committee, was a member of Institutional Investor’s “All-America Research Team” for 16 consecutive years. 
                                

                                    Omega has approximately $3.6 billion under management (as of June 30, 2017). With a significant amount of personal general partner capital invested in the Omega funds, we (to quote Warren E. Buffett) eat our own cooking; our interests are very much aligned with that of our investors.

Omega Advisors, Inc. Key Developments

Cooperman, Omega Settle SEC Insider Trading Charges for USD 4.95 Million
May 18 17
Leon Cooperman and his firm Omega Advisors Inc. agreed on to pay USD 4.95 million to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading lawsuit against them. The accord resolves charges that Cooperman and Omega reaped about USD 4.09 million of profit in 2010 by trading in Atlas Pipeline Partners LP, a longstanding holding, based on confidential tips that Cooperman received from an Atlas executive about a planned asset sale. Cooperman and Omega did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which includes USD 2.76 million of fines and a requirement that an independent consultant monitor their trading activity for five years. Court approval is required. Neither defendant was subjected to industry bans, which often accompany SEC settlements. Omega did not respond to several requests for comment. The settlement with Cooperman, 74, resolves one of the highest-profile U.S. insider trading cases, which have cast shadows over well-known hedge fund managers like Galleon Group's Raj Rajaratnam and SAC Capital Advisors' Steven A. Cohen. Omega has also suffered, with assets under management falling to about USD 3.6 billion as of March 31 from about USD 5.4 billion when the SEC sued in September. On March 20, U.S. District Judge Juan Sanchez in Philadelphia ruled that the SEC could pursue claims that Cooperman "misappropriated" information despite the apparent absence of a prior agreement by him not to trade. Cooperman's lawyers had been preparing an appeal, faulting the SEC's "aggressive and untested" theory that their client's post-disclosure agreement, an oral promise, to keep information confidential could justify insider trading charges. Thursday's settlement ends that process, and avoids a trial that had been scheduled for Nov. 6. Cooperman is worth USD 3 billion.


SEC Charges Omega Advisors, Inc. for Short Selling Violations in Advance Stock Offerings
Oct 14 15
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced enforcement actions against Omega Advisors, Inc. The firm agreed to pay disgorgement of $68,340, prejudgment interest of $686.58, and a penalty of $65,000.  Intended  to  preserve the  independent pricing  mechanisms of  the securities  markets and  prevent stock price manipulation, Rule 105 prohibits firms  from participating in public stock  offerings after selling short  those same stocks. Through  its Rule 105 Initiative,  which was first announced  in 2013 as an effort  to address violations of the rule in an  expedited and  streamlined way,  the Division  of Enforcement  has taken  action on  every Rule  105 violation  over a de minimis  amount that has come  to its attention--promoting a  message of zero tolerance for these offenses.

What are analysts saying about Ball Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Ball Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Ball Corporation witnessed a sluggish first-quarter 2015 results due to foreign currency translation and higher metal premiums in Europe. The company remains concerned for the food and household segment throughout 2015 related to the customer shift. Ball Corporation expects metal premiums, adverse currency translation and startup costs will persist as headwinds in 2015. Moreover pricing pressure in China, weak demand in Brazil and modest pressure in the U.S. food can market will affect the company's results." (7/20/2017)
2. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We have consistently been below consensus on BLL on account of volume challenges and the associated difficulty of generating organic EBITDA growth, and we see the world no differently now than we did before." (2/6/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "While we believe shares were oversold today with the underlying story unchanged, the stock will likely be range bound until it delivers stronger results, and investors get comfortable it can hit its EBITDA targets for 2017. We remain confident in BLL's ability to deliver on its LT targets, and even with a mixed 4Q, FCF came in noticeably stronger than anticipated." (2/3/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 6 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.45)Consensus Price Target: $43.44 (2.44% upside)

Is Your Omega-3 Effective?
How To Pick An Omega-3 Supplement That Works
And Get It At A Great Price

ConsumerReview doesn’t often review health care supplements, but with all the media craze surrounding Omega-3, we decided it was time to write a no-holds-barred exclusive Omega-3 supplement review.
Since Omega-3 was popularized due to over 8,000 clinical studies, supplement manufacturers have been crawling out of the woodwork to create their ‘version’ of Omega-3, with wild claims as to its actual benefits. As each new company bursts into the market with their own ‘proprietary formula’, it becomes harder to separate fact from fiction, premium product from worthless imitation.
We decided it was time to analyze them ourselves to find out which products were sub-par, which were flat-out lying about what was even in their pills, and which, if any, might actually be worth a try.
As we rounded up all of the big brands in the industry for our Omega-3 supplement review, we could see straight off the bat which companies were only there to make a quick buck.

One thing we found was that many manufacturers exceeded the recommended 1,500mg dosage and did not have enough EPA and DHA, which will greatly affect your health improvement goals.
Secondly, we found that many manufactures were using farm raised fish, not deep sea fish. It is always better to buy a product that uses high quality, all natural ingredients, not compounds created in the lab.

It’s hard to believe, but most companies slap on a label that says ‘Omega-3’, often without even mentioning how much Omega-3 is in each pill or without actually including the amount they claim.

What Did We Research?
With hundreds of manufacturers out there, we wanted to figure out what to look for and how to overcome our concerns regarding health care products. We started the process by making a list of the main concerns we have over buying a good Omega-3 product.

It’s not going to be effective. The truth is, there are a lot of products that don’t work at all. Typically, this is because they don’t contain the right ingredients or the right proportions. A lot of interested consumers don’t realize how exact a science creating an effective supplement really is.


It’s going to be too expensive to afford. As we conducted our research, we found that a lot of companies sell Omega-3 for $100 or more! Who wants to risk that kind of money on what could just be snake oil salesmanship?


The company I buy from might just be exploiting another diet fad. How can you tell when a manufacturer is just trying to cash in on the latest health care craze? Most of those companies are all gimmick and no substance. How do you know that the company you choose to buy from is giving you the real deal?

Finding A High Quality Omega-3 Supplement
So, how can you identify the legitimate products through all the smoke? There are a few key factors we looked for in our Omega-3 supplement review that can all but guarantee the product is genuine.
1. Third Party Monitoring: Independent monitoring companies track each company’s reputation and customer satisfaction. One of the most important qualities for a supplement manufacturer is their reputation. Look for a company with a solid reputation backed by third party monitoring.
2. Risk Free Money Back Guarantee: Go with a company that guarantees their product and offers your money back if you aren’t satisfied. If the company is not willing to put their money where their mouth is, that means they don’t believe in their own product.
3. Third Party Testing: Different than third party monitoring, third party testing verifies the quality of each company’s products. Third party testing is really expensive for manufacturers, since it can actually disqualify entire shipments of pills. But when companies don’t have independent quality control, there is no guarantee that their products are what they claim to be.
Omega-3 Brands Research
Your time and money is valuable and we don’t want you to waste either one. So we did the Omega-3 supplement review on most of the top Omega-3 products available.
We studied each product to determine which consistently had not only the right ingredients, but also the right proportions. We disqualified the ones with unnecessary, synthetic fillers and those whose contents differed drastically from pill to pill.
But we didn’t stop there. After all, numbers and percentages are only part of the story. We went on to seek out real customers who had used the products we tested. We asked them for testimonials and compared them with our notes, and then compiled this information to give you a list of the best products on the market.
What our Research Uncovered
A good Omega-3 supplement should contain at least 1500mg daily dose of Omega-3’s, which includes 800mg EPA and 600mg of DHA, and no additional ingredients.
Most brands did not pass the above criteria.
Some of the Omega-3 companies included the right ingredients, but had too little of Omega-3 fish oil, which is the key compound in Omega-3. They use much less than what was used in the clinical studies that led to improved health. Other companies filled their supplements with cheap fillers, binders, and other synthetic ingredients. Almost all of them avoided quality control testing.
The brands we did pick, we stand by. We are confident that these products can help you achieve your goals.
Our Omega-3 Top Pick:
We are excited about our final pick and we think you’ll agree. This company has a solid reputation, a high quality product, third party monitoring and testing. It also has a solid return policy and stands by its products.

#1 Top Pick
Research Verified Omega-3

If you want to try Omega-3, then Research Verified should be your first choice. If any Omega-3 supplement is going to work for you, this is it.

It has the highest quality Omega-3 fish oil, in the right dose, doesn’t have any binders or fillers, and is 100% safe to use.
Quality: They have the recommended daily dose of 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil, which includes 800mg EPA and 600mg DHA.  They only use cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Oils from these fish have a profile of around seven times as much omega-3 oils than other fish.
Reputation: Their reputation is top notch. They have several third party monitoring services, including buySAFE, Norton, and Trustee, as well as an A+ rating from the quality monitoring company QualityTrusted.
Guarantee: All purchases of Research Verified Omega-3 are backed by a 365 day Risk Free 100% Money Back Guarantee. That is the best guarantee that we have seen from any manufacturer. This 1 year guarantee shows how confident they are in their product.
Perhaps most importantly, they’re an established company that offers excellent customer service, safe checkout and on-time delivery.
They clearly have a commitment to quality as well, and guarantee that their supplements are made in an FDA registered laboratory that is cGMP certified.
So, if you’re looking for the best Omega-3 product available from a reputable company with a rock solid 365 day money back guarantee, I’d say this is the product to try.
The only issue with Research Verified is that due to the demand they are often sold out. To avoid having to put yourself on a waiting list, take advantage of the benefits while they’re in stock.

Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA

This product is made by a company called Life Extension, and they are offering an Omega 3 product with deep sea fish, not farm raised fish. However, there is one very important category in which they fall short – the active ingredient. With this product, you will receive only 1200mg of Omega-3 fish oil, as opposed to the recommended dosage of 1500mg.
There are also many negative and positive reviews for this product. The bottle itself will definitely catch your eye, but without consistent positive consumer reviews on the website, purchasing this product might be a bit risky.
Our own tests showed that it was a good product, but we all know that supplements don’t always work the same way for everyone. We would recommend choosing a product that offers you the full recommended daily amount of 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil.
Even though Life Extension Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA seems to have a very good formula, the fact that it does not contain 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil as its active ingredient dosage, and relatively few positive customer reviews knocked it down to the #2 spot. That said, if you don’t mind taking a chance, this product might work for you.
Take a closer look and decide for yourself…

#3 Pick
Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega

Falling just short of our number two selection is Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega. This product contains deep sea fish oil, which was the recommended active ingredient in clinical studies. However, it does not have the recommended dosage of 1500mg Omega-3.
In addition, this product does not have a 365 day money back guarantee. Since the company itself has a good track record and most consumers I spoke to were pretty satisfied with it, I still consider this to be a solid product. Just remember that it has a few slight disadvantages.
Its capsules do not contain the recommended daily dosage of 1500mg of Omega-3 fish oil. Anything less than the recommended daily dosage of Omega-3 fish oil will greatly affect your health improvement goals.
If you don’t mind taking a pill containing a lower dosage than what was recommended in clinical studies, then this product could be right for you. Keep in mind that their website often shows that they are in short supply or out of stock.
Take a better look at the actual product…

What Did We Research?
With hundreds of manufacturers out there, we wanted to figure out what to look for and how to overcome our concerns regarding health care products. We started the process by making a list of the main concerns we have over buying a good Omega-3 product.

It’s not going to be effective. The truth is, there are a lot of products that don’t work at all. Typically, this is because they don’t contain the right ingredients or the right proportions. A lot of interested consumers don’t realize how exact a science creating an effective supplement really is.


It’s going to be too expensive to afford. As we conducted our research, we found that a lot of companies sell Omega-3 for $100 or more! Who wants to risk that kind of money on what could just be snake oil salesmanship?


The company I buy from might just be exploiting another diet fad. How can you tell when a manufacturer is just trying to cash in on the latest health care craze? Most of those companies are all gimmick and no substance. How do you know that the company you choose to buy from is giving you the real deal?

Finding A High Quality Omega-3 Supplement
So, how can you identify the legitimate products through all the smoke? There are a few key factors we looked for in our Omega-3 supplement review that can all but guarantee the product is genuine.
1. Third Party Monitoring: Independent monitoring companies track each company’s reputation and customer satisfaction. One of the most important qualities for a supplement manufacturer is their reputation. Look for a company with a solid reputation backed by third party monitoring.
2. Risk Free Money Back Guarantee: Go with a company that guarantees their product and offers your money back if you aren’t satisfied. If the company is not willing to put their money where their mouth is, that means they don’t believe in their own product.
3. Third Party Testing: Different than third party monitoring, third party testing verifies the quality of each company’s products. Third party testing is really expensive for manufacturers, since it can actually disqualify entire shipments of pills. But when companies don’t have independent quality control, there is no guarantee that their products are what they claim to be.
Omega-3 Brands Research
Your time and money is valuable and we don’t want you to waste either one. So we did the Omega-3 supplement review on most of the top Omega-3 products available.
We studied each product to determine which consistently had not only the right ingredients, but also the right proportions. We disqualified the ones with unnecessary, synthetic fillers and those whose contents differed drastically from pill to pill.
But we didn’t stop there. After all, numbers and percentages are only part of the story. We went on to seek out real customers who had used the products we tested. We asked them for testimonials and compared them with our notes, and then compiled this information to give you a list of the best products on the market.
What our Research Uncovered
A good Omega-3 supplement should contain at least 1500mg daily dose of Omega-3’s, which includes 800mg EPA and 600mg of DHA, and no additional ingredients.
Most brands did not pass the above criteria.
Some of the Omega-3 companies included the right ingredients, but had too little of Omega-3 fish oil, which is the key compound in Omega-3. They use much less than what was used in the clinical studies that led to improved health. Other companies filled their supplements with cheap fillers, binders, and other synthetic ingredients. Almost all of them avoided quality control testing.
The brands we did pick, we stand by. We are confident that these products can help you achieve your goals.
Our Omega-3 Top Pick:
We are excited about our final pick and we think you’ll agree. This company has a solid reputation, a high quality product, third party monitoring and testing. It also has a solid return policy and stands by its products.

Research Verified Omega-3

If you want to try Omega-3, then Research Verified should be your first choice. If any Omega-3 supplement is going to work for you, this is it.

It has the highest quality Omega-3 fish oil, in the right dose, doesn’t have any binders or fillers, and is 100% safe to use.
Quality: They have the recommended daily dose of 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil, which includes 800mg EPA and 600mg DHA.  They only use cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Oils from these fish have a profile of around seven times as much omega-3 oils than other fish.
Reputation: Their reputation is top notch. They have several third party monitoring services, including buySAFE, Norton, and Trustee, as well as an A+ rating from the quality monitoring company QualityTrusted.
Guarantee: All purchases of Research Verified Omega-3 are backed by a 365 day Risk Free 100% Money Back Guarantee. That is the best guarantee that we have seen from any manufacturer. This 1 year guarantee shows how confident they are in their product.
Perhaps most importantly, they’re an established company that offers excellent customer service, safe checkout and on-time delivery.
They clearly have a commitment to quality as well, and guarantee that their supplements are made in an FDA registered laboratory that is cGMP certified.
So, if you’re looking for the best Omega-3 product available from a reputable company with a rock solid 365 day money back guarantee, I’d say this is the product to try.
The only issue with Research Verified is that due to the demand they are often sold out. To avoid having to put yourself on a waiting list, take advantage of the benefits while they’re in stock.

Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA

This product is made by a company called Life Extension, and they are offering an Omega 3 product with deep sea fish, not farm raised fish. However, there is one very important category in which they fall short – the active ingredient. With this product, you will receive only 1200mg of Omega-3 fish oil, as opposed to the recommended dosage of 1500mg.
There are also many negative and positive reviews for this product. The bottle itself will definitely catch your eye, but without consistent positive consumer reviews on the website, purchasing this product might be a bit risky.
Our own tests showed that it was a good product, but we all know that supplements don’t always work the same way for everyone. We would recommend choosing a product that offers you the full recommended daily amount of 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil.
Even though Life Extension Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA seems to have a very good formula, the fact that it does not contain 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil as its active ingredient dosage, and relatively few positive customer reviews knocked it down to the #2 spot. That said, if you don’t mind taking a chance, this product might work for you.
Take a closer look and decide for yourself…

#3 Pick
Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega

Falling just short of our number two selection is Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega. This product contains deep sea fish oil, which was the recommended active ingredient in clinical studies. However, it does not have the recommended dosage of 1500mg Omega-3.
In addition, this product does not have a 365 day money back guarantee. Since the company itself has a good track record and most consumers I spoke to were pretty satisfied with it, I still consider this to be a solid product. Just remember that it has a few slight disadvantages.
Its capsules do not contain the recommended daily dosage of 1500mg of Omega-3 fish oil. Anything less than the recommended daily dosage of Omega-3 fish oil will greatly affect your health improvement goals.
If you don’t mind taking a pill containing a lower dosage than what was recommended in clinical studies, then this product could be right for you. Keep in mind that their website often shows that they are in short supply or out of stock.
Take a better look at the actual product…

Is Your Omega-3 Effective?
How To Pick An Omega-3 Supplement That Works
And Get It At A Great Price

ConsumerReview doesn’t often review health care supplements, but with all the media craze surrounding Omega-3, we decided it was time to write a no-holds-barred exclusive Omega-3 supplement review.
Since Omega-3 was popularized due to over 8,000 clinical studies, supplement manufacturers have been crawling out of the woodwork to create their ‘version’ of Omega-3, with wild claims as to its actual benefits. As each new company bursts into the market with their own ‘proprietary formula’, it becomes harder to separate fact from fiction, premium product from worthless imitation.
We decided it was time to analyze them ourselves to find out which products were sub-par, which were flat-out lying about what was even in their pills, and which, if any, might actually be worth a try.
As we rounded up all of the big brands in the industry for our Omega-3 supplement review, we could see straight off the bat which companies were only there to make a quick buck.

One thing we found was that many manufacturers exceeded the recommended 1,500mg dosage and did not have enough EPA and DHA, which will greatly affect your health improvement goals.
Secondly, we found that many manufactures were using farm raised fish, not deep sea fish. It is always better to buy a product that uses high quality, all natural ingredients, not compounds created in the lab.

It’s hard to believe, but most companies slap on a label that says ‘Omega-3’, often without even mentioning how much Omega-3 is in each pill or without actually including the amount they claim.
