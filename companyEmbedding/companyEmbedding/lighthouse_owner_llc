Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

LLC FAQs - Frequently Asked Legal Questions About Limited Liability Companies | LegalZoom























Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

              Home security with smart AI.
            


              False alerts are practically a “feature” on home security cameras
              because their ordinary sensors get tricked by pets, headlights and
              moving shadows. Lighthouse camera's AI monitoring eliminates false alerts using a 3D sensor
              and machine learning, so it only notifies you when it
              detects actual movement triggered by a person it doesn’t recognize.
              Hit the siren or call the police, right from the alert.

              Need to know?  Just ask.
            


              Want to know “What did the kids do with the babysitter?”
              or “What did the dog do after I left?”  Instead of scrubbing
              through hours of boring home security camera footage or watching live view all day, all you
              have to do is ask, and the right moments appear instantly.
              It's not actually magic, but your friends will think it is.

              Tell Lighthouse what you care about.
            


              Simply ask
              "Ping me if the kids don't come home by 4pm on weekdays" or "Let me know when you
              see John with the dog while I'm out."  Or maybe just "Tell me when you see the
              cat jumping in the kitchen."  It's so much better than being alerted “something
              moved” for the umpteenth time.

              Wave to say hello. Naturally.
            


              The Lighthouse camera recognizes natural gestures, like a simple wave.
              So while you’re away from home, your kids can wave to the camera
              to send you a hello that goes right to your phone. With two-way
              talk, you can say hello right back.

              "I am lucky enough to have 3 Lighthouse devices throughout my house. I love them for many reasons - they do a great job at classifying and alerting me when appropriate, and I am super impressed with how quick feeds load and how clear and crisp they are. The overall design is also beautiful, and it is easy to find a spot for it."

            True Alerts
          


              Since Lighthouse only triggers on 3D movement
              and understands what it's looking at, you'll only
              receive security alerts when there's actually a person that warrants your attention. You’ll see a snapshot
              right on your phone’s lock screen, so you can decide if immediate action is required.
              And Lighthouse automatically enables and disables alerts based on
              whether you're home, so you, your family and trusted guests can
              come and go without triggering unwanted alerts.
              No more 4-digit access codes.
            




                Person recognition
          


              Using facial recognition, Lighthouse learns your household's members and guests,
              so you know instantly who's coming and going, and if someone new arrives on the scene.
            




                Live stream
          


              See your home live in beautiful 1080p, with support for portrait and landscape modes.
            




                Emergency activation
          


              When you’re alerted to a possible security threat, you can sound a
              siren, speak through the camera or call the police—right from the app.
            




                Night vision
          


              With high quality night vision, Lighthouse keeps watch even
              after the lights go down.
            




                Fine-grained access control
          


              Invite family members and guests to your home, and
              control permissions for viewing video and receiving notifications.
            







		Search SVG icon: Lighthouse-smart-home-camera
	





































                Voice and text search
          


              When it comes to home, you’re always on a need-to-know basis.
              With the Lighthouse app, all you have to do is ask.
              Instead of scrubbing through hours of video, you can just ask. Some examples:
              

 "What did the kids do while I was out yesterday?"
              
 "Has the cat done anything interesting since I left?"
              
 "Who did you see at the front door on Tuesday between 8 and 10am?"
              
 "Have you seen the kids running around recently?"
              
 "Did you see Chris with the dog at the front door last week while I was away?"
              

              And if you’re the quiet type, you can instead type a brief search -
              just like you're Googling your home.

            




                HaloVision
          


              Any time you go back and review recorded video, color-coded halos
              make it easy to follow and sort out activity around adults,
              children and pets. And they’re just so cool.

		Activity SVG icon: Lighthouse-indoor-camera
	























                Pings
          


              Ask Lighthouse to ping you the moment something important happens - or doesn't happen.  Five seconds to set up, endless peace of mind.

              
 "If you don't see the kids by 4pm on weekdays while I'm away, let me know."
                
 "Tell me if you see the kids alone in the garage."
                
 "Send me a ping when John gets home today."
                
 "Ping me if Dana doesn't arrive on Saturdays between 10 and 11am."
                
 "Notify me if you see the kids downstairs between 10pm and 6am."
                
 "When the cat jumps on the kitchen table, send me a notification."
                
 "Alert me if you don't see someone with the dog at the front door between 12 and 2pm when I'm out."
                 "Let me know if no one enters the kitchen between 4pm and 8pm."
                






            Rich notifications
          


              Know exactly what’s going on, without even opening the app.
              Get a preview of security alerts and pings, right from your phone’s lock screen.
            




                Activity feed
          


              See the day’s important events, such as how long someone’s been home, who’s been coming and going,
              the camera being armed and disarmed, and security alerts, all in one place.
            




                All systems go
          


            With the tri-color LED indicator on the camera or a quick check of
            the app, you can instantly check that Lighthouse is online,
            recording and streaming.
          







		Communication SVG icon: Lighthouse-smart-home-device
	




























            Wave hello
          


              Since Lighthouse is smart enough to recognize a friendly wave,
              family members can say hello when you’re away just by waving to
              the camera. So enjoy the hug away from home or use the mic to chat
              and check in live.
            




                Two-way talk
          


              Listen and speak to family members and guests — of both the two
              and four-legged variety — using the built-in speaker and microphone.
              For added privacy and control, you can turn audio on and off whenever you’d like.

      Lighthouse: About us
    



























          01_Our_Vision
        


        Building the future of our dreams.
      

        There’s nothing like the feeling of knowing when you’re part of
        something new. Something exciting. And something meaningful. We live in
        a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial
        intelligence, computer vision, deep learning and natural language
        processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and
        everyday lives. And for us, one of the most interesting possibilities
        is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most: our home.
      





          02_Our_Story
        


        The start of something big.
      

        Lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of Stanford,
        where our CTO and Co-founder Hendrik Dahlkamp worked on Stanley,
        Stanford’s pioneering self-driving car. After being on the first team to
        ever win the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles, Hendrik
        continued his work in Sebastian Thrun’s lab, where he met our CEO and
        Co-founder Alex Teichman, an expert in semi-supervised learning on
        3D sensors. The two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled
        advancements in computer vision and depth perception.  Alex and Hendrik
        saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative
        ways, and Lighthouse was born.

          132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge course in the Mojave Desert.

        Our founders.
      








          Alex Teichman — CEO and Co-founder
        



            While receiving his PhD in computer science, Alex led Stanford’s research
            on self-driving car perception, inventing machine learning techniques that
            enabled self-driving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead
            of requiring large-scale human annotation. Intrigued by the
            potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial
            intelligence, he was inspired to leverage these new technologies
            for real-world applications in the home. Alex has an undergrad degree
            in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, and a
            PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University.
        










          Hendrik Dahlkamp — CTO and Co-founder
        



            Hendrik previously co-founded two companies, both acquired by Google.
            His work led to the creation of Google Street View, Google Maps’
            turn-by-turn directions and gesture recognition that was
            incorporated into Android’s technology. He is a DARPA Grand
            Challenge winner for Stanley, the first self-driving car, and was
            the first engineer at Google X. Hendrik has a BS in Computer
            Science and Math and an MS in Computer Science from
            Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. He left
            Stanford University’s PhD program to become an entrepreneur.

      Lighthouse: Technology
    




















              Seriously state of the art.
            

              Through our founders' PhD work on self-driving cars at Stanford -
              where they built Stanley, the first autonomous car to complete
              the 132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge race - it became clear that
              combining cameras with 3D sensors would enable extraordinary
              computer vision capabilities. For the first time we’re
              bringing that technology into the home, so Lighthouse sees
              and understands your world as you do.
            








              3D makes the extraordinary possible.
            

              Lighthouse has a custom optical module featuring the first-ever
              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after
              bouncing off objects in the environment, producing a
              continuously updating 3D model of the scene - fundamental to the advanced
              computer vision that makes the Lighthouse experience possible.
            















              Seriously state of the art.
            


              Through our founders' PhD work on self-driving cars at Stanford -
              where they built Stanley, the first autonomous car to complete
              the 132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge race - it became clear that
              combining cameras with 3D sensors would enable extraordinary
              computer vision capabilities. For the first time we’re
              bringing that technology into the home, so Lighthouse sees
              and understands your world as you do.
            

































              3D makes the extraordinary possible.
            

              Lighthouse has a custom optical module featuring the first-ever
              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after
              bouncing off objects in the environment, producing a
              continuously updating 3D model of the scene - fundamental to the advanced
              computer vision that makes the Lighthouse experience possible.
            














                  3D MAPPING
                





                  False alerts, gone forever. Really.
                

                  Because Lighthouse directly measures the full 3D structure of the environment, we’ve eliminated the
                  false alerts from changing light conditions and shadows that plague
                  all other home cameras.
                












                  DEEP LEARNING
                





                  Always (machine) learning.
                

                  We’ve spent over two years building machine learning models that can
                  accurately classify dogs, cats, children and adults, and ignore movement
                  from objects like curtains or fans. 3D sensing makes it possible to
                  understand the motion of objects through space and time,
                  enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale
                  quantitative testing.
                












                  PERSON RECOGNITION
                





                  Next-level person identification.
                

                  Our team of computer vision PhDs have built models that allow
                  Lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown
                  faces.  And 3D sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that
                  identify a known person by size, shape or movement, even when it
                  can’t see a face.
                












                  ACTION RECOGNITION
                





                  Action recognition beyond simple gestures.
                

                  Using action recognition models trained on the 3D sensor,
                  we’re able to distinguish and alert you to interesting
                  activity in your home, like your dog jumping on the counter,
                  kids running around or a loved one waving hello.
                














            All spec’d out.
          

            A look at Lighthouse by the numbers.

I’ve been in commercial stock photography for several years using all canon equipment (50mp 5DSR and canon lenses) and a studio environment for the majority of my productions. All my images are ISO 100 at the highest resolution level- perfect for large scale printouts.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

              Home security with smart AI.
            


              False alerts are practically a “feature” on home security cameras
              because their ordinary sensors get tricked by pets, headlights and
              moving shadows. Lighthouse camera's AI monitoring eliminates false alerts using a 3D sensor
              and machine learning, so it only notifies you when it
              detects actual movement triggered by a person it doesn’t recognize.
              Hit the siren or call the police, right from the alert.

              Need to know?  Just ask.
            


              Want to know “What did the kids do with the babysitter?”
              or “What did the dog do after I left?”  Instead of scrubbing
              through hours of boring home security camera footage or watching live view all day, all you
              have to do is ask, and the right moments appear instantly.
              It's not actually magic, but your friends will think it is.

              Tell Lighthouse what you care about.
            


              Simply ask
              "Ping me if the kids don't come home by 4pm on weekdays" or "Let me know when you
              see John with the dog while I'm out."  Or maybe just "Tell me when you see the
              cat jumping in the kitchen."  It's so much better than being alerted “something
              moved” for the umpteenth time.

              Wave to say hello. Naturally.
            


              The Lighthouse camera recognizes natural gestures, like a simple wave.
              So while you’re away from home, your kids can wave to the camera
              to send you a hello that goes right to your phone. With two-way
              talk, you can say hello right back.

            "Lighthouse has integrated computer vision technology into a device
            allowing it to identify the difference between people, pets, etc.,
            which eliminates false alarms. Add in the ability to set custom
            notifications and search through your recordings and it is unique to the market."

            "Initially, I thought Lighthouse was just a next-gen security system,
            but after using it, it has become apparent that it’s much more.
            I can customize it to ping me about events I specifically care
            about at home. Not only does this give continuous assurance,
            it also simplifies my life."

I love them for many reasons - they do a great job at classifying and alerting me when appropriate, and I am super impressed with how quick feeds load and how clear and crisp they are. The overall design is also beautiful, and it is easy to find a spot for it."

                "I am lucky enough to have 3 Lighthouse devices throughout my house. I love them for many reasons -
              they do a great job at classifying and alerting me when appropriate, and I am
              super impressed with how quick feeds load and how clear and crisp they are. The overall
              design is also beautiful, and it is easy to find a spot for it."

            True Alerts
          


              Since Lighthouse only triggers on 3D movement
              and understands what it's looking at, you'll only
              receive security alerts when there's actually a person that warrants your attention. You’ll see a snapshot
              right on your phone’s lock screen, so you can decide if immediate action is required.
              And Lighthouse automatically enables and disables alerts based on
              whether you're home, so you, your family and trusted guests can
              come and go without triggering unwanted alerts.
              No more 4-digit access codes.
            




                Person recognition
          


              Using facial recognition, Lighthouse learns your household's members and guests,
              so you know instantly who's coming and going, and if someone new arrives on the scene.
            




                Live stream
          


              See your home live in beautiful 1080p, with support for portrait and landscape modes.
            




                Emergency activation
          


              When you’re alerted to a possible security threat, you can sound a
              siren, speak through the camera or call the police—right from the app.
            




                Night vision
          


              With high quality night vision, Lighthouse keeps watch even
              after the lights go down.
            




                Fine-grained access control
          


              Invite family members and guests to your home, and
              control permissions for viewing video and receiving notifications.
            







		Search SVG icon: Lighthouse-smart-home-camera
	





































                Voice and text search
          


              When it comes to home, you’re always on a need-to-know basis.
              With the Lighthouse app, all you have to do is ask.
              Instead of scrubbing through hours of video, you can just ask. Some examples:
              

 "What did the kids do while I was out yesterday?"
              
 "Has the cat done anything interesting since I left?"
              
 "Who did you see at the front door on Tuesday between 8 and 10am?"
              
 "Have you seen the kids running around recently?"
              
 "Did you see Chris with the dog at the front door last week while I was away?"
              

              And if you’re the quiet type, you can instead type a brief search -
              just like you're Googling your home.

            




                HaloVision
          


              Any time you go back and review recorded video, color-coded halos
              make it easy to follow and sort out activity around adults,
              children and pets. And they’re just so cool.
            




                Daily Recap
          


              Review the events of the day with one tap. Timelapse videos
              automatically skip past periods of inactivity, so you can go
              straight to the action. Be in the know, in less than a minute.
            




                Save and share
          


              Select, download and share Lighthouse clips in just a few taps.
            




                All your cameras in one place
          


              Easily switch views and search for activity across multiple cameras or multiple homes.
            







		Activity SVG icon: Lighthouse-indoor-camera
	























                Pings
          


              Ask Lighthouse to ping you the moment something important happens - or doesn't happen.  Five seconds to set up, endless peace of mind.

              
 "If you don't see the kids by 4pm on weekdays while I'm away, let me know."
                
 "Tell me if you see the kids alone in the garage."
                
 "Send me a ping when John gets home today."
                
 "Ping me if Dana doesn't arrive on Saturdays between 10 and 11am."
                
 "Notify me if you see the kids downstairs between 10pm and 6am."
                
 "When the cat jumps on the kitchen table, send me a notification."
                
 "Alert me if you don't see someone with the dog at the front door between 12 and 2pm when I'm out."
                 "Let me know if no one enters the kitchen between 4pm and 8pm."
                






            Rich notifications
          


              Know exactly what’s going on, without even opening the app.
              Get a preview of security alerts and pings, right from your phone’s lock screen.
            




                Activity feed
          


              See the day’s important events, such as how long someone’s been home, who’s been coming and going,
              the camera being armed and disarmed, and security alerts, all in one place.
            




                All systems go
          


            With the tri-color LED indicator on the camera or a quick check of
            the app, you can instantly check that Lighthouse is online,
            recording and streaming.
          







		Communication SVG icon: Lighthouse-smart-home-device
	




























            Wave hello
          


              Since Lighthouse is smart enough to recognize a friendly wave,
              family members can say hello when you’re away just by waving to
              the camera. So enjoy the hug away from home or use the mic to chat
              and check in live.
            




                Two-way talk
          


              Listen and speak to family members and guests — of both the two
              and four-legged variety — using the built-in speaker and microphone.
              For added privacy and control, you can turn audio on and off whenever you’d like.
            







		Privacy SVG icon: Lighthouse-smart-home-camera
	











                Encryption
          


              All connections are encrypted using bank-grade
              TLS/SSL with 2048-bit keys and AES-256 session encryption.
              Users log in using industry leading SRP-6a/PBKDF2 protocol.
              Device software is tamper-proof via a digitally signed bootloader and updates.
              All data is stored encrypted at rest with AES-256.
              Read more





            Data Privacy
          


              Your data is your own, period. No one will ever view your data
              without your explicit permission, and we will never sell your data
              for any reason. All data is encrypted at rest and expunged completely
              after 30 days.
              Read more





                Privacy you can control
          


              You can set the camera feed and audio to automatically pause recording when you return home,
              and resume when you leave, so your private time is your own.  No one sees your data unless
              you explicitly share it.
            
















              Service
          


              For the same price that traditional cameras charge simply for storage,
              Lighthouse’s low monthly fee gives you access to all of these features,
              making it the most sophisticated combination of hardware and software ever included with a home device:

      Lighthouse: Technology
    




















              Seriously state of the art.
            

              Through our founders' PhD work on self-driving cars at Stanford -
              where they built Stanley, the first autonomous car to complete
              the 132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge race - it became clear that
              combining cameras with 3D sensors would enable extraordinary
              computer vision capabilities. For the first time we’re
              bringing that technology into the home, so Lighthouse sees
              and understands your world as you do.
            








              3D makes the extraordinary possible.
            

              Lighthouse has a custom optical module featuring the first-ever
              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after
              bouncing off objects in the environment, producing a
              continuously updating 3D model of the scene - fundamental to the advanced
              computer vision that makes the Lighthouse experience possible.

                  3D MAPPING
                





                  False alerts, gone forever. Really.
                

                  Because Lighthouse directly measures the full 3D structure of the environment, we’ve eliminated the
                  false alerts from changing light conditions and shadows that plague
                  all other home cameras.
                












                  DEEP LEARNING
                





                  Always (machine) learning.
                

                  We’ve spent over two years building machine learning models that can
                  accurately classify dogs, cats, children and adults, and ignore movement
                  from objects like curtains or fans. 3D sensing makes it possible to
                  understand the motion of objects through space and time,
                  enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale
                  quantitative testing.
                












                  PERSON RECOGNITION
                





                  Next-level person identification.
                

                  Our team of computer vision PhDs have built models that allow
                  Lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown
                  faces.  And 3D sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that
                  identify a known person by size, shape or movement, even when it
                  can’t see a face.
                












                  ACTION RECOGNITION
                





                  Action recognition beyond simple gestures.
                

                  Using action recognition models trained on the 3D sensor,
                  we’re able to distinguish and alert you to interesting
                  activity in your home, like your dog jumping on the counter,
                  kids running around or a loved one waving hello.
                














            All spec’d out.

      Lighthouse: About us
    



























          01_Our_Vision
        


        Building the future of our dreams.
      

        There’s nothing like the feeling of knowing when you’re part of
        something new. Something exciting. And something meaningful. We live in
        a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial
        intelligence, computer vision, deep learning and natural language
        processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and
        everyday lives. And for us, one of the most interesting possibilities
        is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most: our home.
      





          02_Our_Story
        


        The start of something big.
      

        Lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of Stanford,
        where our CTO and Co-founder Hendrik Dahlkamp worked on Stanley,
        Stanford’s pioneering self-driving car. After being on the first team to
        ever win the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles, Hendrik
        continued his work in Sebastian Thrun’s lab, where he met our CEO and
        Co-founder Alex Teichman, an expert in semi-supervised learning on
        3D sensors. The two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled
        advancements in computer vision and depth perception.  Alex and Hendrik
        saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative
        ways, and Lighthouse was born.

        Our founders.
      








          Alex Teichman — CEO and Co-founder
        



            While receiving his PhD in computer science, Alex led Stanford’s research
            on self-driving car perception, inventing machine learning techniques that
            enabled self-driving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead
            of requiring large-scale human annotation. Intrigued by the
            potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial
            intelligence, he was inspired to leverage these new technologies
            for real-world applications in the home. Alex has an undergrad degree
            in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, and a
            PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University.
        










          Hendrik Dahlkamp — CTO and Co-founder
        



            Hendrik previously co-founded two companies, both acquired by Google.
            His work led to the creation of Google Street View, Google Maps’
            turn-by-turn directions and gesture recognition that was
            incorporated into Android’s technology. He is a DARPA Grand
            Challenge winner for Stanley, the first self-driving car, and was
            the first engineer at Google X. Hendrik has a BS in Computer
            Science and Math and an MS in Computer Science from
            Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. He left
            Stanford University’s PhD program to become an entrepreneur.
