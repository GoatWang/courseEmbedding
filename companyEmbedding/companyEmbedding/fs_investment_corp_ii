1Represents the institutional offering price of FSIC III’s common stock. The institutional offering price is subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5%. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC III’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully. In February 2016, FSIC III closed its public offering to investors who purchase shares of its common stock through the independent broker-dealer channel.
        

2The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSIC III’s institutional offering price per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares of common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of FSIC III’s distributions were funded through net investment income on a tax basis. No portion of FSIC III’s distributions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was funded through expense reimbursements from FSIC III’s sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC III’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSIC III’s total operating expenses and excise taxes as a percentage of average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

1
Institutional Stockholder Returns are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC III's institutional offering price at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC III's distribution reinvestment plan ("DRP"). Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC III’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
Although FSIC III closed its offering to new investors investing through independent broker-dealers in February 2016, it continues to offer shares to new investors through the institutional channel at the institutional offering price. FSIC III’s shares are no longer subject to a sales load, but are still subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5% of the gross proceeds received in its offering. FSIC III’s ratio of total operating expenses to average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

      View risk factors disclosure




Investing in FSIC III may be considered speculative and involves a high level of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in the section of FSIC III’s prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC III’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC III’s common stock and FSIC III is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before FSIC III completes a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than you paid for them. While FSIC III intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for its shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC III may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. In addition, any such repurchases will be at the current institutional offering price on the date of repurchase. FSIC III intends to invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid. FSIC III’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available toFSIC III for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC III’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC III’s investments may adversely affect its business.FSIC III is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on its investments.FSIC III has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of its investments and may increase the risks of investing in its securities.FSIC III has limited operating history and is subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.If FSIC III is unable to raise substantial funds in its ongoing, continuous “best efforts” public offering, then FSIC III will be more limited in the number and type of investments it may make.FSIC III is a long-term investment for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment. To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. FSIC III’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisoryfees that are subject to repayment to its affiliate, FS Investments, and FSIC III’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of thesedistributions may not be based on FSIC III’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments were notto reimburse certain of FSIC III’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds orborrowings. The repayment of any amount owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled. 







To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. An investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves significant costs and investors should review the information in FSIC III’s prospectus regarding fees and expenses. Corporate governanceFS Investment Solutions, LLC | 201 Rouse Boulevard | Philadelphia, PA 19112877-372-9880 | Member FINRA/SIPC

1The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular monthly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSIC II’s net asset value (NAV) per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC II’s shares of common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC II’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of FSIC II’s distributions were funded through net investment income, on a tax basis. No portion of FSIC II’s distributions during the three months ended March 31, 2017, was funded through expense reimbursements from FSIC II’s sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC II’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC II’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC II’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSIC II’s total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common stock was 8.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
        

2The distribution reinvestment price is subject to change. The price at which shares of FSIC II’s common stock are issued under its distribution reinvestment plan is determined by FSIC II’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, at a price per share that is (i) not less than the NAV per share immediately prior to the payment of the distribution and (ii) not more than 2.5% greater than the NAV per share as of such date.

1FSIC II’s Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. Except for the YTD, 1 Year and 3 Year periods, the calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC II’s public offering price, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC II’s distribution reinvestment plan (“DRP”). Since FSIC II closed its public offering in March 2014 and has since issued new shares only pursuant to its DRP, the calculation of FSIC II’s Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) for the YTD, 1 Year and 3 Year periods assumes that the investor purchased shares at the beginning of the applicable period at a price based upon FSIC II’s DRP on such date. Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC II’s share repurchase program on such date. Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could total up to 10% of FSIC II’s public offering price. Had such selling commissions and dealer manager fees been included, performance would be lower. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
FSIC II is closed to new investors. FSIC II’s total expenses as a percentage to average net assets attributable to common stock was 8.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Stockholder Return (With Sales Charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC II’s public offering price, including the maximum selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC II’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC II’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC II’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC II’s board of directors, and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

      View risk factors disclosure




An investment in the common stock of FSIC II involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC II’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in FSIC II’s annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC II’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC II’s common stock and FSIC II is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. While FSIC II intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for its shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC II may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.FSIC II’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to FSIC II for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses.An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC II’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC II’s investments may adversely affect its business.FSIC II is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on FSIC II’s investments.FSIC II has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of FSIC II’s investments and may increase the risks of investing in our securities.FSIC II is a long-term investment for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment.FSIC II’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees that were subject to repayment to its affiliate, FS Investments. Significant portions of these distributions were not based on FSIC II’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments had not agreed to reimburse certain of FSIC II’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions would have come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of amounts owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled.
