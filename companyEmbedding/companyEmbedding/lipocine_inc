Corporate Governance



 





Lipocine is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing innovative pharmaceutical products for use in men’s and women’s health using its proprietary drug delivery technologies. Lipocine product development pipeline entails repositioning of established drugs with significantly improved patient compliance through an efficient 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway strategy.
LPCN 1021 is an oral testosterone replacement product candidate containing Testosterone Undecanoate that is designed to help restore normal testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. LPCN 1021 was well tolerated and met the primary end-point in Phase 3 testing and is currently being studied in two additional Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe LPCN 1021 is a patient-preferred alternative to current non-orals without potential liability of accidental testosterone transfer to women and children; reliably restores and maintains testosterone levels; is  more convenient  than currently marketed products and has the potential to improve patient’s therapy, adherence and retention.
LPCN 1111 is a novel next generation oral testosterone  replacement product candidate  with potential for once-daily oral dosing and is currently in Phase 2 testing.
LPCN 1107 is targeted to be the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate product candidate indicated for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth and has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA with an end of Phase 2 meeting completed with the FDA.

LPCN 1021: Oral Product Candidate for Testosterone Replacement Therapy
LPCN 1021 is a novel oral product candidate of Testosterone (T) containing Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) that is designed to help restore normal T levels in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.
LPCN 1021 is designed to overcome many of the issues related to TRT products on the U.S. market. LPCN 1021 received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA on June 28, 2016 with two new clinical studies being conducted to address the deficiency cited. LPCN 1021 is being studied for both Primary and Secondary hypogonadism and is targeted to the established chronic US TRT market.

The Future Of Lipocine's Lead Product Candidate, LPCN1021 - Lipocine Inc. (NASDAQ:LPCN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Future Of Lipocine's Lead Product Candidate, LPCN1021Jun. 8.17 | About: Lipocine Inc. (LPCN) Emerging Equities Special situations, long/short equitySummaryTop-line data from lead product candidate LPCN 1021 is expected by June 2017 and resubmission of the NDA is planned for the third quarter of 2017.
        Lipocine has a patent issue with its lead product candidate LPCN 1021.
        The law suit could be a major setback for Lipocine’s LPCN 1021.
        Lipocine (NASDAQ:LPCN) is facing a lot of trouble with its TRT therapy LPCN 1021. There's the yet-unresolved CRL, and although they are progressing through a trial that addresses the CRL, the FDA's known antagonism to TRT therapy acts as a major hindrance. On top of that, they have a patent lawsuit challenging LPCN 1021, and although the lawsuit was dismissed, it was only because the drug did not get approved. Once it does, the lawsuit will come back; and with the, any hope of securing a partner will vanish. Overall, the prospect is gloomy. The company recently announced that they have completed the enrollment in both the dosing validation (NYSE:DV) and dosing flexibility (NYSE:DF) studies for LPCN 1021. Top-line results from these studies are expected in June 2017 and resubmission of the New Drug Application (NDA) for LPCN 1021 is expected in the third quarter of 2017. In a recent press release Lipocine announced that the DV study will assess LPCN 1021 in hypogonadal males on a fixed daily dose of 450 mg divided into two equal doses. The DV study is an open-label, fixed dose, no titration single treatment arm study of LPCN 1021. Efficacy will be assessed via responder analysis at the end of the dosing period which is 24 days. The pre-specified primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects with an average 24-hour serum testosterone concentration (Cavg) within the normal range, with secondary endpoints based on maximum serum testosterone concentrations (Cmax). However, interestingly, Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lipocine Inc. in U.S. District Court in Delaware. Dr. Robert Dudley, President and CEO of Clarus and co-inventor of the patent in question, stated, "We remain strong in our belief that LPCN-1021 infringes Clarus's '428 patent and it is particularly noteworthy that the court did not rule on this central fact. If LPCN-1021 were to be approved by the FDA, our plan would be to vigorously pursue all avenues to keep Lipocine's LPCN-1021 from entering the market and protect the intellectual property, accompanying financial investment and years of work we have invested in JATENZO - our oral TRT product. We continue to advance the development of JATENZO which is being evaluated in a new Phase 3 study that is near completion."
 Earlier in June 2016 Lipocine Inc. received a Complete Response Letter (NYSE:CRL) from the FDA which means its NDA is not approvable in its present form. The CRL cited deficiencies related to the dosing algorithm. Specifically, the proposed titration scheme in the labeling was significantly different that the titration scheme used in the Phase 3 study which would lead to different titration decisions between the clinical trial and clinical practice. The court found that there was not an immediate reason to hear the case given Lipocine's failure to receive FDA market approval for LPCN-1021. Importantly, the decision was made without ruling on the validity of Clarus's U.S. Patent 8,828,428 and other merits of the case. Court dismissed the lawsuit due to lack of FDA approval for LPCN1021 and not on merits of case, Clarus will be allowed to refile its lawsuit, if necessary. In other words, even if LPCN is successful with the FDA in regard to testosterone replacement therapy (NYSEMKT:TRT), Clarus will just restart the lawsuit and has a high chance for preventing LPCN1021 from entering the market. If FDA approves LPCN1021, Lipocine will have a difficult time finding a marketing partner with decent terms. As a minimum, one would expect that a potential partner to want the patent issue with Clarus resolved, which could potentially delay product launch. Clarus is obviously well aware of the situation, and is likely willing to let the patent fight drag for longer period of time, in the mean time they continue to advance the development of JATENZO - their oral TRT product. Another major setback for the testosterone replacement therapy is the safety concerns from FDA. The FDA cautions about using testosterone products for low testosterone due to aging which requires labeling change to inform of possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking testosterone. Lipocine investors will have to keep a close eye on the stock. The TRT market is volatile for companies to succeed. The compliance issues also may be a hurdle for Lipocine to overcome, No matter what happens, it will certainly be an interesting next few months. Lipocine needs to deal with the law suit once its gets the approval for LPCN1021 which the company expects to get by resubmitting of the New Drug Application (NDA) for LPCN 1021 which is expected in the third quarter of 2017.
 Lipocine reported a net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. Research and development expenses were $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared with $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses were $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared with $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2016. As of March 31, 2016, Lipocine had cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities of $26.8 million. Given the cash scenario, the early stage of the rest of the pipeline, and the precarious situation surrounding LPCN 1021 itself, this does not look like a sound long term investment at this time.

Lipocine Inc. Announces Submission of SPA on LPCN 1107
Jun 26 17
Lipocine Inc. announced that it has submitted a Special Protocol Assessment request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the ongoing interaction with the FDA on the detailed design of the planned Phase 3 clinical development program for LPCN 1107 for prevention of recurrent preterm birth with history of singleton pregnancy. An SPA is an advanced declaration from the FDA that a planned trial's design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses could potentially result in data acceptable for FDA review towards approval for the proposed indication. The proposed Phase 3 clinical trial has been designed as an adequate and well-controlled non-inferiority trial comparing LPCN 1107 with Makena®, the current standard of care for PTB. Based on prior interactions with the FDA, Lipocine has proposed an efficacy endpoint focusing on the rate of delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation. Success on this gestational age endpoint could lead to Subpart H approval by the FDA. The proposed enrollment population is singleton pregnant women with a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. The proposed trial has an adaptive design with an interim analysis. LPCN 1107 is a novel oral product candidate in development for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth in women with singleton pregnancy. Potential benefits of Lipocine's oral product candidate relative to current injectable products include: the elimination of pain and site reactions associated with weekly injections, elimination of weekly doctor visits or visits from the nurse, and elimination of interference/disruption of personal, family or professional activities associated with weekly visits. LPCN 1107 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA.


Lipocine Inc. Announces Results from Both the Dosing Validation and the Dosing Flexibility Studies
Jun 19 17
Lipocine Inc. announced results from both the Dosing Validation (“DV”) and the Dosing Flexibility (“DF”) studies evaluating efficacy and tolerability of LPCN 1021. LPCN 1021 is an oral testosterone product candidate for testosterone replacement therapy (“TRT”) in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. The results from these studies confirm the validity of a fixed dose approach without the need for dose titration to orally administering LPCN 1021. LPCN 1021 successfully met the FDA primary efficacy guidelines in the DV study where 81% of the subjects achieved average testosterone levels (“Cavg”) within the normal range with a lower bound confidence interval (“CI”) of 72%. The DF study restored 70% of the subjects’ average testosterone levels within the normal range (Cavg) confirming that twice daily (“BID”) dosing is the appropriate dosing regimen for LPCN 1021 and will be the basis for resubmission. The adverse event profile of LPCN 1021 in both the DV and DF studies was consistent with the previously conducted 52-week Phase 3 Study of Androgen Replacement (“SOAR”) clinical trial. All drug related adverse events (“AEs”) were either mild or moderate in intensity and none were severe. To date, the safety database of LPCN 1021 includes 525 hypogonadal men demonstrating a profile consistent with other TRT products. The secondary endpoints assessed the maximum total testosterone concentration (“Cmax”) post dosing using predetermined limits developed by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for transdermals. Consistent with the definition of Cmax and the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple times a day dosing, two pre-specified analyses were performed, Cmax per dose and Cmax per day. In the DV study Cmax per dose analysis, the percentage of subjects with Cmax less than 1500 ng/dL and between 1800 ng/dL and 2500 ng/dL were 85% and 7%, respectively. Deviations from the predetermined limits in the DV study were observed in the Cmax per day dose analysis for these thresholds. Only one subject, who was a major protocol violator, exceeded the 2500 ng/dL limit independent of per dose or per day dose analyses. The DF study met all Cmax thresholds in per dose and per day dose analyses.

Profile

Lipocine (LPCN)
    Lipocine Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing innovative
    pharmaceutical products for use in men's and women's health using its
    proprietary drug delivery technologies. 

    Lipocine�s clinical development pipeline includes three development
    programs LPCN 1021, LPCN 1111 and LPCN 1107.  LPCN 1021, a novel oral
    prodrug of testosterone containing testosterone undecanoate, is designed to
    help restore normal testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. LPCN 1021 was
    well tolerated and met the primary efficacy end-points in Phase 3 testing
    with twice daily dosing.  LPCN 1111, a novel oral prodrug of
    testosterone, originated and is being developed by Lipocine as a
    next-generation oral testosterone product with potential for once-daily
    dosing and is currently in Phase 2 testing.  LPCN 1107, the potentially
    first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate product candidate indicated for the
    prevention of recurrent preterm birth, has been granted orphan drug
    designation by the FDA. An End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA has been
    completed.

LPCN
    1021
LPCN
    1021 is an oral testosterone replacement therapy product candidate
    containing Testosterone Undecanoate that is designed to help restore normal
    testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. Lipocine expects LPCN 1021 will help
    fulfill an unmet need in the treatment of hypogonadism. The current
    testosterone market primarily uses short-acting injectable products as well
    as topical products that carry an FDA "black box" warning related
    to inadvertent transfer of testosterone to others. Per the IMS Health
    database, an average of 540,000 prescriptions a month have been dispensed
    from January 2016 through December 2016 for testosterone products.
LPCN
    1111
LPCN
    1111 is a novel ester prodrug of testosterone which uses the Lip'ral
    technology to enhance solubility and improve systemic absorption. A Phase 1
    single dose randomized, open label, crossover study in postmenopausal women
    has been completed and the pharmacokinetics suggested feasibility of
    once-daily dosing. Further, a Phase 2a study established once-daily dosing
    potential in hypogonadal men.

    1107 is an oral product candidate of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate
    under development for the indication of prevention of recurrent preterm
    birth. LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral HPC product for
    the prevention of preterm birth in women with a prior history of at least
    one preterm birth. Potential benefits of our oral product candidate relative
    to current injectable products include the elimination of pain and site
    reactions associated with weekly injections, elimination of weekly doctor
    visits or visits from the nurse, and elimination of interference/disruption
    of personal, family or professional activities associated with weekly
    visits.
