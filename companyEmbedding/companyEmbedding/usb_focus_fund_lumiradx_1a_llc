	[            ] SHARES




	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST



	 



	 



	The Bitcoin
	Investment Trust (the Trust) issues Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (the Shares), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The Trusts purpose is to hold bitcoins,
	which are a digital commodity based on the cryptographic protocols used by the decentralized, peer-to-peer bitcoin computer network. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as
	represented by the Index (as defined herein), less the Trusts liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin. Grayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor of
	the Trust (the Sponsor), Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee), The Bank of New York Mellon is the transfer agent of the Trust (in such capacity, the Transfer Agent) and the
	administrator of the Trust (in such capacity, the Administrator) and Xapo Inc. is the custodian of the Trust (the Custodian).


	This is an initial public offering of the Trusts Shares. The Trust is offering
	[            ] of the Shares in this offering. Certain selling shareholders are offering an additional [            ] Shares.
	Consistent with its past practice, the Trust intends to issue Shares on a continuous basis after this offering.


	The Shares may be
	purchased from the Trust only in one or more blocks of 100 Shares (a block of 100 Shares is called a Basket). The Trust issues Baskets of Shares to certain authorized participants (Authorized Participants) on an ongoing basis
	as described in Plan of Distribution. Baskets are offered continuously in exchange for bitcoins. The Trust does not issue fractions of a Basket. Subject to obtaining exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(SEC) to reinstate its redemption program, the Trust intends to redeem Shares in Baskets on an ongoing basis from Authorized Participants. See Description of the SharesRedemption of the Shares.


	The Trust intends to list the Shares on NYSE Arca, Inc. (NYSE Arca) under the symbol GBTC.



	Investing in the Shares involves significant risks. See 

	Risk Factors

	 starting on page 9. Neither the
	Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities offered in this prospectus, or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a
	criminal offense.



	The Shares are neither interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor or the Trustee.


	Prior to this offering, Shares were distributed by Genesis Global Trading Inc. (Genesis), acting as the initial purchaser and sole
	Authorized Participant, through sales in private placement transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) pursuant to Rule 506(c) thereunder. After this offering,
	Shares will be distributed by Authorized Participants. Genesis will not act as an Authorized Participant in connection with the public offering of the Shares. It is expected that the Shares will be sold to the public at varying prices to be
	determined by reference to, among other considerations, the price of the bitcoins represented by each Share and the trading price of the Shares on NYSE Arca at the time of each sale. Shares registered hereby are of the same class and will have the
	same rights as the Shares distributed prior to this offering.


	The U.S. Dollar value of a Basket of Shares is equal to the Basket
	Bitcoin Amount, which is the number of bitcoins required to create or redeem a Basket of Shares, multiplied by the Bitcoin Index Price (as defined herein) on the trade date of a creation or redemption order. The Basket Bitcoin Amount is determined
	by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation or redemption order, as adjusted for the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of
	the Trust, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time (the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred millionth of one bitcoin), and multiplying such quotient by 100. As of the date of this prospectus, each Share represents
	approximately 0.093 of a bitcoin.


	Although the Trust will issue Baskets of Shares only in exchange for a deposit of bitcoins, orders to
	create and redeem Shares may be made in cash through the participation of a Liquidity Provider (as defined herein), as well as in kind, as described in Description of Creation and Redemption of Shares. The trade date on which the Basket
	Bitcoin Amount is determined is different for in-kind and in-cash orders. For in-kind orders, the trade date is the day on which an order is placed, whereas the trade date for in-cash orders is the day after which an order is placed. This could
	result in different execution prices for in-kind and in-cash orders. In addition, Authorized Participants that create shares in-cash must pay a 1% Liquidity Provider Fee (as defined herein) that is not applicable to in-kind orders, which will also
	result in different execution prices for in-kind and in-cash orders.


	The Authorized Participants will not receive a selling
	commission or discount from the Trust for the distribution of Shares to the public through sale on NYSE Arca. Purchasers of Shares may be subject to customary brokerage charges. Investors should review the terms of their brokerage accounts for
	details on applicable charges. The Authorized Participants may receive commissions or fees from investors who purchase Shares offered hereby through their commission and fee-based brokerage accounts.

	Table of Contents




	Industry and Market Data



	Although we are responsible for all disclosure contained in this prospectus, in some cases we have relied on certain market and industry data
	obtained from third-party sources that we believe to be reliable. Market estimates are calculated by using independent industry publications in conjunction with our assumptions regarding the bitcoin industry and market. While we are not aware of any
	misstatements regarding any market, industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the headings Statement Regarding
	Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this prospectus.


	 


	ii







	Table of Contents









	STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements with respect to the Trusts financial conditions, results of operations,
	plans, objectives, future performance and business. Statements preceded by, followed by or that include words such as may, might, will, should, expect, plan,
	anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue, the negative of these terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify some of the forward-looking
	statements. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this prospectus that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as changes in market prices and
	conditions, the Trusts operations, the Sponsors plans and references to the Trusts future success and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ
	materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the
	circumstances. You should specifically consider the numerous risks outlined under Risk Factors. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsors expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a
	number of risks and uncertainties, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the special considerations discussed in this prospectus;




	 




	 


	


	 


	general economic, market and business conditions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the use of technology by us and our vendors, including the Custodian, in conducting our business, including disruptions in our computer systems and data centers and our transition to, and quality of, new technology
	platforms;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the costs and effect of any litigation or regulatory investigations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our ability to maintain a positive reputation; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	other world economic and political developments.




	Consequently, all the forward-looking
	statements made in this prospectus are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result
	in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the Trusts operations or the value of the Shares. Should one or more of these risks discussed in Risk Factors or other uncertainties materialize, or should
	underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on the Sponsors beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the
	statements are made and neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty or undertakes an obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, other than as required by
	applicable laws. Moreover, neither the Trust, the Sponsor, nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned against placing undue reliance on
	forward-looking statements.

	CALCULATION OF NAV, BITCOIN INDEX PRICE AND BITCOIN HOLDINGS



	Bitcoins are held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust and are carried, for financial statement purposes, at fair value, as required by the
	U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Trust determines the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by the bitcoin exchange that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on
	the valuation date. The net asset value of the Trust determined on a GAAP basis is referred to in this prospectus as NAV.


	To
	determine which exchange is the Trusts principal market for purposes of calculating the Trusts NAV, the Trust considers only Bitcoin Exchanges that are U.S. Dollar-denominated, have an online platform and publish transaction price and
	volume data publicly. Based on these requirements, the Trust prepares a list of eligible Bitcoin Exchanges and considers the following criteria to select its principal market: (i) the volume of bitcoin traded on a Bitcoin Exchange in the prior
	twelve months, (ii) a Bitcoin Exchanges regulatory compliance with applicable federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding anti-money laundering procedures and (iii) the degree of intra-day price fluctuations a Bitcoin
	Exchange experiences, as well as the degree of variance in prices across Bitcoin Exchanges.


	In determining which of the eligible Bitcoin
	Exchanges is the Trusts principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order:


	 




	 


	


	 


	First, the Trust sorts the list of eligible Bitcoin Exchanges from high to low by volume of bitcoin traded on each Bitcoin Exchanges in the prior twelve months. The Trust moves down the list until it reaches a Bitcoin
	Exchange that has a volume of bitcoin traded for the prior twelve months that is less than 10% of the next largest Bitcoin Exchange and excludes this and all smaller Bitcoin Exchanges from the list. However, the list will always contain a minimum of
	three Bitcoin Exchanges, even if the percentage of volume drops to less than 10% of the next largest Bitcoin Exchange.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Second, the Trust reviews the remaining Bitcoin Exchanges and excludes any Bitcoin Exchanges that do not comply with the federal and state licensing requirements that are applicable to the Trust and the Authorized
	Participants. The Trust, Authorized Participants or Liquidity Providers can only do business with those Bitcoin Exchanges that meet the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the Trust or an Authorized Participants or Liquidity
	Providers are registered to do business. For example, the Trust is registered to do business in New York and thus can only do business with Bitcoin Exchanges that have applied for a BitLicense as required by New York law. If an Authorized
	Participant or Liquidity Provider, however, is registered in a different jurisdiction, such Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider, and by extension the Trust, could do business with any Bitcoin Exchange that meets the regulatory requirements
	of that jurisdiction, even if they do not meet the regulatory requirements in New York. The Trust also assesses each Bitcoin Exchanges practices regarding anti-money laundering procedures.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Third, the Trust then reviews intra-day pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Bitcoin Exchanges to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a
	particular Bitcoin Exchange. The Trust then selects a Bitcoin Exchange as its principal market based on highest trade volume and price stability in comparison to the other Bitcoin Exchanges on the list.




	The Trust determines its principal market annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine if (i) there have been recent changes to
	each Bitcoin Exchanges transaction volume in the prior twelve months, (ii) if any Bitcoin Exchanges have fallen out of, or come into, compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, (iii) if the Trust has engaged any new Authorized
	Participant or Liquidity Provider that, due to being registered to do business in another jurisdiction, would make Bitcoin Exchanges previously inaccessible to the Trust now accessible or (iv) if recent changes to each Bitcoin Exchanges price
	stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trusts determination of its principal market.


	 


	iv







	Table of Contents



	Intra-day price fluctuations across the exchanges are relatively immaterial and the variance of
	prices on Bitcoin Exchanges with the highest transaction volumes is rarely greater than 1%. These variances usually stem from small changes in the fee structures on different Bitcoin Exchanges or differences in administrative procedures required to
	deposit and withdraw fiat currency in exchange for bitcoins and vice versa. The greatest variances are found at (i) smaller exchanges with relatively low transaction volumes where even small trades can be large relative to an exchanges
	transaction volume and as a result impact the trading price on those exchanges, (ii) exchanges that are inaccessible to the Trust because they do not meet the Trusts regulatory requirements or (iii) exchanges that lack adequate compliance
	controls, such as know-your-customer procedures, and as a result are accessed and used by a captured market or by parties that do not have regulatory or compliance requirements. Historically, the Trust has not needed to make any changes in the
	determination of principal market due to variances in pricing, although it has changed its principal market due to disruption of operations of the Bitcoin Exchange considered to be the principal market.


	Historically, the Trust considered Bitstamp to be its principal market, with an exception for the period of January 5, 2015 through January
	31, 2015, when the Trust relied on pricing from Bitfinex. On January 5, 2015 Bitstamp suffered a disruption of operations, and in accordance with the Trusts procedures for determining its principal market, the Trust relied upon Bitfinex until
	January 31, 2015, when the Trust determined that it could again rely upon Bitstamp as the principal market. The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at December 31, 2016, in accordance with its accounting policies, and identified a
	change in the principal market from Bitstamp to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX) (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange). The Trust has applied this change in principal market effective December 31, 2016 and has valued bitcoin held by
	the Trust since December 31, 2016 using the GDAX exchange.


	The Trusts investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the
	performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index, less the Trusts liabilities and expenses. Accordingly, the Trusts aggregate and per Share value is tracked by reference to the Bitcoin Index Price, which is
	the price of a bitcoin derived from multiple Bitcoin Exchanges that are reflected in the Index. The Trust believes that calculating the Bitcoin Index Price in this manner mitigates the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading that may occur on
	any single Bitcoin Exchange. See Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and MarketBitcoin ValueThe Index and the Bitcoin Index Price. The Trust uses the Bitcoin Index Price to calculate its Bitcoin Holdings, which is
	the aggregate U.S. Dollar value of bitcoins in the Trust, based on the Bitcoin Index Price, less its liabilities and expenses. Bitcoin Holdings per Share is calculated by dividing Bitcoin Holdings by the number of Shares currently
	outstanding. Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Bitcoin Holdings is not intended to be a substitute for the Trusts NAV calculated in accordance with GAAP, and Bitcoin Holdings
	per Share is not intended to be a substitute for the Trusts NAV per Share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY




	This is only a summary of the prospectus and, while it contains material information about the Trust and its Shares, it does not contain or
	summarize all of the information about the Trust and the Shares contained in this prospectus which is material and/or which may be important to you. You should read this entire prospectus, including Risk Factors beginning on page 9,
	before making an investment decision about the Shares.




	Trust Overview



	The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as


	represented by the Index, less the Trusts liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way
	to invest in bitcoin. Because the value of the Shares is tied to the value of the bitcoins held by the Trust, it is important to first understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, bitcoins. Investing in the Shares does not insulate
	the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. See Risk Factors.


	Bitcoins are a digital commodity based on an
	open source protocol. Bitcoins are not issued by any government, bank or central organization, and instead exist on an online, peer-to-peer computer network (the Bitcoin Network) that hosts a public transaction ledger where bitcoin
	transfers are recorded (the Blockchain). The Bitcoin Network is accessed through software, and software governs bitcoin creation, movement and ownership.


	Bitcoins have no physical existence beyond the record of transactions on the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a public record of the creation,
	custody and flow of funds of bitcoins, showing every transaction effected on the Blockchain among users online digital wallets where their bitcoins are effectively stored. Bitcoins may be sent or received through users
	digital wallets by using public and private keys that are part of the Bitcoin Networks cryptographic security mechanism.


	The
	Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and are expected to be traded under the ticker symbol GBTC on NYSE Arca. The Trust issues Baskets of Shares to Authorized Participants on an
	ongoing basis in exchange for bitcoins that are deposited for safekeeping with the Custodian (as defined below). Subject to obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC, the Trust will distribute bitcoins by redeeming Shares in Baskets on an ongoing
	basis from Authorized Participants. See Description of the SharesRedemption of the Shares.



	Trust Structure



	The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust, organized on September 13, 2013, that operates pursuant to a trust agreement between the Sponsor
	and the Trustee (the Trust Agreement), authorizing the Sponsor to enter into a custody agreement (the Custodian Agreement) with Xapo Inc. (the Custodian). Pursuant to the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian
	establishes accounts that hold the bitcoins deposited with the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.


	The Trusts Sponsor is Grayscale
	Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor, Digital Currency Group, Inc., the sole
	member of the Sponsor, is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor.


	The Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust and is arranging for the registration of the Shares for their public offering in the United
	States and their listing on NYSE Arca. The Sponsor is obligated to assume and pay

	Table of Contents





	the following fees and expenses of the Trust: the Trustees fee payable under the Trust Agreement, the Custodian Fee (as defined herein), the Transfer Agent Fee (as defined herein), the
	Marketing Fee (as defined herein), applicable license fees, including the licensing fees related to the Index License Agreement (as defined herein), the Administrator Fee (as defined herein), fees and expenses related to trading of Shares on NYSE
	Arca (including marketing, legal and audit fees and expenses), legal expenses, audit fees, regulatory fees, including any fees relating to the registration of the Shares with the SEC, printing and mailing costs and costs of maintaining the
	Trusts website. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trusts organization.


	The Sponsor and the Administrator are
	generally responsible for the administration of the Trust under the provisions of the Trust Agreement. The responsibilities of the Sponsor include (i) selecting and monitoring the Trusts Service Providers (as defined herein) and from time to
	time engaging additional, successor or replacement Service Providers and (ii) upon dissolution of the Trust, distributing the Trusts remaining bitcoins or the cash proceeds of the sale of the Trusts remaining bitcoins (determined at the
	sole discretion of the Sponsor) to the owners of record of the Shares. The responsibilities of the Administrator include (i) preparing and providing periodic reports on behalf of the Trust to investors, (ii) processing orders to create and redeem
	Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian, the Transfer Agent and The Depository Trust Company (DTC), (iii) publishing the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share (each as defined
	herein) each business day at 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable and (iv) instructing the Custodian to transfer the Trusts bitcoins, as needed to pay the Sponsors Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses (each as
	defined herein).


	Although the Trusts bitcoins are not stored in a physical sense, a record of the Trusts bitcoins are
	identifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain via digital addresses established by the Custodian. These digital addresses are contained in a Wallet Account and a Vault Account (each as defined herein) which together constitute the Bitcoin
	Account. The Bitcoin Account consists of multi-signature digital addresses, which require several distinct private keys to authenticate access to and transfer of the Trusts bitcoins from the Bitcoin Account. Notwithstanding
	bitcoins payable to the Sponsor for its management fee or bitcoins deposited into or removed from the Trust in connection with the creation or redemption of Baskets, respectively, the Sponsor endeavors to instruct the Custodian to maintain all of
	the Trusts bitcoins within a Vault Account. All of the private keys for the Trusts Vault Account are kept in cold storage, which means that the bitcoins held in the Trusts Vault Account are not directly connected to, or
	accessible from, the internet or other networks without the private keys. The Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trusts private keys used to access the Bitcoin Account and facilitates the transfer of bitcoins in accordance
	with the Sponsors instructions.


	The general role, responsibilities and regulation of the Sponsor, Trustee, Administrator and
	Custodian are further described in The Sponsor, The Trustee, The Administrator and The Custodian, respectively. Detailed descriptions of certain specific rights and duties of the Sponsor, Trustee,
	Administrator and Custodian are set forth in Description of the Trust DocumentsDescription of the Trust Agreement and Description of the Custodian Agreement, respectively. The Trust Agreement and Custodian
	Agreement are collectively referred to herein as Trust Documents.



	Bitcoin History



	The Bitcoin Network is a recent technological innovation, and the bitcoins that are created, transferred, used and stored by entities and
	individuals have certain features associated with several types of assets, most notably commodities and currencies. Many U.S. regulators, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (FinCEN),
	the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and state regulators, including the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), have made official pronouncements or
	issued guidance or rules regarding the treatment of bitcoins and other digital currencies. However, other U.S. and state agencies, such as the SEC, have not made official pronouncements or issued guidance or rules regarding the treatment of
	bitcoins. Similarly, the treatment of bitcoins and other digital currencies is often uncertain or contradictory in other countries. The regulatory

	Table of Contents





	uncertainty surrounding the treatment of bitcoins creates risks for the Trust and its Shares. See Risk FactorsRisk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares.


	Some of the notable features of the Trust and its Shares include the holding of bitcoins in the Trusts own accounts, the experience
	of the Sponsors management team in the Bitcoin industry and the use of the Custodian to protect the Trusts private keys. See Activities of the Trust.



	Emerging Growth Company Status



	The Trust
	is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). For as long as the Trust is an emerging growth company, unlike other public companies, it will not be required to,
	among other things:


	 




	 


	


	 


	provide an auditors attestation report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
	2002; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise.




	The Trust will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of (i) it having $1.0 billion or more in annual
	revenues, (ii) at least $700 million in market value of Shares being held by non-affiliates, (iii) it issuing more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following
	the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering.


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth
	company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
	certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies; however, the Trust is choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, the Trust will comply with new or revised
	accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Trusts decision to opt out of the extended transition period for
	complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.



	Principal Offices



	The Trustees principal office is located at 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19808. The Sponsors principal office is
	located at 636 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10011 and its telephone number is (212) 668-5920. The Custodians principal office is located at 2983 Woodside Road, Woodside, California 94062.

	Bitcoin Index Price



	For purposes of determining the number of bitcoins required to create and redeem Baskets, the Trust uses the TradeBlock XBX Index (the Index) to calculate a volume-weighted per-bitcoin value in U.S. Dollars (the Bitcoin Index
	Price). The Bitcoin Index Price is calculated by applying a weighting algorithm to the price and volume of all bitcoin data from selected trading venues for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the
	valuation date. The Bitcoin Index Price is calculated using a non-GAAP methodology and is not used in the Trusts financial statements included in this prospectus.





	 




	 


	The Index is a U.S. Dollar-denominated composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin based on the volume-weighted price at trading venues selected by TradeBlock, Inc. (the Index Provider). To ensure that
	the Index Providers trading venue selection process is impartial, the Index Provider considers depth of liquidity, compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, data availability, U.S. domicile and acceptance of U.S. Dollar
	deposits.




	In the calculation of the Bitcoin Index Price, the Index Provider cleanses the trade data and compiles it in
	such a manner as to algorithmically reduce the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading. This is accomplished by adjusting the weight of each input based on price deviation relative to the observable set of data for the relevant trading venue,
	as well as recent and long-term trading volume at each venue relative to the observable set for the relevant trading venues.


	 






	 


	4







	Table of Contents





	The Index Provider formally reevaluates the weighting algorithm quarterly, but maintains
	discretion to change the way in which the Index is calculated based on its periodic review or in extreme circumstances. While the Index does not currently utilize data from over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms, the Index Provider may
	decide to include pricing data from such markets or platforms in the future, which could include data from Genesis, a Liquidity Provider and affiliate of the Trust.


	 




	 


	Index rate data and the description of the Index are based on information publicly available at the Index Providers website at https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/.


	None of the information on the Index
	Providers website is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.






	 




	 


	If the Index becomes unavailable, or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin value then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Index Provider to obtain
	the Bitcoin Index Price directly from the Index Provider. If after such contact the Index remains unavailable or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price, then the Administrator will
	employ a cascading set of rules, as described in Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and MarketBitcoin ValueThe Index and the Bitcoin Index Price to determine the Bitcoin Index Price.




	 







	CUSIP







	 





	Creation and Redemption



	The Trust issues Shares on an ongoing basis, but only in one or more whole Baskets. Subject to obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC to reinstate its redemption program, the Trust intends to redeem Shares in Baskets on an ongoing basis from
	Authorized Participants. See Risk FactorsRisk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the SharesThe Trust and an affiliate of the Trust recently entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC concerning the operation
	of the Trusts former redemption program and Description of the SharesRedemption of the Shares.





	A Basket equals 100 Shares. As of the date of this prospectus, each Share represents approximately 0.093 of a bitcoin. See Description
	of Creation and Redemption of Shares.


	 




	 



	The creation and redemption of Baskets require the delivery to the Trust, or the distribution by the Trust, of the number of
	bitcoins represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the number of which is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation or redemption order, as adjusted for
	the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time (the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one bitcoin), and
	multiplying such quotient by 100 (the Basket Bitcoin Amount). The number of bitcoins required to create a Basket, or to be delivered





	 






	 


	5







	Table of Contents







	 



	upon the redemption of a Basket, will gradually decrease over time due to the transfer of the Trusts bitcoins to pay the Sponsors Fee and the delivery or sale of the Trusts
	bitcoins to pay any Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trust will not accept or distribute cash in exchange for Baskets, other than upon its dissolution. See Description of Creation and Redemption of Shares and
	Activities of the TrustTrust Expenses.





	 


	Although the Trust will create Baskets only upon the receipt of bitcoins, and will redeem Baskets only by distributing bitcoins, an Authorized
	Participant may deposit cash with the Administrator, which will facilitate the purchase or sale of bitcoins through a Liquidity Provider on behalf of an Authorized Participant (the Conversion Procedures). See Description of
	Creation and Redemption of Shares.


	 







	The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings



	The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings is the aggregate U.S. Dollar value of the Trusts bitcoins less its liabilities (which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses), as calculated using the Bitcoin Index Price. The
	Administrator calculates the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings on a daily basis. See Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market for a description of the Index and the operation of the Bitcoin Exchange Market from which prices are used to
	determine the Bitcoin Index Price.





	 




	 


	The Administrator also calculates the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share, which equals the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings divided by the number of Shares then outstanding. The Sponsor will publish the Trusts
	Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share each business day as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable at the Trusts website at https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-investment-trust/#market-performance. See
	Valuation of Bitcoins and Definition of the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings for a more detailed description of the methods used to calculate the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share.




	 




	 


	As of April 28, 2017, the Bitcoin Holdings per Share, which is equal to the price of a Share, was $124.48.




	 







	Trust expenses



	The Trusts only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsors Fee). The Sponsors Fee will be determined by applying a 2% annual rate to the Trusts Bitcoin
	Holdings, and converting the resulting U.S. Dollar amount into bitcoins at the Bitcoin Index Price, on a daily basis. The Sponsors Fee will be payable in bitcoins at such times as determined in the Sponsors sole discretion. Payments of
	the Sponsors Fee will occur monthly in arrears.





	To pay the Sponsors Fee, the Custodian will, when directed by
	the Sponsor, (i) withdraw from the Bitcoin Account the number of bitcoins equal to the accrued but unpaid Sponsors Fee, determined as


	 






	 


	6







	Table of Contents





	described above, and (ii) transfer such bitcoins to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor. The Sponsor, from time to time, may waive all or a portion of the Sponsors Fee in
	its discretion for stated periods of time. The Sponsor is under no obligation to extend a waiver after the end of any such stated period, and, if such waiver is not continued, the Sponsors Fee will be paid in full for subsequent periods.
	Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of the Sponsors Fee. The Sponsor will, from time to time, instruct the Custodian to deliver bitcoins to the Sponsors account in payment of the Sponsors Fee.


	 




	 


	As consideration for its receipt of the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor is obligated to assume and pay the following fees and expenses of the Trust: the Marketing Fee, the Administrator Fee, the Custodian Fee, the
	Transfer Agent Fee, the Trustee fee, applicable license fees, including the licensing fees related to the Index License Agreement, fees and expenses related to trading of Shares on NYSE Arca (including marketing, legal and audit fees and expenses),
	legal expenses, audit fees, regulatory fees, including any fees relating to the registration of the Shares with the SEC, printing and mailing costs and costs of maintaining the Trusts website (the Sponsor-paid Expenses).




	 




	 


	The Trust may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses and indemnification expenses that are not contractually assumed by the Sponsor (collectively, Additional Trust Expenses). See
	Expenses. In such circumstances, the Sponsor will cause the Custodian to convert bitcoins into U.S. Dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate (as defined herein), in such quantity as may be necessary to pay such
	Additional Trust Expenses.




	 




	 


	The number of bitcoins to be delivered to the Sponsor in payment of the Sponsors Fee or sold to pay Additional Trust Expenses will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trusts expenses and the
	value of bitcoins, as determined using the Bitcoin Index Price or the Actual Exchange Rate, as applicable. See Activities of the TrustTrust Expenses. Assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, each delivery or sale of bitcoins by the Trust for the payment of the Sponsors Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses will be a taxable event for Shareholders. See U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesTax Consequences to
	U.S. Holders.




	 







	Termination events



	Upon dissolution of the Trust and surrender of Shares by the Shareholders, Shareholders will receive a distribution in U.S. Dollars or in bitcoins, at the sole discretion of the Sponsor, after the Sponsor has paid or made provision for the
	Trusts obligations. See Description of the Trust DocumentsDescription of the Trust AgreementThe TrusteeTermination of the Trust.

	Authorized Participants

	RISK FACTORS




	You should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other
	information included in this prospectus, including the Trusts financial statements and related notes thereto.







	Risk Factors Related to the
	Bitcoin Network and Bitcoins





	The loss or destruction of a private key required to access a bitcoin may be irreversible. The
	Trusts loss of access to its private keys or its experience of a data loss relating to the Trusts bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	Bitcoins are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in
	which the bitcoins are held. While the Bitcoin Network requires a public key relating to a digital wallet to be published when used in a spending transaction, private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from
	accessing the bitcoins held in such wallet. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the Trust will be unable to access the bitcoins held in the related digital wallet
	and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the Bitcoin Network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store the Trusts bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The further development and acceptance of the Bitcoin Network and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance
	of transactions in bitcoins and other digital currencies, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of the
	Bitcoin Network may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The use of digital currencies such as bitcoins to, among other
	things, buy and sell goods and services, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs digital assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Bitcoin is a prominent, but not a unique part of this
	industry. The growth of this industry in general, and the Bitcoin Network in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of this industry, include, but are not limited to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital currencies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	government and quasi-government regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the Bitcoin Network or similar digital asset systems;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Bitcoin Network;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	negative consumer perception of bitcoins specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.




	The
	Trust is not actively managed and will not have any strategy relating to the development of the Bitcoin Network. Furthermore, the Sponsor cannot be certain as to the impact of the listing of the Shares and the expansion of its bitcoin holdings on
	the digital asset industry and the Bitcoin Network. A decline in the popularity or acceptance of the Bitcoin Network would harm the price of the Shares.

	Currently, there is relatively small use of bitcoins in the retail and commercial
	marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	Bitcoins and the Bitcoin Network have only recently become accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by certain major retail and
	commercial outlets, and use of bitcoins by consumers to pay such retail and commercial outlets remains limited. Conversely, a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or
	long-term holding of bitcoins. A lack of expansion by bitcoins into retail and commercial markets, or a contraction of such use, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the Bitcoin Index Price, either of which could adversely affect an
	investment in the Shares.




	The Core Developers or other programmers could propose amendments to the Bitcoin Networks protocols
	and software that, if accepted and authorized by the Bitcoin Network community, could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The Bitcoin Network uses a cryptographic protocol to govern the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to the Bitcoin Network.
	The code that sets forth the protocol is informally managed by a development team known as the Core Developers that was initially appointed informally by the Bitcoin Networks purported creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The members of the Core
	Developers evolve over time, largely based on self-determined participation in the resource section dedicated to Bitcoin on Github.com. The Core Developers can propose amendments to the Bitcoin Networks source code through software upgrades
	that alter the protocols and software of the Bitcoin Network and the properties of bitcoins, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoins. Proposals for upgrades and related discussions take place on
	online forums including GitHub.com and Bitcointalk.org. To the extent that a significant majority of the users and miners on the Bitcoin Network install such software upgrade(s), the Bitcoin Network would be subject to new protocols and software
	that may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the
	processing power on the Bitcoin Network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Blockchain to adversely affect an investment in the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate.




	If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the
	computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on the Bitcoin Network, it may be able to alter the Blockchain on which the Bitcoin Network and most bitcoin transactions rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing
	certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new bitcoins or transactions using such control. The
	malicious actor could double-spend its own bitcoins (i.e., spend the same bitcoins in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users transactions for so long as it maintained control. To the extent that such
	malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network or the bitcoin community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the Blockchain may not be possible.


	Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of the Blockchain achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing
	power on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin
	transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem, including the Core Developers and the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor
	obtaining control of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network will increase, which may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.

	If the award of bitcoins for solving blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions
	are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, miners may cease expending processing power to solve blocks and confirmations of transactions on the Blockchain could be slowed temporarily. A reduction in the processing power expended by miners on
	the Bitcoin Network could increase the likelihood of a malicious actor or botnet obtaining control.




	If the award of new bitcoins
	for solving blocks declines and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, miners may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease their mining operations. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on
	the Bitcoin Network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions (i.e., temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to the Blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions)
	and make the Bitcoin Network more vulnerable to a malicious actor or botnet obtaining control in excess of 50% of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network, which would allow such actor or botnet to manipulate the Blockchain and hinder
	transactions. Any reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or processing power of the Bitcoin Network may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	If fees increase for recording transactions in the Blockchain, demand for bitcoins may be reduced and prevent the expansion of the
	Bitcoin Network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	As the number of bitcoins awarded for solving a block in the Blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to contribute processing power to
	the Bitcoin Network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to the Bitcoin Network, the Bitcoin Network may either formally or informally transition from a set
	reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block. If miners demand higher transaction fees to recording transactions in the Blockchain or a software upgrade automatically charges fees for all transactions, the cost of using bitcoins may
	increase and the marketplace may be reluctant to accept bitcoins as a means of payment. Existing users may be motivated to switch from bitcoins to another digital currency or back to fiat currency. Decreased use and demand for bitcoins may adversely
	affect their value and result in a reduction in the Bitcoin Index Price and the price of the Shares.




	To the extent that the profit
	margins of Bitcoin mining operations are not high, Bitcoin miners are more likely to immediately sell bitcoins earned by mining in the Bitcoin Exchange Market, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely affect an
	investment in the Shares.




	Over the past several years, Bitcoin Network mining operations have evolved from individual users mining
	with computer processors, graphics processing units and first generation ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) machines. Currently, new processing power brought onto the Bitcoin Network is predominantly added by incorporated and
	unincorporated professionalized mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the investment of significant capital for
	the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining
	operations are of a greater scale than prior Bitcoin Network miners and have more defined, regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to more immediately sell bitcoins earned
	from mining operations on the Bitcoin exchange market (Bitcoin Exchange Market), whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoins for more extended periods. The immediate selling
	of newly mined bitcoins would increase the supply of bitcoins on the Bitcoin Exchange Market, creating downward pressure on the price of bitcoins.


	The extent to which the value of bitcoins mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs
	determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined bitcoins rapidly if it is operating at a


	 


	11







	Table of Contents



	low profit margin, and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage of the 1,600 to 2,000 new bitcoins
	mined each day will be sold into the Bitcoin Exchange Market more rapidly, thereby reducing bitcoin prices. Further, in July 2016, the reward for mining bitcoins was reduced from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins, thereby further reducing the profit
	margin. Lower bitcoin prices will result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for professionalized mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of
	bitcoins until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power from the Bitcoin Network. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined bitcoins could result in a
	reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	To the extent that any miners cease to
	record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the Blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Any widespread
	delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in the Bitcoin Network, which could adversely impact an investment in the Shares.




	To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the Blockchain until a
	block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the recording of transactions in solved blocks. However, to the extent that any such incentives
	arise (for example, a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing Bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for, or in addition to, the award of new bitcoins upon the solving of a block), miners could delay the
	recording and confirmation of a significant number of transactions on the Blockchain. If such delays became systemic, it could result in greater exposure to double-spending transactions and a loss of confidence in the Bitcoin Network, which could
	adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The acceptance of Bitcoin Network software patches or upgrades by a significant, but
	not overwhelming, percentage of the users and miners in the Bitcoin Network could result in a fork in the Blockchain, resulting in the operation of two separate networks.




	There is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the Bitcoin Network. Any individual can download the Bitcoin
	Network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the Bitcoin Network through software downloads and upgrades, typically posted to the Bitcoin development forum on GitHub.com. A substantial majority of
	miners and Bitcoin users must consent to such software modifications by downloading the altered software or upgrade; otherwise, the modifications do not become a part of the Bitcoin Network. Since the Bitcoin Networks inception, modifications
	to the Bitcoin Network have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the Bitcoin Network remains a coherent economic system.


	If, however, a proposed modification is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users, but is nonetheless accepted by a substantial
	population of participants in the Bitcoin Network, a fork in the Blockchain could develop, resulting in two separate Bitcoin Networks. Such a fork in the Blockchain typically would be addressed by community-led efforts to merge the
	forked Blockchains, and several prior forks have been so merged.


	However, if a permanent fork were to occur, there is a remote
	possibility that bitcoin would evolve into two slightly different versions. For example, in 2016, Ethereum, a digital currency, experienced a permanent fork in its blockchain that resulted in two slightly different versions of the digital currency.
	Community-led efforts to merge the blockchains were not successful and a small minority of Ethereum holders continued to support the old blockchain. This led to the development of two distinct blockchains that produced two slightly different
	versions


	 


	12







	Table of Contents



	of Ethereum: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Therefore holders of Ethereum Classic were given an equal number of the new Ethereum currency and therefore held equal numbers of Ethereum Classic and
	Ethereum when the fork became permanent.


	If a permanent fork, similar to the one which occurred with respect to Ethereum, were to occur
	with respect to bitcoin, the Trust would hold equal amounts of the original and the new bitcoin as a result. In that event, and subject to the requirement that the Trust continue to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
	the Sponsor expects that it would, (i) in consultation with the Index Provider, select a Bitcoin Network (and therefore a single version of bitcoin) and (ii) simultaneously isolate the bitcoin on the Bitcoin Network that it did not select in order
	to segregate it from the bitcoin the Trust would continue to hold. In that case, the Sponsors intention would be to distribute to its Shareholders the bitcoin on the Bitcoin Network that it did not select, with the result that the Trust would
	only hold one version of bitcoin. It is uncertain whether the value of any such distribution of the bitcoin on the Bitcoin Network that the Sponsor did not select would equal the change in the value of the Shares resulting from such distribution.
	Consequently, a permanent fork could materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares.




	Intellectual property rights claims
	may adversely affect the operation of the Bitcoin Network and could cause the termination of the Trust.




	Third parties may assert
	intellectual property rights claims relating to the operation of digital currencies and their source code relating to the holding and transfer of such assets. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened
	action that reduces confidence in the Bitcoin Networks long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer bitcoins may adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property rights
	claim could prevent the Trust and other end-users from accessing the Bitcoin Network or holding or transferring their bitcoins, which could force the Sponsor to terminate the Trust and liquidate the Trusts bitcoins (if such liquidation of the
	Trusts bitcoins is possible). As a result, an intellectual property rights claim against the Trust or other large Bitcoin Network participants could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The open-source structure of the Bitcoin Network protocol means that the Core Developers and other contributors are generally not
	directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the Bitcoin Network protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the Bitcoin Network protocol could damage the Bitcoin Network and an investment in the Shares.




	The Bitcoin Network operates based on an open-source protocol maintained by the Core Developers and other contributors, largely on
	the GitHub resource section dedicated to Bitcoin development. As the Bitcoin Network protocol is not sold and its use does not generate revenues for its development team, the Core Developers are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating
	the Bitcoin Network protocol. Consequently, there is a lack of financial incentive for developers to maintain or develop the Bitcoin Network and the Core Developers may lack the resources to adequately address emerging issues with the Bitcoin
	Network protocol. Although the Bitcoin Network is currently supported by the Core Developers, there can be no guarantee that such support will continue or be sufficient in the future. To the extent that material issues arise with the Bitcoin Network
	protocol and the Core Developers and open-source contributors are unable to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner, the Bitcoin Network and an investment in the Shares may be adversely affected.






	Risk Factors Related to the Bitcoin Exchange Market and the Index





	The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of bitcoins could
	materially and adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The Shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the
	performance of the price of bitcoins, as measured by the Index, and the value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the Trust, less the Trusts liabilities (including estimated accrued but unpaid fees and
	expenses). Using a composite

	reference rate of volume-weighted trading data, the Index is derived from the transaction prices on electronic market places where exchange participants may first use fiat currency to trade, buy
	and sell bitcoins based on bid-ask trading (a Bitcoin Exchange). The Index uses U.S. Dollar-denominated trading data from the Bitcoin Exchanges to determine the Bitcoin Index Price. Whether a Bitcoin Exchange is considered eligible to be
	included in the Indexs calculation depends on considerations such as depth of liquidity, compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, data availability, U.S. domicile and acceptance of U.S. Dollar deposits. The price of
	bitcoins has fluctuated widely over the past several years and may continue to experience significant price fluctuations. Several factors may affect the Bitcoin Index Price, including, but not limited to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Total bitcoins in existence (estimated at approximately 16.30 million as of April 28, 2017 according to www.blockchain.info);




	 




	 


	


	 


	Global bitcoin demand, which is influenced by the growth of retail merchants and commercial businesses acceptance of bitcoins as payment for goods and services, the security of online Bitcoin Exchanges and
	digital wallets that hold bitcoins, the perception that the use and holding of bitcoins is safe and secure, the lack of regulatory restrictions on their use and the reputation of bitcoins for illicit use;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Global bitcoin supply, which is influenced by similar factors as global bitcoin demand, in addition to fiat currency needs by miners (for example, to invest in equipment or pay electricity bills) and taxpayers who may
	liquidate bitcoin holdings around tax deadlines to meet tax obligations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Investors expectations with respect to the rate of deflation of bitcoin;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Interest rates;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Currency exchange rates, including the rates at which bitcoins may be exchanged for fiat currencies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of Bitcoin Exchanges and liquidity of such Bitcoin Exchanges;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Interruptions in service from or failures of major Bitcoin Exchanges;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Cyber theft of bitcoins from online bitcoin wallet providers, or news of such theft from such providers, or from individuals bitcoin wallets;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Investment and trading activities of large investors, including private and registered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in bitcoins;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Regulatory measures, if any, that restrict the use of bitcoins as a form of payment or the purchase of bitcoins on the Bitcoin Market;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The availability and popularity of businesses that provide bitcoin-related services;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Bitcoin Network;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Increased competition from other forms of cryptocurrency or payments services;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Expectations among Bitcoin economy participants that the value of bitcoins will soon change; and

	Fees associated with processing a bitcoin transaction.




	If bitcoin markets continue to be
	subject to sharp fluctuations, you may experience losses if you need to sell your Shares at a time when the price of bitcoins is lower than it was when you made your prior investment. Even if you are able to hold Shares for the long-term, your
	Shares may never generate a profit, since bitcoin markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices, in addition to sharp fluctuations.

	Table of Contents



	In addition, investors should be aware that there is no assurance that bitcoins will maintain
	their long-term value in terms of future purchasing power or that the acceptance of bitcoin payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will continue to grow. In the event that the price of bitcoins declines, the Sponsor
	expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately.




	The value of bitcoins as represented by the Bitcoin
	Index Price may be subject to momentum pricing due to speculation regarding future appreciation in value, leading to greater volatility which could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	Momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation, as determined by the investing public, accounts
	for anticipated future appreciation in value. The Bitcoin Index Price is determined using data from various Bitcoin Exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. The Sponsor believes that momentum pricing of bitcoins has resulted,
	and may continue to result, in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoins, inflating and making the Bitcoin Index Price more volatile. As a result, bitcoins may be more likely to fluctuate in value due to changing investor
	confidence in future appreciation or depreciation in the Bitcoin Index Price, which could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The Index is an average composite reference rate calculated using volume-weighted trading price data from various Bitcoin Exchanges
	chosen by the Index Provider. Pricing on any Bitcoin Exchange in the Bitcoin Exchange Market can be volatile and can adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The Index has a limited history and is an average composite reference rate that is based on volume-weighted trading price data from various
	Bitcoin Exchanges chosen by the Index Provider. The data inputs are drawn from the application programming interface of various Bitcoin Exchanges and includes trade time, price and volume. The Index Provider selects which Bitcoin Exchanges to
	include in the Index based on currency-denomination, liquidity and such other factors as the Index Provider may deem material (for example, availability of data). The Index Provider reviews the eligibility of Bitcoin Exchanges periodically, and not
	less frequently than quarterly. As of the date of this prospectus, the eligible Bitcoin Exchanges selected by the Index Provider include Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), Kraken and itBit. The calculation of the Index at 4:00
	p.m., New York time on each business day will be used as the Bitcoin Index Price for the calculation of the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings. See Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and MarketBitcoin Value.


	The price of bitcoins on public Bitcoin Exchanges has a limited history of less than seven years. During such history, bitcoin prices on the
	Bitcoin Exchange Market as a whole, and on Bitcoin Exchanges individually, have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity on Bitcoin Exchanges. Even the largest Bitcoin Exchanges have been subject to
	operational interruption, limiting the liquidity of bitcoins on the Bitcoin Exchange Market and resulting in volatile prices and a reduction in confidence in the Bitcoin Network and the Bitcoin Exchange Market. For example, both OKCoin and Bitfinex
	were previously included in the Index but have been removed due to operational difficulties. Effective February 17, 2017, OKCoin was removed due to its implementation of a policy that currently suspends withdrawals from its exchange. On April
	17, 2017, Bitfinex announced that it was having difficulty withdrawing fiat currencies from its Taiwanese banks, and as a result, it stopped accepting incoming wires, leading to volatility in the price of bitcoin on Bitfinex. On May 3, 2017, the
	Index Provider removed Bitfinex from the Index and added Kraken.


	The Index is designed to have limited exposure to Bitcoin Exchange
	interruption by utilizing transaction data from the high volume U.S. Dollar-denominated Bitcoin Exchanges, measured over the prior 24-hour period. The Index is also designed to limit exposure to trading or price distortion on Bitcoin Exchanges
	experiencing periods of unusual activity or limited liquidity by discounting, in real-time, anomalous price movement at individual exchanges. The Sponsor believes the Index calculation methodology provides a more accurate picture of bitcoin price
	movements than a simple average of Bitcoin Exchange prices, and that the inclusion of only the highest volume Bitcoin Exchanges during the calculation period limits the likelihood that included data is influenced by temporary price dislocations that
	may result from technical problems or limited liquidity on otherwise eligible exchanges. The Index Provider periodically reviews which Bitcoin Exchanges are used to

	Table of Contents



	calculate the Bitcoin Index Price using considerations such as depth of liquidity, compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, data availability, U.S. domicile and acceptance of
	U.S. Dollar deposits.


	The price of bitcoins on public Bitcoin Exchanges may also be impacted by policies on or interruptions in the
	deposit or withdrawal of fiat currency into or out of larger Bitcoin Exchanges. On large Bitcoin Exchanges, users may buy or sell bitcoins for fiat currency or transfer bitcoins to other wallets. Operational limits (including regulatory, exchange
	policy or technical or operational limits) on the size or settlement speed of fiat currency deposits by users into Bitcoin Exchanges may reduce demand on such Bitcoin Exchanges, resulting in a reduction in the bitcoin price on such Bitcoin Exchange.
	Operational limits (including regulatory, exchange policy or technical or operational limits) on the size or settlement speed of fiat currency withdrawals by users from Bitcoin Exchanges may reduce supply on such Bitcoin Exchanges, resulting in an
	increase in the bitcoin price on such Bitcoin Exchange. To the extent that fees for the transfer of bitcoins either directly or indirectly occur between Bitcoin Exchanges, the impact on bitcoin prices of operational limits on fiat currency deposits
	and withdrawals may be reduced by exchange shopping among Bitcoin Exchange users. For example, a delay in U.S. Dollar withdrawals on one site may temporarily increase the price on such site by reducing supply (i.e., sellers
	transferring bitcoins to another exchange without operational limits in order to settle sales more rapidly), but the resulting increase in price will also reduce demand because bidders on bitcoins will follow increased supply on other Bitcoin
	Exchanges not experiencing operational limits. To the extent that users are able or willing to utilize or arbitrage prices between more than one Bitcoin Exchange, exchange shopping may mitigate the short-term impact on and volatility of bitcoin
	prices due to operational limits on the deposit or withdrawal of fiat currency into or out of larger Bitcoin Exchanges.


	Despite efforts
	to ensure accurate pricing on a volume-weighted basis, the Bitcoin Index Price, and the price of bitcoins generally, remains subject to volatility experienced by the Bitcoin Exchanges. Such volatility can adversely affect an investment in the
	Shares.




	Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Bitcoin Exchanges, the marketplace may
	lose confidence in Bitcoin Exchanges, upon which the Trust is dependent.




	The Bitcoin Exchanges on which the bitcoins trade are
	relatively new and, in some cases, unregulated. Furthermore, while many prominent Bitcoin Exchanges provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance,
	many Bitcoin Exchanges (including several U.S. Dollar denominated Bitcoin Exchanges and many Chinese Yuan denominated Bitcoin Exchanges) do not provide this information. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in Bitcoin Exchanges,
	including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading.


	The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings is determined using
	the Bitcoin Index Price as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Index utilizes data from Bitcoin Exchanges selected by the Index Provider to determine the weighted average price for bitcoins. For a
	further discussion of the Bitcoin Exchange Market and the selection of Bitcoin Exchanges for inclusion in the Indexs calculation of bitcoin prices, see Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and MarketBitcoin Value and
	Uses of Bitcoins.


	Over the past seven years, some Bitcoin Exchanges have been closed due to fraud, business failure or
	security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of such Bitcoin Exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such Bitcoin Exchanges. While smaller Bitcoin Exchanges are
	less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger Bitcoin Exchanges more stable, larger Bitcoin Exchanges are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware and may be more likely to be targets of regulatory
	enforcement action. For example, in August 2016, it was reported that almost 120,000 bitcoins worth around $78 million were stolen from Bitfinex, a large Bitcoin Exchange. The value of bitcoin immediately decreased over 10% following reports of the
	theft at Bitfinex and the Shares suffered a corresponding decrease in value. Additionally, in January 2015, Bitstamp announced that approximately 19,000 bitcoin had been stolen from its operational or hot wallets. Further, the collapse
	of Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in late February 2014, indicated that even the largest Bitcoin


	 


	16







	Table of Contents



	Exchanges could be subject to abrupt failure with consequences for both users of a Bitcoin Exchange and the bitcoin industry as a whole. In particular, in the two weeks that followed the
	February 7, 2014 halt of bitcoin withdrawals from Mt. Gox, the value of one bitcoin fell on other exchanges from around $795 on February 6, 2014 to $578 on February 20, 2014.


	A lack of stability in the Bitcoin Exchange Market and the closure or temporary shutdown of Bitcoin Exchanges due to fraud, business failure,
	hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the Bitcoin Network and result in greater volatility in the Bitcoin Index Price. Furthermore, the closure or temporary shutdown of a Bitcoin Exchange used in calculating
	the Bitcoin Index Price may result in a loss of confidence in the Trusts ability to determine its Bitcoin Holdings on a daily basis. These potential consequences of a Bitcoin Exchanges failure could adversely affect an investment in the
	Shares.




	Since there is no limit on the number of bitcoins that the Trust may acquire, the Trust itself, as it grows, may have an
	impact on the supply and demand of bitcoins that ultimately may affect the price of the Shares in a manner unrelated to other factors affecting the global market for bitcoins.




	The Trust Agreement places no limit on the number of bitcoins the Trust may hold. Moreover, the Trust may issue an unlimited number of Shares,
	subject to registration requirements, and therefore acquire an unlimited number of bitcoins in existence at any point in time. The global market for bitcoins is characterized by supply and demand constraints that generally are not present in the
	markets for commodities or other assets such as gold and silver. The Bitcoin Networks mathematical protocols under which bitcoins are created or mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined number of bitcoins not to exceed
	21 million. Furthermore, the rate of creation or issuance of bitcoins cannot be increased ahead of the protocols schedule. As of April 28, 2017, approximately 16.30 million bitcoins had been created.


	If the number of bitcoins acquired by the Trust is large enough relative to global bitcoin supply and demand, further creations and
	redemptions of Shares could have an impact on the supply of and demand for bitcoins in a manner unrelated to other factors affecting the global market for bitcoins. Such an impact could affect the Bitcoin Index Price, which would directly affect the
	price at which Shares are traded on NYSE Arca or the price of future Baskets created or redeemed by the Trust.


	As of March 31, 2017,
	the Trust held a closing balance of 174,175 bitcoins that it acquired in the sale of Baskets, representing approximately 1.1% of the total bitcoins in existence. The Trust and the Sponsor cannot provide any assurance that increased bitcoin holdings
	by the Trust in the future will have no long-term impact on the Bitcoin Index Price, thereby affecting Share trading prices.




	The Shares may trade at a discount or premium in the trading price relative to the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share as a result
	of non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca and the Bitcoin Exchange Market.




	The value of a Share may be influenced by
	non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca and various Bitcoin Exchanges, including those that represent components of the Index. While NYSE Arca is open for trading in the Shares for a limited period each day, the Bitcoin Exchange Market is a
	24-hour marketplace; however, trading volume and liquidity on the Bitcoin Exchange Market is not consistent throughout the day and Bitcoin Exchanges, including the larger-volume markets, have been known to shut down temporarily or permanently due to
	security concerns, directed denial of service attacks and DDoS Attacks and other reasons. As a result, during periods when NYSE Arca is open but large Bitcoin Exchanges (or a substantial number of smaller Bitcoin Exchanges) are either lightly traded
	or are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the Shares and the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share. Premiums or discounts may have an
	adverse effect on an investment in the Shares if a Shareholder sells or acquires its Shares during a period of discount or premium, respectively.

	If bitcoin prices on the Exchange Market move negatively during hours when NYSE Arca is
	closed, trading prices on NYSE Arca may gap down at market open.




	The value of a Share may be influenced by
	non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca and various Bitcoin Exchanges, including those that represent components of the Index. While NYSE Arca is open for trading in the Shares for a limited period each day, the Bitcoin Exchange Market is a
	24-hour marketplace. During periods when NYSE Arca is closed but Bitcoin Exchanges are open, significant changes in the price of bitcoin on the Exchange Market could result in a difference in performance between the value of bitcoins as measured by
	the Index and the most recent Bitcoin Holdings per Share or closing trading price. To the extent that the price of bitcoin on the Exchange Market, and the value of bitcoins as measured by the Index, moves significantly in a negative direction after
	the close of NYSE Arca, the trading price of the Shares may gap down to the full extent of such negative price shift when NYSE Arca reopens. To the extent that the price of bitcoin on the Exchange Market drops significantly during hours
	NYSE Arca is closed, investors may not be able to sell their Shares until after the gap down has been fully realized, resulting in an inability to mitigate losses in a rapidly negative market.




	A possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand for the Shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price
	volatility in the Shares.




	Investors may purchase Shares to hedge existing bitcoin or other digital currencies, commodity or
	currency exposure or to speculate on the price of bitcoins. Speculation on the price of bitcoins may involve long and short exposures. To the extent that aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Shares available for purchase (for example, in
	the event that large redemption requests by Authorized Participants dramatically affect Share liquidity), investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase Shares for delivery to Share lenders. Those repurchases may, in turn,
	dramatically increase the price of the Shares until additional Shares are created through the creation process. This is often referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in the Shares that are
	not directly correlated to the price of bitcoins.




	Purchasing activity in the Bitcoin Exchange Market associated with Basket
	creations or selling activity following Basket redemptions may affect the Bitcoin Index Price and Share trading prices, adversely affecting an investment in the Shares.




	Purchasing activity associated with acquiring bitcoins required for deposit with the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets may
	increase the market price of bitcoins on the Bitcoin Exchange Market, which will result in higher prices for the Shares. Increases in the market price of bitcoins may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants.
	Other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of bitcoins that may result from increased purchasing activity of bitcoins connected with the issuance of Baskets. Consequently, the market price of bitcoins may
	decline immediately after Baskets are created.


	Selling activity associated with sales of bitcoins withdrawn from the Trust in connection
	with the redemption of Baskets may decrease the market price of bitcoins on the Bitcoin Exchange Market, which will result in lower prices for the Shares. Decreases in the market price of bitcoins may also occur as a result of the selling activity
	of other market participants. If the Bitcoin Index Price declines, the trading price of the Shares will generally also decline.




	An
	investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in bitcoins.




	The Trust competes
	with direct investments in bitcoins and other potential financial vehicles, possibly including securities backed by or linked to bitcoins and digital currency financial vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other
	conditions beyond the Sponsors control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in bitcoins directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares.


	 


	18







	Table of Contents





	The Bitcoin Index Price may be affected by the sale of other digital currency financial
	vehicles that invest in and track the price of bitcoins.




	To the extent digital currency financial vehicles other than the Trust
	tracking the price of bitcoins are formed and represent a significant proportion of the demand for bitcoins, large redemptions of the securities of these digital currency financial vehicles, or private funds holding bitcoins, could negatively affect
	the Bitcoin Index Price, the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and the price of the Shares.




	The impact of geopolitical or economic
	events on the supply and demand for bitcoins is uncertain, but could motivate large-scale sales of bitcoins, which could result in a reduction in the Bitcoin Index Price and adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	As an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, digital assets such as bitcoins, which are relatively new, are
	subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless,
	political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of bitcoins either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of bitcoins would result in a reduction in the Bitcoin Index Price and could adversely affect an investment in the
	Shares.




	Demand for bitcoins is driven, in part, by its status as the most prominent and secure digital asset. It is possible that a
	digital asset other than bitcoins could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoins, which could have a negative impact on the price of bitcoins and
	adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The Bitcoin Network and bitcoins, as an asset, hold a first-to-market
	advantage over other digital assets. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more importantly, the largest combined mining power in use to secure the Blockchain and transaction verification system.
	See Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and MarketCryptographic Security Used in the Bitcoin Network. Having a large mining network results in greater user confidence regarding the security and long-term stability of a digital
	assets network and its blockchain; as a result, the advantage of more users and miners makes a digital asset more secure, which makes it more attractive to new users and miners, resulting in a network effect that strengthens the
	first-to-market advantage.


	As of April 28, 2017, there were over 800 alternate digital assets (or altcoins) tracked by
	CoinMarketCap.com, having a total market capitalization (including bitcoin) of approximately $33.97 billion, using market prices and total available supply of each digital asset. According to CoinMarketCap.coms calculations, bitcoins
	represented approximately 62% of the total market capitalization of all digital assets. As of April 28, 2017, bitcoins $21.8 billion market capitalization was approximately 3.7 times as large as the $5.88 billion market
	capitalization of Ethereum (the second largest digital currency by market capitalization) and approximately 12.8 times larger than the $1.70 million market capitalization of Ripple (the third largest digital currency by market capitalization).
	Bitcoin also enjoys significantly greater acceptance and usage than other altcoin networks in the retail and commercial marketplace, due in large part to the relatively well-funded efforts of payment processing companies including BitPay and
	Coinbase.


	Despite the marked first-mover advantage of the Bitcoin Network over other digital assets, it is possible that an altcoin
	could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the Bitcoin Network protocol that is not immediately addressed by the Core Developers or a perceived advantage of an altcoin that includes features not incorporated
	into Bitcoin. If an altcoin obtains significant market share (either in market capitalization, mining power or use as a payment technology), this could reduce Bitcoins market share and have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of,
	bitcoins.

	Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares





	As the Sponsor and its management have no meaningful history of operating an investment vehicle like the Trust, their experience may be
	inadequate or unsuitable to manage the Trust.




	The Sponsor was formed to be the Sponsor of the Trust and has no meaningful history
	of past performance in managing investment vehicles like the Trust. The past performances of the Sponsors management in other investment vehicles, including their experiences in the Bitcoin and venture capital industries, are no indication of
	their ability to manage an investment vehicle such as the Trust. If the experience of the Sponsor and its management is inadequate or unsuitable to manage an investment vehicle such as the Trust, the operations of the Trust may be adversely
	affected.




	The value of the Shares could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise.




	The mechanisms and procedures governing the creation, redemption and offering of the Shares and storage of the bitcoins have been developed
	specifically for this product. There may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the Trusts operations and the trading of the Shares that could have an adverse effect on an investment in the Shares. In addition,
	although the Trust is not actively managed by traditional methods, to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise, the Sponsors past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving
	these problems or issues.




	The Shares may trade at a price which is at, above or below the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share
	and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent trading hours.




	The Shares may trade on NYSE Arca at, above or below the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share. The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share
	will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trusts assets. The trading price of the Shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share as well as market supply and demand. The price
	difference may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the public trading market for Shares are closely related, but not identical, to the same forces influencing the Bitcoin Index Price. Consequently, an
	Authorized Participant may be able to create or redeem a Basket of Shares at a discount or a premium to the public trading price per Share.


	Authorized Participants, or their clients or customers, may have an opportunity to realize a riskless profit if they can create a Basket at a
	discount to the public trading price of the Shares or can redeem a Basket at a premium over the public trading price of the Shares. The Sponsor expects that the exploitation of such arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their
	clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track the Bitcoin Holdings per Share closely over time. Such arbitrage opportunities will not be available to Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants.




	If Authorized Participants are able to purchase or sell large aggregations of bitcoins in the open market at prices that are different
	than the Bitcoin Index Price, the arbitrage mechanism intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Bitcoin Index Price may not function properly and the Shares may trade at a discount or premium to the Bitcoin Holdings per Share.




	The arbitrage mechanism on which the Trust relies to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Bitcoin Index Price may
	not function properly if Authorized Participants are able to purchase or sell large aggregations of bitcoins in the open market at prices that are materially higher or lower than the Bitcoin Index Price. Authorized Participants may purchase or sell
	bitcoins on public or private markets not included among the Bitcoin Exchanges included in the Index, and such transactions may take place at prices materially higher or lower than the Bitcoin Index Price. Furthermore, while the Index provides a
	U.S. Dollar-denominated composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin based on the volume-weighted price of a bitcoin on certain constituent Bitcoin Exchanges at any given time, the prices on each individual Bitcoin Exchange are not
	necessarily equal to the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index.

	For example, based on data provided by the Index Provider, from May 10, 2015 to April 28,
	2017, the maximum variance of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single exchange included in the Index from the Bitcoin Index Price was 8.8% and the average maximum variance of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single
	exchange from the Bitcoin Index Price was 7.3%. During this same period, the average variance of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot prices of all the exchanges included in the Index from the Bitcoin Index Price was 0.8%. The timeframe chosen reflects
	the longest continuous period during which the four Bitcoin Exchanges that are currently included in the Index have been constituents. All Bitcoin Exchanges that were included in the Index throughout the period were considered in this analysis.


	Further, based on data provided by the Index Provider for the same period, the maximum variance of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot
	price on any single U.S. Dollar denominated exchange with the eight highest trading volumes from the Bitcoin Index Price was 9.2% and the average maximum variance of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single exchange from the Bitcoin
	Index Price was 7.7%. During the same period, the average variance of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of the U.S. Dollar denominated exchanges with the eight highest trading volumes from the Bitcoin Index Price was 0.9%.


	Although the average price variance between the Bitcoin Index Price and the price of bitcoins on the Bitcoin Exchanges, both individually and
	as a group, has historically been immaterial, the price of bitcoins on an individual Bitcoin Exchange has historically, and could in the future, be materially higher or lower than the Bitcoin Index Price. Under either such circumstance, the
	arbitrage mechanism will function to link the price of the Shares to the prices at which Authorized Participants are able to purchase or sell large aggregations of bitcoins. To the extent such prices differ materially from the Bitcoin Index Price,
	the price of the Shares may no longer track, whether temporarily or over time, the Bitcoin Index Price, which could adversely affect an investment in the Trust by reducing investors confidence in the Shares ability to track the market
	price of bitcoins and the Bitcoin Index Price.




	If the processes of creation and redemption of Baskets encounter any unanticipated
	difficulties, the opportunities for arbitrage transactions intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Bitcoin Index Price may not exist and, as a result, the price of the Shares may fall.




	If the creation and redemption of the Shares (which depend on timely transfers of bitcoins to and from the custody accounts maintained by the
	Custodian) encounter any unanticipated difficulties, including, but not limited to, the Trusts inability in the future to obtain regulatory approvals for the offer and sale of additional Shares after the present offering is completed,
	potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the price of the underlying bitcoins may not
	take the risk that, as a result of those difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect. If this is the case, the liquidity of Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the Bitcoin Index
	Price and may fall.




	The postponement, suspension or rejection of creation or redemption orders may adversely affect an investment
	in the Shares.




	Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor may suspend or reject creation or redemption orders, as applicable, for a
	variety of permitted reasons under certain circumstances. To the extent such orders are suspended or rejected, the arbitrage mechanism resulting from the process through which Authorized Participants create and redeem Shares directly with the Trust
	may fail to closely link the price of the Shares to the value of the underlying bitcoins, as measured using the Bitcoin Index Price. If this is the case, the liquidity of the Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently
	of the Bitcoin Index Price and may fall.


	Furthermore, the placement of in-cash creation and redemption orders require additional
	administrative steps as compared to in-kind creation and redemption orders, which could hinder arbitrage opportunities for

	in-cash

	creation and redemption orders. The Sponsor, Administrator or Marketing
	Agents failure to quickly execute such administrative steps could cause a delay in the execution of an Authorized Participants order,


	 


	21







	Table of Contents



	which could hinder an Authorized Participants ability to arbitrage the difference between the Bitcoin Index Price and the price of the Shares, thereby impacting an Authorized
	Participants ability to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Bitcoin Index Price. See Description of Creation and Redemption of Shares.




	The Trust could experience unforeseen difficulties in operating and maintaining key elements of its technical infrastructure.




	The Bitcoin Account has been designed specifically to provide security for the Trusts assets, and may be expanded, updated
	and altered from time to time. Any effort to expand, update or alter the security system is likely to be complex, and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects may lead to unanticipated project costs, operational inefficiencies or
	vulnerabilities to security breaches. In addition, there may be problems with the design or implementation of the Bitcoin Account or with an expansion or upgrade thereto that are not evident during the testing phases of design and implementation,
	and that may only become apparent after the Trust has utilized the infrastructure. Any issues relating to the performance and effectiveness of the security procedures used by the Trust and the Custodian to protect the Bitcoin Account, such as
	algorithms, codes, passwords, multiple signature systems, encryption and telephone call-backs (together, the Security Procedures), may have an adverse impact on an investment in the Shares.


	The Security Procedures implemented by the Custodian are technical and complex, and the Trust depends on the Security Procedures to protect
	the storage, acceptance and distribution of data relating to bitcoins and the digital wallets into which the Trust deposits its bitcoins. The Security Procedures may not protect against all errors, software flaws (i.e., bugs) or vulnerabilities.
	Defects in the Security Procedures may only be discovered after a failure in the Custodians safekeeping and storage of the Trusts bitcoins.


	It is not uncommon for businesses in the bitcoin space to experience large losses due to fraud and breaches of their security systems. For
	example, in September 2015, the global bitcoin payment agent, BitPay, lost approximately $1.8 million of bitcoins due to a hackers fraudulent impersonation of BitPays CFO, whereby the hacker was able to access the CFOs email
	account and successfully request BitPays custodian to transfer funds.


	Furthermore, the Trusts private keys required to
	transfer the Trusts bitcoins are stored in vaults located across the world, including but not limited to the United States, Europe, including Switzerland, and South America, which could be subject to (i) hostile regulatory treatment of
	bitcoin, (ii) unforeseen social, economic or political unrest and (iii) natural or man-made disaster. For example, one of the Custodians vaults is located in a South American country that could be considered to have an elevated risk
	of hostile regulatory treatment and social, economic or political unrest, including high rates of inflation and general economic mismanagement. If a vault were compromised, it could cause a possible delay in operations of up to 72 hours which could
	have a negative impact on the value of the Shares.




	The Trusts and the Custodians ability to adopt technology in
	response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the Trusts bitcoins.




	Bitcoin Exchanges
	and large holders of bitcoins must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard client accounts. While the Sponsor believes the Security Procedures in place have been reasonably designed to safeguard the Trusts bitcoins from
	theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack, such assessment is based upon known technology and threats. As technological change occurs, the security threats to the Trusts bitcoins will likely adapt
	and previously unknown threats may emerge. Furthermore, the Sponsor believes that the Trust may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the Trusts assets grows. To the extent that the Trust or the Custodian is unable
	to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, the Trusts bitcoins may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Shares or result in loss of the Trusts
	assets.

	Table of Contents





	Security threats to the Bitcoin Account could result in the halting of Trust operations,
	the suspension of redemptions, and a loss of Trust assets or damage to the reputation of the Trust, each of which could result in a reduction in the price of the Shares.




	Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the Bitcoin Exchange Market since the launch
	of the Bitcoin Network. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer
	equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm the Trusts business operations or result in loss of the Trusts assets. Any breach of the Trusts infrastructure could result in damage to the Trusts
	reputation and reduce demand for the Shares, resulting in a reduction in the price of the Shares. Furthermore, the Sponsor believes that, as the Trusts assets grow, it may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and
	malware.


	The Sponsor believes that the Security Procedures that the Sponsor and Custodian utilize, such as hardware redundancy,
	segregation and offline data storage (i.e., the maintenance of data on computers and/or storage media that is not directly connected to or accessible from the internet and/or networked with other computers, also known as cold storage)
	protocols are reasonably designed to safeguard the Trusts bitcoins from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, the Security Procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss
	due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by the Trust, absent gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Sponsor, the Custodian or their agents.


	The Security Procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an
	employee of the Sponsor or Custodian, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Bitcoin Account, private keys, data or bitcoins. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the
	Custodian or the Sponsor to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Trusts infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be
	designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Sponsor may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived
	breach of the Bitcoin Account occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of the Trust could be harmed, which could result in a reduction in the price of the Shares.


	In the event of a security breach of the Bitcoin Account, the Trust may cease operations, suspend redemptions or suffer a reduction in assets,
	the occurrence of each of which could result in a reduction in the price of the Shares.




	A loss of confidence or breach in the
	Trusts security and technology policies may adversely affect the Trust and the value of an investment in the Shares.




	The
	Trust, Sponsor, Custodian and each of their agents will take measures to protect the Trust and its bitcoins from unauthorized access, damage or theft. However, it is possible that the Security Procedures in place may not prevent the improper access
	to, or damage or theft of the Trusts bitcoins. A security breach could harm the Trusts reputation or result in the loss of some or all of the Trusts bitcoins, which represent the Trusts only asset. A resulting perception that
	the Security Procedures do not adequately protect the Trusts bitcoins could result in a loss of current or potential Shareholders, reducing demand for, and price of, the Shares.




	Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly
	executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	Bitcoin transactions are not reversible without
	the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the Blockchain, an


	 


	23







	Table of Contents



	incorrect transfer of bitcoins or a theft of bitcoins generally will not be reversible and the Trust may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although the
	Trusts transfers of bitcoins will regularly be made to or from the Bitcoin Account, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Trusts bitcoins could be transferred from the Trust
	Custody Account in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts.


	For example, in September 2014, the
	Chinese bitcoin exchange Huobi announced that it had sent approximately 900 bitcoins and 8,000 litecoins (worth approximately $400,000 at the prevailing market prices at the time) to the wrong customers, although it claimed that many customers
	returned the bitcoins and litecoins. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the Trusts bitcoins through error or theft,
	the Trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred Trust bitcoins. The Trust will also be unable to convert or recover Trust bitcoins transferred to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek
	redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	The Trusts bitcoins may be
	subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.




	There is a risk that some or all of the Trusts bitcoins could be
	lost, stolen or destroyed. The Sponsor believes that the Trusts bitcoins held in the Bitcoin Account will be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal the Trusts bitcoins. Although the
	Custodian uses Security Procedures with various elements such as redundancy, segregation and cold storage to minimize the risk of loss, damage and theft, neither the Custodian nor the Sponsor can guarantee the prevention of such loss, damage or
	theft, whether caused intentionally, accidentally or by an act of God. Access to the Trusts bitcoins could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake or flood) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these events
	may adversely affect the operations of the Trust and, consequently, an investment in the Shares.




	The Shareholders limited
	rights of legal recourse against the Trust, Trustee, Sponsor, Transfer Agent, Administrator and Custodian expose the Trust and its Shareholders to the risk of loss of the Trusts bitcoins for which no person is liable.




	Shareholders recourse against the Trust, Trustee, Custodian and Sponsor under New York law governing their custody operations is limited.
	Similarly, the Shareholders recourse against the Sponsor, the Transfer Agent and the Administrator for the services they provide to the Trust, including those relating to the provision of instructions relating to the movement of bitcoins, is
	limited. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trusts bitcoins for which no person is liable in damages. Further, there is no third-party insurance to cover any loss that may be suffered with respect to the Trusts
	bitcoins.




	Bitcoins held by the Trust are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.




	The Trust is not a banking institution or otherwise a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or Securities
	Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and, therefore, deposits held with or assets held by the Trust are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. The undivided interests in the
	Trusts bitcoins represented by Shares in the Trust are not insured directly by the Trustee or the Sponsor.




	The
	Custodians limited liability under the Custodian Agreement may impair the ability of the Trust to recover losses relating to its bitcoins and any recovery may be limited, even in the event of fraud, to the market value of the bitcoins at the
	time the fraud is discovered.




	Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodians liability is limited to the greater of
	(i) the market value of the Custodial Coins at the time the events giving rise to the liability occurred and (ii) the fair market value of the Custodial Coins at the time that the Custodian notifies the Sponsor or Trustee in writing, or
	the Sponsor or the Trustee otherwise has actual knowledge of the events giving rise to the liability.

	In addition, the Custodian will not be liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance
	of any of its custodial obligations under the Trust Agreement or any Authorized Participant Self-Administered Agreement by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, war or terrorism. The Custodian will also not be
	liable for any system failure or third-party penetration of the Bitcoin Account, unless such system failure or third-party penetration is the result of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Custodian. As a result, the
	recourse of the Trust or the Shareholder, under New York law, is limited.




	The Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if
	its bitcoins are lost, stolen or destroyed.




	If the Trusts bitcoins are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances
	rendering a party liable to the Trust, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trusts claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust might be limited
	to the Custodian or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (for example, a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust.




	The liquidity of the Shares may be affected if Authorized Participants or Liquidity Providers cease to perform their obligations
	under the Participant Agreements.




	In the event that one or more Authorized Participants having substantial interests in Shares or
	otherwise responsible for a significant portion of the Shares daily trading volume on NYSE Arca terminates its Participant Agreement, the liquidity of the Shares would likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of, and an
	investment in, the Shares.


	In addition, if one or more Liquidity Providers refuses, or is unable, to perform its obligations under its
	Participant Agreements, the Trust may have difficulty maintaining the participation of certain Authorized Participants or engaging additional Authorized Participants. Under such circumstances, the liquidity of the Shares would likely decrease, which
	could adversely affect the market price of, and an investment in, the Shares.




	There is no guarantee that an active trading market
	for the Shares will continue to develop.




	Prior to this offering, the Shares traded on the over-the-counter exchange, OTCQX. There
	can be no assurance an active trading market of the Shares will develop on NYSE Arca. The Sponsor may elect to terminate the Trust if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Trust is not an economically viable size, which could result in the
	liquidation of the Trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders.


	To the extent that NYSE Arca halts trading in
	the Shares, whether on a temporary or permanent basis, investors may not be able to buy or sell Shares, thus adversely affecting an investment in the Shares. If an active trading market for the Shares does not exist or continue to exist, the market
	prices and liquidity of the Shares may be adversely affected.




	The Trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that
	is disadvantageous to Shareholders.




	If the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could
	occur at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders, such as when the Bitcoin Index Price is lower than it was at the time when Shareholders purchased their Shares. In such a case, when the Trusts bitcoins are sold as part of the
	Trusts liquidation, the resulting proceeds distributed to Shareholders will be less than if the Bitcoin Index Price were higher at the time of sale. See Description of the Trust DocumentsDescription of the Trust AgreementThe
	TrusteeTermination of the Trust for more information about the termination of the Trust, including when the termination of the Trust may be triggered by events outside the direct control of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Shareholders.

	The Trust Agreement includes a provision that restricts the right of a beneficial owner of
	a statutory trust from bringing a derivative action.




	Under Delaware law, the right of a beneficial owner of a statutory trust
	(such as a Shareholder of the Trust) to bring a derivative action (i.e., to initiate a lawsuit in the name of a the statutory trust in order to assert a claim belonging to the statutory trust against a fiduciary of the statutory trust or against a
	third-party when the statutory trusts management has refused to do so) may be restricted by the terms of the governing instrument of the statutory trust. The Trust Agreement provides that in addition to any other requirements of applicable
	law, no Shareholder shall have the right, power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Trust unless two or more Shareholders who (i) are not affiliates of one another and
	(ii) collectively hold at least 10% of the outstanding Shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action, suit or other proceeding. Therefore, the Trust Agreement limits the likelihood that a Shareholder could successfully assert a
	derivative action.




	The Administrator is solely responsible for determining the value of the bitcoins, and any errors,
	discontinuance or changes in such valuation calculations may have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares.




	The Administrator
	will determine the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share on a daily basis as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time on each business day. The Administrators determination is made utilizing data from the
	Custodians operations and the Bitcoin Index Price, calculated at 4:00 p.m., New York time on such day. To the extent that the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings or Bitcoin Holdings per Share are incorrectly calculated, the Administrator may not be
	liable for any error and such misreporting of valuation data could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	Extraordinary
	expenses resulting from unanticipated events may become payable by the Trust, adversely affecting an investment in the Shares.




	In consideration for the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor has contractually assumed the Sponsor-assumed Fees, which are certain operational and
	periodic expenses of the Trust. See Activities of the TrustTrust Expenses. Extraordinary expenses of the Trust (for example, expenses relating to litigation) are not assumed by the Sponsor and are instead borne by the Trust and
	paid through the sale of the Trusts bitcoins. Because the Trust does not generate any income, every time that it delivers bitcoins to the Sponsor for the Sponsors Fee or sells bitcoins for the Additional Trust Expenses, the number of
	bitcoins represented by each Share will gradually decrease over time. In addition, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, increase the Sponsors Fee or decrease the Sponsor-paid Expenses which could result in a greater decline in the number
	of bitcoins that the Trust holds. Such an increase in the Sponsors Fee or decrease in the Sponsor-paid Expenses could occur if the expenses of the Trust materially increase. Alternatively, the Sponsor could choose to decrease the
	Sponsors Fee in response to competitive pressures from other digital currency financial vehicles similar to the Trust. The Sponsor will balance such competitive pressures and the costs that it incurs in acting as Sponsor for the Trust when
	determining the Sponsors Fee.




	The Trusts delivery or sale of bitcoins to pay expenses or other operations of the
	Trust could result in Shareholders incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the Trust.




	Assuming that the
	Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery of bitcoins by the Trust to pay the Sponsors Fee or other expenses and each sale of bitcoins by the Trust to pay Additional Trust Expenses will be a
	taxable event to Shareholders. Thus, the Trusts payment of expenses could result in Shareholders incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the Trust. Any such tax liability could adversely affect an investment in
	the Shares. See U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.

	If the Trust incurs extraordinary expenses in U.S. Dollars, the Trust will sell bitcoins to
	pay these expenses. The sale of the Trusts bitcoins to pay expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares.




	The Sponsor will sell bitcoins held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor on an as-needed basis, irrespective of
	then-current bitcoin prices on the Bitcoin Exchange Market. The Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of bitcoins. Consequently, if the Trust incurs expenses in
	U.S. Dollars, the Trusts bitcoins may be sold at a time when the bitcoin prices on the Bitcoin Exchange Market are low, resulting in a negative impact on the value of the Shares.




	The value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent,
	the Administrator or the Custodian under the Trust Documents.




	Under the Trust Documents, each of the Sponsor, the Trustee, the
	Transfer Agent, the Administrator and the Custodian has a right to be indemnified by the Trust for certain liabilities or expenses that it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part. Therefore, the Sponsor, Trustee,
	Transfer Agent, the Administrator or Custodian may require that the assets of the Trust be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it. Any sale of that kind would reduce the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and the value of the Shares.




	Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the Trust and an investment in the Shares.




	The Sponsor is not aware of any intellectual property rights claims that may prevent the Trust from operating and holding bitcoins; however,
	third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims relating to the operation of the Trust and the mechanics instituted for the investment in, holding of and transfer of bitcoins. Regardless of the merit of an intellectual property or other
	legal action, any legal expenses to defend or payments to settle such claims would be Additional Trust Expenses and be borne by the Trust through the sale of the Trusts bitcoins. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property rights claim
	could prevent the Trust from operating and force the Sponsor to terminate the Trust and liquidate the Trusts bitcoins. As a result, an intellectual property rights claim against the Trust could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.






	Risk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares





	Shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment
	Company Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.




	The Investment Company Act is designed to protect investors by preventing
	insiders from managing investment companies to their benefit and to the detriment of public investors, such as: the issuance of securities having inequitable or discriminatory provisions; the management of investment companies by irresponsible
	persons; the use of unsound or misleading methods of computing earnings and asset value; changes in the character of investment companies without the consent of investors; and investment companies from engaging in excessive leveraging. To accomplish
	these ends, the Investment Company Act requires the safekeeping and proper valuation of fund assets, restricts greatly transactions with affiliates, limits leveraging, and imposes governance requirements as a check on fund management.


	The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not required
	to register under such act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies.


	The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC. Furthermore, the Sponsor
	believes that the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the operation
	of the Trust. Consequently, Shareholders will not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated instruments or commodity pools.

	The Trust and an affiliate of the Trust recently entered into a settlement agreement with
	the SEC concerning the operation of the Trusts former redemption program.




	On April 1, 2014, a program was launched pursuant
	to which Shareholders could request redemptions from Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the sole Authorized Participant at that time. On September 23, 2014, Genesis received a letter from the staff of the SECs Office of Compliance
	Inspections and Examinations summarizing the staffs findings from an onsite review of Genesiss broker-dealer activities conducted in June 2014. In its exit report, the staff stated that it had concluded that the Trusts redemption
	program, in which Shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares through Genesis, appeared to violate Regulation M under the Exchange Act because such redemptions of Shares took place at the same time the Trust was in the
	process of creating Shares. On July 11, 2016, Genesis and the Trust entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange
	Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. The Trust is seeking an exemption from the SEC under Regulation M in order to reinstate
	its redemption program, but cannot at this time predict whether it will be successful in obtaining such regulatory relief.




	Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in the Shares or restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of
	the Bitcoin Network or the Bitcoin Exchange Market in a manner that adversely affects an investment in the Shares.




	As bitcoins
	have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Department of Justice, the
	Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS, and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the Bitcoin Network, bitcoin users and the Bitcoin Exchange Market, with particular focus on the extent to
	which bitcoins can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service providers that hold bitcoins for users. Many of these state and federal
	agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by bitcoins to investors. On-going and future regulatory actions may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares or the ability of the
	Trust to continue to operate.


	In 2013 guidance, FinCEN took the position that any administrator or exchanger of convertible digital
	currencies, including bitcoins, must register with FinCEN as a money transmitter and must comply with the anti-money laundering regulations applicable to money transmitters. FinCEN subsequently issued several interpretive letters clarifying which
	entities would be considered administrators or exchangers and which would be considered mere users not subject to registration. The requirement that bitcoin exchangers that do business in the U.S. register with FinCEN and comply with
	anti-money laundering regulations may increase the cost of buying and selling bitcoins and therefore may adversely affect their price.


	In
	2015, the NYDFS finalized a rule that requires most businesses involved in digital currency business activity in or involving New York, excluding merchants and consumers, to apply for a license, commonly known as a BitLicense, from the NYDFS and to
	comply with anti-money laundering, cyber security, consumer protection, and financial and reporting requirements, among others. As an alternative to the BitLicense in New York, firms can apply for a charter to become limited purpose trust companies
	qualified to engage in digital currency business activity. Other states have considered regimes similar to the BitLicense (for example, a bill in California would have imposed a similar regime, although the bill was shelved), or have required
	digital currency businesses to register with their states as money transmitters, such as Washington and Georgia, which results in digital currency businesses being subject to requirements similar to those of NYDFS BitLicense regime. Certain
	state regulators, such as the Texas Department of Banking, Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, have found that mere transmission of bitcoin, without activities involving
	transmission of fiat currency, does not constitute money transmission requiring


	 


	28







	Table of Contents



	licensure. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks has issued guidance providing that North Carolinas money transmission regulations only apply to the transmission of digital currency and
	not its use. The inconsistency in applying money transmitting licensure requirements to certain bitcoin businesses may make it more difficult for bitcoin businesses to provide services, which may affect consumer adoption of bitcoin and its price.


	To date, the SEC has not asserted regulatory authority over the Bitcoin Network or bitcoin trading or ownership and has not expressed the
	view that digital currencies, including bitcoin should be classified or treated as securities for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws. However, the SEC has commented on bitcoin and bitcoin-related market developments and has taken action
	against investment schemes involving bitcoin. For example, in the SECs recent review of proposed rule changes to list and trade shares of certain bitcoin-related investment vehicles on public markets, they have stated that the bitcoin markets
	are not properly regulated. The SEC asserts that this results in the public markets inability to enter into surveillance-sharing agreements that help address concerns regarding fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices.


	If the SEC were to determine that bitcoin is a security, the Trust and the Sponsor would be subject to additional regulatory and compliance
	requirements under U.S. federal securities laws, including the Investment Company Act and, with respect to the Sponsor, the Investment Advisers Act.


	The CFTC treats bitcoin and other digital currencies as commodities under the CEA, thereby asserting jurisdiction over futures,
	swaps, and other CFTC-regulated derivatives that reference digital currencies. The CFTC has not, to date, taken the view that bitcoin is a commodity interest, which is defined under the CEA to include futures, swaps, and other
	derivatives based on commodities. Commodity interests are subject to CFTC regulation and thus, if bitcoin were to be deemed a commodity interest by the CFTC, the Trust and the Sponsor would be subject to additional regulatory and compliance
	requirements under the CEA and CFTC regulations.


	To the extent that future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to
	exchange bitcoins or utilize them for payments, the demand for bitcoins will be reduced and Authorized Participants may not seek to redeem Redemption Baskets in exchange for redemption proceeds in bitcoins. Furthermore, regulatory actions may limit
	the ability of end-users to convert bitcoins into fiat currency (for example, U.S. Dollars) or use bitcoins to pay for goods and services. Such regulatory actions or policies would result in a reduction of demand, and in turn, the Bitcoin Index
	Price and the price of the Shares.


	Bitcoins currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as
	the European Union, China, Japan and Russia. While certain governments such as Germany where the Ministry of Finance has declared digital currencies such as bitcoins to be Rechnungseinheiten (a form of private money that is recognized as
	a unit of account, but not recognized in the same manner as fiat currency) have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoins, most regulatory bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding their intention to regulate or determinations on
	regulation of bitcoins, bitcoin users and the Bitcoin Network. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that bitcoin transactions throughout the European Union should be treated as a traditional currency transactions and not be subject
	to value-added tax. In April 2016, Her Majestys Treasury announced its plan to apply the United Kingdoms anti-money laundering regulations to digital currency exchange firms, but not to wallet services that do not offer fiat-to-digital
	exchange functionality. In April 2017, the Russian regulators indicated their plan to recognize bitcoin and other digital currencies as a legitimate financial instrument by 2018, as part of the governments broader efforts to tackle money
	laundering, standing in sharp contrast with the governments previous attempts to ban the conversion of bitcoin and other money surrogates into fiat currency and impose criminal penalties for such violations.


	In China, a December 2013 government notice classified bitcoins as virtual commodities, and not legal tender. The same notice
	restricted the existing banking and payment industries from using bitcoin, limiting the scope of the operations of bitcoin exchanges in one of the largest bitcoin markets. In January 2017, in response to informal guidance received from the
	Peoples Bank of China (the PBoC) concerning the creation of tighter anti-money laundering and foreign exchange controls, the largest China-based Bitcoin ExchangesBTCC,


	 


	29







	Table of Contents



	Huobi and OKCoinadjusted their terms to pause or limit loan and borrowing services. These three exchanges later introduced a 0.2% fixed-rate transaction fee for all bitcoin buy and sell
	orders, with similar measures soon adopted by many of Chinas smaller bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin withdrawals have also been halted on BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin. In March 2017, the PBoC reaffirmed its commitment to regulating Bitcoin Exchanges and
	indicated the possibility of licensing a number of qualified exchanges. These events have substantially reduced trading volume on Chinese exchanges.


	In 2016, the Australian government announced its plan to update its anti-money laundering laws to apply to digital currency exchanges,
	following an inquiry by the government into the countrys tax treatment and regulation of bitcoin. In Japan, regulations went into effect in April 2017 that recognize digital currencies as a legal method of payment and require market
	participants, including exchanges, to meet certain compliance requirements and be subject to oversight by the Financial Services Agency, a Japanese regulator. The government of Israel and the Israel Tax Authority decided in January 2017 to apply
	capital gains tax to sales of bitcoins and other digital currencies. Conversely, regulatory bodies in some countries such as India have declined to exercise regulatory authority when afforded the opportunity. At the other extreme, in 2014, Ecuador,
	Bolivia, and Bangladesh banned the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies.


	Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future,
	adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Bitcoin Network, the Bitcoin Exchange Market and their users, particularly Bitcoin Exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions regulatory scope. Such laws,
	regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of bitcoins by users, merchants and service providers outside the United States and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of
	the bitcoin economy in the European Union, China, Japan, Russia and the United States and globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of bitcoins.


	Additionally, U.S. state and Federal, and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against virtual currency businesses or enacted
	restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks, consumer harm, or criminal activity stemming from virtual currency activity. The value of bitcoins could thus be impacted by such adverse publicity.








	If regulatory changes or interpretations of an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Providers activities require the
	regulation of an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider as a money service business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act or as a money transmitter or virtual currency business under state
	regimes for the licensing of such businesses, an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may be required to register and comply with such regulations, which could result in extraordinary, recurring and/or nonrecurring expenses to the Authorized
	Participant or Liquidity Provider or increased commissions for the Authorized Participant or Liquidity Providers clients, thereby reducing the liquidity of the Trust.




	To the extent that the activities of an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider cause it to be deemed a money services
	business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate an
	Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. Similarly, the activities of an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may require it to be
	licensed as a money transmitter or as a virtual currency business, such as under NYDFSs BitLicense scheme.


	Such additional
	regulatory obligations may cause the Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly increasing the levels of the commissions that an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider charges its clients in a
	material and adverse manner. If an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may terminate its role as an
	Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider of the Trust. Such a termination may decrease the liquidity of the Trust.


	 


	30







	Table of Contents



	Additionally, to the extent an Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider is found to have
	operated without appropriate state or federal licenses, it may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which would harm the reputation of the Trust or its Sponsor,
	decrease the liquidity of the Trust, and have a material adverse effect on the price of the Shares.




	Banks may not provide
	banking services, or may cut off banking services, to businesses that provide bitcoin-related services or that accept bitcoin as payment, which could damage the public perception of bitcoin and the utility of bitcoin as a payment system and could
	decrease the price of bitcoins and adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	A number of companies that provide
	bitcoin-related services have been unable to find banks that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and banking services. Similarly, a number of such companies have had their existing bank accounts closed by their banks. Banks may refuse to
	provide bank accounts and other banking services to bitcoin-related companies or companies that accept bitcoin for a number of reasons, such as perceived compliance risks or costs. The difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoin-related
	services have and may continue to have in finding banks willing to provide them with bank accounts and other banking services may be currently decreasing the usefulness of bitcoin as a payment system and harming public perception of bitcoin or could
	decrease its usefulness and harm its public perception in the future. Similarly, the usefulness of bitcoin as a payment system and the public perception of bitcoin could be damaged if banks were to close the accounts of many or of a few key
	businesses providing bitcoin-related services. This could decrease the price of bitcoins and therefore adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	It may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoins in one or more countries, and ownership of, holding
	or trading in Shares may also be considered illegal and subject to sanctions.




	The United States, China, Russia or other
	jurisdictions may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoins or to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency. Such an action may also result in the restriction of ownership, holding
	or trading in the Shares. Such a restriction could subject the Trust or its Sponsor to investigations, civil or criminal fines and penalties, which could harm the reputation of the Trust or its Sponsor, and could result in the termination and
	liquidation of the Trust at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders, or may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.




	If
	regulatory changes or interpretations of the Trusts or Sponsors activities require registration as money service businesses under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act or as money
	transmitters or digital currency businesses under state regimes for the licensing of such businesses, the Trust and/or Sponsor could suffer reputational harm and also extraordinary, recurring and/or nonrecurring expenses, which would adversely
	impact an investment in the Shares.




	If regulatory changes or interpretations of the Trusts or Sponsors activities
	require the registration of the Trust or Sponsor as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the Trust or Sponsor may be required to register and comply with such
	regulations. If regulatory changes or interpretations of the Trusts or Sponsors activities require the licensing or other registration as a money transmitter or business engaged in digital currency activity (e.g., under the New York
	BitLicense regime) (or equivalent designation) under state law in any state in which the Trust or Sponsor operates, the Trust or Sponsor may be required to seek licensure or otherwise register and comply with such state law. In the event of any such
	requirement, to the extent that the Sponsor decides to continue the Trust, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust. Regulatory compliance would include,
	among other things, implementing anti-money laundering and consumer protection programs. The Sponsor may also decide to terminate the Trust. Any termination of the Trust in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is
	disadvantageous to Shareholders.

	To the extent the Trust or its Sponsor is found to have operated without appropriate state or
	federal licenses, it may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which would harm the reputation of the Trust or its Sponsor, decrease the liquidity of the Trust,
	and have a material adverse effect on the price of the Shares. If the Sponsor decides to comply with such additional federal or state regulatory obligations and continue the Trust, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory compliance
	steps may result in extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust, possibly affecting an investment in the Shares in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, the Trust and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain
	federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to money service businesses money transmitters and businesses involved in digital currency business activity. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such requirements, the Sponsor will
	act to dissolve and liquidate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders.




	Regulatory changes or interpretations could cause the Trust and the Sponsor to register and comply with new regulations, resulting in
	potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust.




	Current and future legislation, CFTC and SEC rulemaking and
	other regulatory developments may impact the manner in which bitcoins are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoins may be classified by the CFTC as commodity interests under the CEA or may be classified
	by the SEC as securities under U.S. federal securities laws. As of the date of this prospectus, the Sponsor is not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoins as a commodity interest or a security. Although several
	U.S. federal district courts have recently held for certain purposes that bitcoins are currency or a form of money, these rulings are not definitive and the Sponsor and the Trust cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact
	the treatment of bitcoins under the law. In the face of such developments, the required registrations and compliance steps may result in extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust. If the Sponsor decides to terminate the Trust in response to
	the changed regulatory circumstances, the Trust may be dissolved or liquidated at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders.


	To the
	extent that bitcoins are deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity interest under the CEA, the Trust and the Sponsor may be subject to additional regulation under the CEA and CFTC regulations. The Sponsor may be required to
	register as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor with the CFTC and become a member of the National Futures Association and may be subject to additional regulatory requirements with respect to the Trust, including disclosure and
	reporting requirements. These additional requirements may result in extraordinary, recurring and/or nonrecurring expenses of the Trust, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Shares. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such
	additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor will terminate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders.


	To the extent that bitcoins are deemed to fall within the definition of a security under U.S. federal securities laws, the Trust and the
	Sponsor may be subject to additional requirements under the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act. The Sponsor may be required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. Such additional registration may
	result in extraordinary, recurring and/or non-recurring expenses of the Trust, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Shares. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor
	will terminate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders.




	The treatment of the Trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes is uncertain.




	The Sponsor intends to take the position that the Trust will be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that
	the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, a

	pro rata

	portion of the Trusts income, gain, losses and deductions will flow through to each beneficial owner of Shares.

	Recent amendments to the Trust Agreement were intended to clarify the Trusts classification
	as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To eliminate any ambiguity that the Trust, since its formation, has been intended to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust petitioned for, and was
	granted on February 9, 2017, an order of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware reforming the Trust Agreement, retroactively to September 25, 2013 (the date of the original Trust Agreement), to conform to the amendments described in the
	preceding sentence. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) or a court might not agree that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust is seeking a ruling from the IRS
	that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the Trust will be successful in obtaining such a ruling.


	If the IRS were successful in asserting that the Trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust might be classified as a
	partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although due to the uncertain treatment of bitcoins for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as discussed below in U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesUncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal
	Income Tax Treatment of Bitcoins), there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different
	from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to the timing of recognition of gain or loss. In addition, tax information reports provided to Shareholders would be made in a different
	form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal
	income tax (currently at a maximum marginal rate of 35%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to Shareholders would be taxable as dividends to the extent of the Trusts current and accumulated earnings and
	profits (which, in the case of a non-U.S. Shareholder, generally would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate (or a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty)).




	The treatment of bitcoins for U.S. federal income tax purposes is uncertain.




	As discussed in the section entitled U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesUncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax
	Treatment of Bitcoins below, the Trust intends to take the position that each beneficial owner of Shares generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the bitcoins held in the Trust.
	Many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoins are uncertain, and the Sponsor does not intend to request a ruling from the IRS on these issues. On March 25, 2014, the IRS released a notice (the Notice),
	which discusses certain aspects of the treatment of virtual currencies, such as bitcoins, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Notice, the IRS stated that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) bitcoins are property that is
	not currency and (ii) bitcoins may be held as capital assets. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not alter its position with respect to bitcoins in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the Notice. In
	addition, legislation has been introduced that would, if enacted, cause bitcoins to be treated as currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If bitcoins were properly treated as currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, gains recognized on
	the disposition of bitcoins would constitute ordinary income, and losses recognized on the disposition of bitcoins could be subject to special reporting requirements applicable to reportable transactions.


	The Notice does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoins, including: (i) whether
	bitcoins are properly treated as commodities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) whether bitcoins are properly treated as collectibles for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (iii) the proper method of
	determining a holders holding period and tax basis for bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices; and (iv) whether and how a holder of bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices may designate, for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes, which of the bitcoins is transferred in a subsequent sale, exchange or other disposition.


	Prospective
	investors are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the substantial uncertainty regarding the tax consequences of an investment in bitcoins.

	Future developments in the tax treatment of bitcoins could adversely affect an
	investment in the Shares.




	The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (NYDTF) has issued guidance regarding
	the application of New York State tax law to virtual currencies such as bitcoins. The NYDTF determined that New York State would follow the Notice with respect to the treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoins for state income tax purposes.
	Furthermore, the NYDTF took the position that virtual currencies such as bitcoin are a form of intangible property, with the result that the purchase and sale of bitcoins for fiat currency is not subject to New York state sales tax
	(although exchanges of bitcoin for other goods and services may be subject to sales tax under barter transaction treatment). The New Jersey Division of Taxation has issued similar guidance, while the taxing authorities of various states other than
	New York and New Jersey have issued guidance exempting the acquisition and/or disposition of bitcoins from sales tax. It is unclear what further guidance on the treatment of bitcoins for state tax purposes may be issued in the future. If a state
	does not follow the Notice, such states treatment of bitcoins may have negative consequences, including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or the imposition of a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of
	bitcoins generally. Any such treatment may have a negative effect on prices of bitcoins in the Bitcoin Exchange Market and may adversely affect the value of the Shares.


	The treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoins for tax purposes by non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from the treatment of virtual
	currencies by the IRS or the NYDTF. If a foreign jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of bitcoin users imposes onerous tax burdens on bitcoin users, or imposes sales or value-added tax on purchases and sales of bitcoins for fiat
	currency, such actions could result in decreased demand for bitcoins in such jurisdiction, which could adversely affect the price of bitcoins and the value of the Shares.






	Risk Factors Related to Potential Conflicts of Interest





	Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust. The Sponsor and its affiliates have no
	fiduciary duties to the Trust and its Shareholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of the Trust and its Shareholders.




	The Sponsor will manage the business and affairs of the Trust. Conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, including
	the Index Provider, the Authorized Participants and Genesis, who serves as a Liquidity Provider, on the one hand, and the Trust and its Shareholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the
	interests of its affiliates over the Trust and its Shareholders. These potential conflicts include, among others, the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsor has no fiduciary duties to, and is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than, the Trust and its Shareholders in resolving conflicts of interest;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Trust has agreed to indemnify the Sponsor and its affiliates pursuant to the Trust Agreement;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsor is responsible for allocating its own limited resources among different clients and potential future business ventures, to each of which it owes fiduciary duties;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsors staff also services affiliates of the Sponsor and their respective clients and cannot devote all of its, or their, respective time or resources to the management of the business and affairs of the
	Trust;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust;




	 




	 


	


	 


	There is an absence of arms-length negotiation with respect to certain terms of the Trust, and, where applicable, there has been no independent due diligence conducted with respect to this offering;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Barry E. Silbert, the Chief Executive Officer of the Sponsor, acts as an advisor to the Index Provider and owns less than approximately 1.0% of the Index Providers voting equity;




	 


	34







	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	Digital Currency Group, Inc. is (i) the sole member and parent company of the Sponsor and Genesis, which as of the date of this prospectus, is the only acting Liquidity Provider, (ii) the owner of less than 3%
	of the Index Providers voting equity either directly or through warrants, (iii) a minority interest holder in the Custodian, representing less than 1.0% of its equity, (iv) a minority interest holder in Coinbase, which operates the GDAX,
	representing approximately 0.5% of its equity and (v) a minority interest holder in Paxos, which operates itBit, representing less than 0.3% of its equity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsor decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for the Trust; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	While the Index does not currently utilize data from over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms, it may decide to include pricing data from such markets or platforms in the future, which could include data from
	Genesis, a Liquidity Provider and affiliate of the Trust.




	By investing in the Shares, investors agree and consent to the
	provisions set forth in the Trust Agreement. See Description of the Trust DocumentsDescription of the Trust Agreement.


	For a further discussion of the conflicts of interest among the Sponsor, Authorized Participants, Liquidity Providers, Index Provider,
	Custodian, Trust and others, see Conflicts of Interest.




	Affiliates of the Sponsor may invest in or trade bitcoin
	without regard to the interests of the Trust or its Shareholders.




	Affiliates of the Sponsor have substantial direct investments in
	bitcoins. Such affiliates of the Sponsor are permitted to manage such investments, taking into account their own interests, without regard to the interests of the Trust or its Shareholders. Affiliates of the Sponsor may obtain exposure to bitcoin
	through investment in the Shares.


	To the extent that any substantial investment in bitcoins is initiated, materially increased or
	materially reduced, such investment can affect the Bitcoin Index Price. The initiation of, or material increases in, a substantial investment in bitcoin may result in an increase in the Bitcoin Index Price. A material reduction in a substantial
	investment may result in a decrease in the Bitcoin Index Price, having a negative impact on the value of Shares. See Conflicts of InterestProprietary Trading/Other Clients.




	Shareholders cannot be assured of the Sponsors continued services, the discontinuance of which may be detrimental to the Trust.




	Shareholders cannot be assured that the Sponsor will be willing or able to continue to serve as sponsor to the Trust for any
	length of time. If the Sponsor discontinues its activities on behalf of the Trust and a substitute sponsor is not appointed, the Trust will terminate and liquidate the bitcoins held by the Trust.


	Appointment of a substitute sponsor will not guarantee the Trusts continued operation, successful or otherwise. Because a substitute
	sponsor may have no experience managing a digital currency financial vehicle, a substitute sponsor may not have the experience, knowledge or expertise required to ensure that the Trust will operate successfully or to continue to operate at all.
	Therefore, the appointment of a substitute sponsor may not necessarily be beneficial to the Trust or an investment in the Shares and the Trust may terminate. See Conflicts of InterestThe Sponsor.




	The Custodian owes no fiduciary duties to the Trust or the Shareholders, is not required to act in their best interest and could resign
	or be removed by the Sponsor, which could trigger early termination of the Trust.




	The Custodian is not a trustee for, and owes no
	fiduciary duties to, the Trust or the Shareholders. In addition, the Custodian has no duty to continue to act as the custodian of the Trust. The Custodian can terminate


	 


	35







	Table of Contents



	its role as custodian for any reason whatsoever upon the notice period provided under the Custodian Agreement. The Custodian may also be terminated. If the Custodian resigns or is removed without
	replacement, the Trust will dissolve in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.




	The Custodians ability to adopt
	technology in response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the Trusts bitcoins.




	The
	history of the Bitcoin Exchange Market has shown that bitcoin exchanges and large holders of bitcoins must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard client accounts. While the Custodian is required in its agreement to safeguard
	the Custodial Coins from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack, its ability to do so is based upon known technology and threats. As technological change occurs, the security threats to the Custodial
	Coins will likely adapt and previously unknown threats may emerge. Furthermore, the Sponsor believes that the Trust may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the Trusts assets grows. To the extent that the Custodian
	is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, the Custodial Coins may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Shares or result in loss of the
	Trusts assets.




	Shareholders may be adversely affected by the lack of independent advisers representing investors in the
	Trust.




	The Sponsor has consulted with counsel, accountants and other advisers regarding the formation and operation of the Trust.
	No counsel has been appointed to represent an investor in connection with the offering of the Shares. Accordingly, an investor should consult his, her or its own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in the
	Shares. Lack of such consultation may lead to an undesirable investment decision with respect to investment in the Shares.




	Shareholders may be adversely affected by lack of regular shareholder meetings and no voting rights.




	Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have limited voting rights and the Trust will not have regular Shareholder meetings and take no part in
	the management or control of the Trust. Accordingly, Shareholders do not have the right to authorize actions, appoint service providers or take other actions as may be taken by shareholders of other trusts or companies where shares carry such
	rights. Shareholders, may, however, remove and replace the Sponsor by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Shares. The Shareholders limited voting rights, however, give almost all control under the Trust Agreement to the
	Sponsor and the Trustee. The Sponsor may take actions in the operation of the Trust that may be adverse to the interests of Shareholders. The Sponsors operation of the Trust could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	Proceeds received by the Trust from the issuance and sale of Baskets will consist of bitcoin deposits. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, during
	the life of the Trust such bitcoins will only be (i) owned by the Trust and held by the Custodian, (ii) disbursed (or converted to U.S. Dollars, if necessary) to pay the Trusts expenses, (iii) distributed to Authorized
	Participants or Liquidity Providers in connection with the redemption of Baskets and (iv) liquidated in the event that the Trust terminates or as otherwise required by law or regulation.


	The Trust will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Shares by the selling shareholders.

	OVERVIEW OF THE BITCOIN INDUSTRY AND MARKET




	Introduction to Bitcoins and the Bitcoin Network



	A bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, digital protocol platform using
	cryptographic security that is known as the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the Blockchain, and the source code that comprises the basis for the
	cryptography and digital protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoins can be used to pay for goods and
	services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. Dollar, at rates determined on Bitcoin Exchanges or in individual end-user-to-end-user transactions under a barter system. See Uses of BitcoinsBitcoin Exchange
	Market below.


	Bitcoins are stored or reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the Blockchain,
	which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all bitcoins in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the
	Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns them. The Bitcoin Network and bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet
	listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network.


	The Blockchain is comprised of a digital file,
	downloaded and stored, in whole or in part, on all Bitcoin users software programs. The file includes all blocks that have been solved by miners and is updated to include new blocks as they are solved. See Bitcoin Mining and
	Creation of New Bitcoins below. As each newly solved block refers back to and connects with the immediately prior solved block, the addition of a new block adds to the Blockchain in a manner similar to a new link being added to a
	chain. Because each new block records outstanding bitcoin transactions, and outstanding transactions are settled and validated through such recording, the Blockchain represents a complete, transparent and unbroken history of all transactions on the
	Bitcoin Network.


	Each bitcoin transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin Network and recorded in the Blockchain. Off-Blockchain
	transactions involve the transfer of control over, or ownership of, a specific digital wallet holding bitcoins, or of the reallocation of ownership of certain bitcoins in a pooled-ownership digital wallet, such as a digital wallet owned by a
	Bitcoin Exchange. Information and data regarding Off-Blockchain transactions is generally not publicly available in contrast to true bitcoin transactions, which are publicly recorded on the Blockchain. Off-Blockchain transactions are not truly
	bitcoin transactions in that they do not involve the transfer of transaction data on the Bitcoin Network and do not reflect a movement of bitcoins between addresses recorded in the Blockchain. Off-Blockchain transactions are subject to risks as any
	such transfer of bitcoin ownership is not protected by the protocol behind the Bitcoin Network or recorded in and validated through the Blockchain mechanism.


	The Bitcoin Network is decentralized and does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or
	determine the value of bitcoins. Rather, bitcoins are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a mining process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. The value of bitcoins is determined by the supply of
	and demand for bitcoins in the Bitcoin Exchange Market (and in private end-user-to-end-user transactions), as well as the number of merchants that accept them. As bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any users
	bitcoin software and bitcoins can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are little or no transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third-party service providers such as
	Bitcoin Exchanges and Bitcoin third-party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, bitcoins to or from fiat currency.

	The Bitcoin Network was initially contemplated in a white paper that also described Bitcoin and
	the operating software to govern the Bitcoin Network. The white paper was purportedly authored by Satoshi Nakamoto; however, no individual with that name has been reliably identified as bitcoins creator, and the general consensus is that the
	name is a pseudonym for the actual inventor or inventors. The first bitcoins were created in 2009 after Nakamoto released the Bitcoin Network source code (the software and protocol that created and launched the Bitcoin Network). Since its
	introduction, the Bitcoin Network has been under active development by a group of engineers known as core developers. As an open source project, bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority, although groups including
	MITs Media Lab work to organize the Bitcoin community and to develop and protect the Bitcoin Networks code.




	Overview of
	the Bitcoin Networks Operations




	In order to own, transfer or use bitcoins, a person generally must have internet access to
	connect to the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoin transactions between parties occur rapidly (typically between a few seconds and a few minutes) and may be made directly between end-users without the need for a third-party intermediary, although there are
	entities that provide third-party intermediary services. To prevent the possibility of double-spending a single bitcoin, each transaction is recorded, time stamped and publicly displayed in a block in the publicly available Blockchain.
	Thus, the Bitcoin Network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and downloaded in part or in whole by all users Bitcoin Network software programs as
	described below. This memorialization and verification against double-spending is accomplished through the bitcoin mining process, which adds blocks of data, including recent transaction information, to the Blockchain.




	Brief Description of Bitcoin Transfers




	Prior to engaging in bitcoin transactions, a user must first obtain a digital bitcoin wallet (analogous to a bitcoin account) in
	which to store bitcoins. A wallet can be obtained, among other ways, through an open-source software program that generates bitcoin addresses and enables users to engage in the transfer of bitcoins with other users. A user may install a
	bitcoin software program on its computer or mobile device that will generate a bitcoin wallet or, alternatively, a user may retain a third party to create a digital wallet to be used for the same purpose. There is no limit on the number of digital
	wallets a user can have, and each such wallet includes one or more unique addresses and a verification system for each address consisting of a public key and a private key, which are mathematically related.


	In a typical bitcoin transaction, the bitcoin recipient creates a new bitcoin address and directs the payor to send the payment to the address
	by providing the address, or public key, for the digital wallet to the payor who will initiate the transfer. This activity is analogous to a recipient providing an address in wire instructions to the payor so that cash may be wired to the
	recipients account. The payor approves the transfer to the address provided by the recipient by signing the transaction request from the recipient with the private key of the address from where the payor is transferring the
	bitcoins. The recipient does not make public its related private key or provide it to the payor, because the private key authorizes access to, and transfer of, the funds from the recipients digital wallet to other users. The process of signing
	the transaction is typically automated by the software that runs the payor and recipients digital wallet. The transfer is made from the payor to the recipients wallet and this transaction is validated by the Bitcoin Network.


	Information and data regarding Off-Blockchain transactions is generally not publicly available in contrast to true bitcoin transactions, which
	are publicly recorded on the Blockchain. Off-Blockchain transactions are not truly bitcoin transactions in that they do not involve the transfer of transaction data on the Bitcoin Network and do not reflect a movement of bitcoins between addresses
	recorded in the Blockchain. Off-Blockchain transactions are subject to risks as any such transfer of bitcoin ownership is not protected by the protocol behind the Bitcoin Network or recorded in and validated through the Blockchain mechanism.

	Summary of a Bitcoin Transaction




	In a bitcoin transaction between two parties, the following circumstances must be in place: (i) the party seeking to send bitcoins must
	have a digital wallet and the Bitcoin Network must recognize that digital wallet as having sufficient bitcoins for the spending transaction, (ii) the receiving party must have a digital wallet and (iii) the spending party must have
	internet access with which to send its spending transaction.


	Next, the receiving party must provide the spending party with its
	wallets digital address, an identifying series of 27 to 34 alphanumeric characters that represents the wallets routing number on the Bitcoin Network and allows the Blockchain to record the sending of bitcoins to that wallet. The
	receiving party can provide this address to the spending party in alphanumeric format or an encoded format such as a Quick Response Code (commonly known as a QR Code), which may be scanned by a smartphone or other device to quickly transmit the
	information.


	After the provision of the receiving wallets digital address, the spending party must enter the address into its
	bitcoin software program along with the number of bitcoins to be sent. The number of bitcoins to be sent will typically be agreed upon between the two parties based on a set number of bitcoins or an agreed upon conversion of the value of fiat
	currency to bitcoins. Most bitcoin software programs also allow, and often suggest, the payment of a transaction fee (also known as a miners fee). Transaction fees are not required to be included by many Bitcoin software programs, but, when
	they are included, they are paid by the spending party on top of the specified amount of bitcoins being sent in the transaction. Transaction fees, if any, are typically a fractional number of bitcoins (for example, 0.005 or 0.0005 bitcoins) and are
	automatically transferred by the Bitcoin Network to the bitcoin miner that solves and adds the block recording the spending transaction on the Blockchain.


	After the entry of the wallets digital address, the number of bitcoins to be sent and the transaction fees, if any, to be paid, the
	spending party will transmit the spending transaction. The transmission of the spending transaction results in the creation of a data packet by the spending partys bitcoin software program. The data packet includes data showing (i) the
	destination digital wallets address, (ii) the number of bitcoins being sent, (iii) the transaction fees, if any, and (iv) the spending partys digital signature, verifying the authenticity of the transaction. The data
	packet also includes references called inputs and outputs, which are used by the Blockchain to identify the source of the bitcoins being spent and record the flow of bitcoins from one transaction to the next transaction in
	which the bitcoins are spent. The digital signature exposes the spending partys digital wallet address and public key to the Bitcoin Network, though, for the receiving party, only its digital wallet address is revealed. The spending
	partys bitcoin software will transmit the data packet onto the decentralized Bitcoin Network, resulting in the propagation of the information among the software programs of Bitcoin users across the Bitcoin Network for eventual inclusion in the
	Blockchain. Typically, the data will spread to a vast majority of bitcoin miners within the course of less than one minute.


	As discussed
	in greater detail below in Bitcoin Mining and Creation of New Bitcoins, bitcoin miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the Blockchain. When a miner solves for a block, it creates that block,
	which includes data relating to (i) the solution to the block, (ii) a reference to the prior block in the Blockchain to which the new block is being added and (iii) all transactions that have occurred but have not yet been added to
	the Blockchain. The miner becomes aware of outstanding, unrecorded transactions through the data packet transmission and propagation discussed above. Typically, bitcoin transactions will be recorded in the next chronological block if the spending
	party has an internet connection and at least one minute has passed between the transactions data packet transmission and the solution of the next block. If a transaction is not recorded in the next chronological block, it is usually recorded
	in the next block thereafter.


	Bitcoin transactions that are micropayments (typically, less than 0.01 bitcoins) and that do not include
	transaction fees to miners are currently deprioritized for recording, meaning that, depending on bitcoin miner

	policies, these transactions may take longer to record than typical transactions if the transactions do not include a transaction fee. Additionally, transactions initiated by spending wallets
	with poor connections to the Bitcoin Network (i.e., few or poor quality connections to nodes or supernodes that relay transaction data) may be delayed in the propagation of their transaction data and, therefore, transaction recording on
	the Blockchain. Finally, to the extent that a miner chooses to limit the transactions it includes in a solved block (whether by the payment of transaction fees or otherwise), a transaction not meeting that miners criteria will not be included.


	To the extent that a transaction has not yet been recorded, there is a greater chance that the spending wallet can double-spend the
	bitcoins sent in the original transaction. If the next block solved is by an honest miner not involved in the attempt to double-spend bitcoin and if the transaction data for both the original and double-spend transactions have been propagated onto
	the Bitcoin Network, the transaction that is received with the earlier time stamp will be recorded by the solving miner, regardless of whether the double-spending transaction includes a larger transaction fee. If the double-spend transaction
	propagates to the solving miner and the original transaction has not, then the double-spending has a greater chance of success. As a result of the high difficulty in successfully initiating a double-spend without the assistance of a coordinated
	attack, the probability of success for a double-spend transaction attempt is limited. See Double-Spending and the Bitcoin Network Confirmation System and Forms of Attack Against the Bitcoin Network below.


	Upon the addition of a block included in the Blockchain, the bitcoin software program of both the spending party and the receiving party will
	show confirmation of the transaction on the Blockchain and reflect an adjustment to the bitcoin balance in each partys digital wallet, completing the bitcoin transaction. Typically, bitcoin software programs will automatically check for and
	display additional confirmations of six or more blocks in the Blockchain. See Double-Spending and the Bitcoin Network Confirmation System below.



	Cryptographic Security Used in the Bitcoin Network





	Public and Private Keys




	All transactions on the Bitcoin Network are secured using public-key cryptography, a technique which underpins many online transactions.
	Public-key cryptography works by generating two mathematically related keys (one a public key and the other a private key). One of these, the private key, is retained in the individuals wallet and the other key is made public and serves as the
	address to which a bitcoin can be transferred and from which money can be transferred by the owner of the bitcoin wallet. In the case of bitcoin transactions the public key is an address (a string of letters and numbers) that is used to encode
	payments, which can then only be retrieved with its associated private key, which is used to authorize the transaction. In other words, the payor uses his private key to approve any transfers to a recipients account. Users on the Bitcoin
	Network can confirm that the user signed the transaction with the appropriate private key, but cannot reverse engineer the private key from the signature.




	Double-Spending and the Bitcoin Network Confirmation System




	To ensure the integrity of bitcoin transactions from the recipients side (i.e., to prevent double-spending by a payor), every bitcoin
	transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin Network and recorded in the Blockchain through the mining process (defined below), which time-stamps the transaction and memorializes the change in the ownership of the bitcoin(s) transferred.
	Adding a block to the Blockchain requires bitcoin miners (defined below) to exert significant computational effort to verify it is a valid transaction. Requiring this computational effort, or proof of work, prevents a
	malicious actor from either adding fraudulent blocks to generate bitcoins (i.e., counterfeit bitcoins) or overwriting existing valid blocks to reverse its prior transactions.


	A transaction in bitcoins between two parties is recorded in the Blockchain in a block only if that block is accepted as valid by a majority
	of the nodes on the Bitcoin Network. Validation of a block is achieved by confirming the cryptographic hash value included in the blocks solution and by the blocks addition to the


	 


	41







	Table of Contents



	longest confirmed Blockchain on the Bitcoin Network. For a transaction, inclusion in a block on the Blockchain constitutes a confirmation of the bitcoin transaction. As each block
	contains a reference to the immediately preceding block, additional blocks appended to and incorporated into the Blockchain constitute additional confirmations of the transactions in such prior blocks, and a transaction included in a block for the
	first time is confirmed once against double-spending. The layered confirmation process makes changing historical blocks (and reversing transactions) exponentially more difficult the further back one goes in the Blockchain. Bitcoin Exchanges and
	users can set their own threshold as to how many confirmations are required until funds from the transferor are considered valid. However, statistically speaking, a transaction is virtually final after six confirmations as it would be extremely
	difficult to challenge the validity of the transaction at that point.


	At this point in the evolution of the Bitcoin Network, bitcoin
	transactions are considered irreversible. Once a transaction appears in the Blockchain, no one has the authority to reverse it. If someone were to attempt to undo a past transaction in a block recorded on the Blockchain, such individual would have
	to exert tremendous processing power in a series of complicated transactions that may not be achieved at this point in the Bitcoin Networks development.



	Bitcoin Mining and Creation of New Bitcoins





	Mining Process




	The
	process by which bitcoins are created and bitcoin transactions are verified is called mining. To begin mining, a user, or miner, can download and run a mining client, which, like regular Bitcoin Network software programs, turns the
	users computer into a node on the Bitcoin Network that validates blocks. Bitcoin transactions are recorded in new blocks that are added to the Blockchain and new bitcoins being issued to the miners. Miners, through the use of the
	bitcoin software program, engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the Blockchain and thereby confirm bitcoin transactions included in that blocks data.


	Most bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks added to the Blockchain. Each block contains the details of some or all of the most recent
	transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks, as well as a record of the award of bitcoins to the miner who added the new block. In order to add blocks to the Blockchain, a miner must map an input data set (i.e., the Blockchain, plus a
	block of the most recent Bitcoin Network transactions and an arbitrary number called a nonce) to a desired output data set of a predetermined length (the hash value) using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm. Each unique
	block can only be solved and added to the Blockchain by one miner; therefore, all individual miners and mining pools on the Bitcoin Network are engaged in a competitive process of constantly increasing their computing power to improve their
	likelihood of solving for new blocks. As more miners join the Bitcoin Network and its processing power increases, the Bitcoin Network adjusts the complexity of the block-solving equation to maintain a predetermined pace of adding a new block to the
	Blockchain approximately every ten minutes.


	A miners proposed block is added to the Blockchain once a majority of the nodes on the
	Bitcoin Network confirms the miners work. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded bitcoins for their effort plus any transaction fees paid by transferors whose transactions are recorded in the
	block. This reward system is the method by which new bitcoins enter into circulation to the public.




	Incentives for Mining




	As noted above, miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded bitcoins for their
	effort. Given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the Bitcoin Network, current miners are required to invest in expensive mining devices with adequate processing power to hash at a competitive rate. The first wave of mining
	devices used central processing units (CPUs) used in standard home computers. Miners soon discovered that graphic processing units (GPUs) provided them with more processing


	 


	42







	Table of Contents



	power and the second wave of miners entered the Bitcoin Network. Today, the Bitcoin Network is well into a third wave of mining devices which consist of mining computers that are designed solely
	for mining purposes. Such devices include ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) machines built specifically for bitcoin mining by specialized companies like Bitman Technologies. These new computers are significantly more expensive than
	standard home computers. Miners also incur substantial electricity costs in order to continuously power and cool their devices while solving for a new block.


	The Bitcoin Network is designed in such a way that the reward for adding new blocks to the Blockchain decreases over time and the production
	(and reward) of bitcoins will eventually cease. Once such incentive mechanism ceases to be profitable, miners will only have transaction fees to incentivize them and as a result, it is expected that miners will need to be better compensated with
	higher transaction fees to ensure that there is adequate incentive for them to continue mining.




	Mining Pools




	The significant increase in the number of miners and the increasing in mining capacity have radically increased the difficulty of finding a
	valid hash since the first block was mined. In some respects, hashing is akin to a mathematical lottery, and miners that have devices with greater processing power (i.e., the ability to make more hash calculations per second) are more likely to be
	successful miners. Currently, the likelihood that an individual acting alone will be able to be awarded a bitcoin is extremely low. As a result, mining pools have developed in which multiple miners act cohesively and combine their
	processing power to solve blocks. When a pool solves a new block, the pool operator receives the bitcoin and, after taking a nominal fee, splits the resulting reward among the pool participants based on the processing power they each contributed to
	solve for such block. Mining pools provide participants with access to smaller, but steadier and more frequent, bitcoin payouts. As of April 28, 2017, the three largest identifiable mining pools were AntPool, F2Pool and BitFury, which, when
	aggregated, represented approximately 37% of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network (as calculated by determining the percentage of blocks mined by each such pool over the prior four days). As of April 28, 2017, the ten largest identifiable
	pools were AntPool, F2Pool, BitFury, BTC.TOP, BTCC Pool, Bixin, SlushPool, BTC.com, Via BTC and BW.COM, which accounted for approximately 81% of the mining processing power on the Bitcoin Network.



	Mathematically Controlled Supply



	The
	supply of new bitcoins is mathematically controlled in a manner so that the number of bitcoins grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre-set schedule. The number of bitcoins awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved after every 210,000
	blocks are added to the Blockchain. Currently, the fixed reward for solving a new block is 12.5 bitcoins per block and this is expected to decrease by half to become 6.25 bitcoins after the next 210,000 blocks have entered the Bitcoin Network, which
	is expected to be July 2020. This deliberately controlled rate of bitcoin creation means that the number of bitcoins in existence will increase at a controlled rate until the number of bitcoins in existence reaches the pre-determined 21 million
	bitcoins. As of April 28, 2017, approximately 16.30 million bitcoins have been mined, and estimates of when the 21 million bitcoin limitation will be reached range up to the year 2140.



	Modifications to the Bitcoin Protocol



	Bitcoin is an open source project (i.e., a product whose source code is freely available to the public and that utilizes crowdsourcing to
	identify possible issues, problems and defects) with no official developer or group of developers that controls the Bitcoin Network. However, the Bitcoin Networks development is overseen by a core group of developers including those employed
	by MIT Media Labs Digital Currency Initiative (the Core Developers). The Core Developers are able to access and can alter the Bitcoin Network source code and, as a result, they are responsible for quasi-official releases of updates
	and other changes to the Bitcoin Networks source code. The release of updates to the Bitcoin Networks source code does not guarantee that the updated


	 


	43







	Table of Contents



	will be automatically adopted. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the bitcoin source code by downloading the proposed modification of the Bitcoin Networks source code. A
	modification of the Bitcoin Networks source code is only effective with respect to the bitcoin users and miners that download it. If a modification is accepted only by a percentage of users and miners, a division in the Bitcoin Network will
	occur such that one network will run the pre-modification source code and the other network will run the modified source code. Such a division is known as a fork in the Bitcoin Network. See Risk FactorsRisk Factors Related to
	the Bitcoin Network and BitcoinsThe acceptance of Bitcoin Network software patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage of the users and miners in the Bitcoin Network could result in a fork in the
	Blockchain, resulting in the operation of two separate networks. Consequently, as a practical matter, a modification to the source code only becomes part of the Bitcoin Network if accepted by participants collectively having a majority of the
	processing power on the Bitcoin Network.


	Core Development of the Bitcoin source code has increasingly focused on modifications of the
	Bitcoin protocol to allow non-financial and next generation uses (sometimes referred to as Bitcoin 2.0 projects). These uses include smart contracts and distributed registers built into, built atop or pegged alongside the Blockchain. For example,
	the white paper for Blockstream, a company of which Core Developers Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell are a part, calls for the use of pegged sidechains to develop programming environments that are built within block chain ledgers that
	can interact with and rely on the security of the Bitcoin Network and Blockchain, while remaining independent thereof. The Trusts activities will not directly relate to Bitcoin 2.0 projects, though Bitcoin 2.0 projects may utilize bitcoins as
	tokens for the facilitation of their non-financial uses, thereby potentially increasing demand for bitcoins and the utility of the Bitcoin Network as a whole. Conversely, Bitcoin 2.0 projects that operate and are built within the Blockchain may
	increase the data flow on the Bitcoin Network and could either bloat the size of the Blockchain or slow confirmation times. At this time, Bitcoin 2.0 projects remain in early stages and have not been materially integrated into the
	Blockchain or Bitcoin Network.



	Bitcoin Value



	Bitcoins are not a fiat currency (i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national
	organization) and are not backed by hard assets or other credit. As a result, the value of bitcoins is currently determined by the value that various market participants place on bitcoins through their transactions.




	Exchange Valuation




	Due to the peer-to-peer framework of the Bitcoin Network and the protocols thereunder, transferors and recipients of bitcoins are able to
	determine the value of the bitcoins transferred by mutual agreement or barter with respect to their transactions. As a result, the most common means of determining the value of a bitcoin is by surveying one or more Bitcoin Exchanges where bitcoins
	are bought, sold and traded. On each Bitcoin Exchange, bitcoins are traded with publicly disclosed valuations for each transaction, measured by one or more fiat currencies such as the U.S. Dollar or the Chinese Yuan.


	Historically, a large percentage of the global bitcoin trading volume occurred on self-reported, unregulated exchanges located in China. In
	January 2017, the largest China-based Bitcoin ExchangesBTCC, Huobi and OKCoinadjusted their terms to pause or limit loan and borrowing services in response to informal guidance received from the Peoples Bank of China concerning the
	creation of tighter anti-money laundering and foreign exchange controls. On January 24, 2017, these exchanges introduced a 0.2% fixed-rate transaction fee for all bitcoin buy and sell orders in response to added regulatory pressure by the
	Peoples Bank of China. In February 2017, Chinas smaller bitcoin exchanges, including BTC Trade, BTC100, CHBTC, Dahonghuo, Yuanboa and BitBays also imposed or increased trading fees on their respective exchanges. In the subsequent weeks,
	BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin halted bitcoin withdrawals. These events have substantially reduced the volume traded on Chinese exchanges and changed the global liquidity profile for bitcoins.

	Table of Contents



	For example, from May 10, 2015 to January 24, 2017, the three primary Chinese Bitcoin
	Exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, reported a total trade volume of approximately 1.35 billion bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of 2.16 million bitcoins, comprising more than 95% of the global exchange-traded volume based on data from the
	Index Provider. During this period, the exchanges that comprised the Index, including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), OKCoin and Kraken (which was only included in the Index on the day of May 10, 2015), reported
	a total trade volume of 33.03 million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately 53,000 bitcoins, accounting for approximately 2.3% of the global exchange-traded volume and 78.5% of the US dollar-denominated trade volume.


	However, from January 25, 2017 to April 28, 2017, following the introduction of fixed-rate transaction fees in response to added regulatory
	pressure by the Peoples Bank of China, the three primary Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges, BTCC, Huobi, and OKCoin, reported a total trade volume of approximately 2.12 million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately 22,500
	bitcoins, comprising only 20.9% of the global exchange-traded volume based on data from the Index Provider. During this period, the exchanges that comprised the Index, including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), itBit,
	and OKCoin (which was removed from the Index on February 17, 2017), reported a total trade volume of approximately 3.78 million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of nearly 42,000 bitcoins, accounting for 37.3% of the global exchange-traded
	volume and 68.5% of the US dollar-denominated trade volume.


	Similar to other currency pairs, such as Euro to bitcoin, movements in pricing
	on the Chinese exchanges are generally in-line with U.S. Dollar-denominated exchanges. For example, based on data from the Index Provider, from May 10, 2015 to April 28, 2017, the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price on the three primary Chinese
	Yuan-denominated exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, differed from the Bitcoin Index Price by only 2.1% on average.




	The Index
	and the Bitcoin Index Price




	The Trust values its bitcoins for operational purposes by reference to the Bitcoin Index Price. The
	Bitcoin Index Price is the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index, calculated at 4:00 p.m., New York time on each business day. The Index Provider develops, calculates and publishes the Index on a continuous basis using the volume-weighted
	price at trading venues, as selected by the Index Provider.


	If the Index becomes unavailable, or if the Sponsor determines in good faith
	that the Index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Index Provider in order to obtain the Bitcoin Index Price. If after such contact the Index remains unavailable or the Sponsor
	continues to believe in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price, then the Administrator will use the following cascading set of rules to calculate the Bitcoin Index Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sponsor will
	employ the below rules sequentially and in the order presented below, should one or more specific rule(s) fail:


	 




	 


	1.


	Bitcoin Index Price = The price set by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Index is a U.S. Dollar-denominated composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin based on the
	volume-weighted price at trading venues selected by the Index Provider. Trading venues used to calculate the Index may include Bitcoin Exchanges, over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms. To ensure that the Index Providers trading
	venue selection process is impartial, the Index Provider considers depth of liquidity, compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, data availability, U.S. domicile and acceptance of U.S. Dollar deposits. The Index Provider
	conducts a quarterly review of these criteria.




	In the calculation of the Bitcoin Index Price, the Index Provider cleanses
	the trade data and compiles it in such a manner as to algorithmically reduce the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading. This is accomplished by adjusting the weight of each input based on price deviation relative to the observable set of
	data for the relevant trading venue, as well as recent and long-term trading volume at each venue relative to the observable set for the relevant trading venues. The Index Provider reduces the weighting


	 


	45







	Table of Contents



	of data inputs as they get further from the mean price across the trading venues and ultimately excludes any trade with a price that deviates beyond a certain predetermined threshold level from
	the mean. In addition, the Index groups trade bursts, or movements during off-peak trading hours, on any given venue into single data inputs, which reduces the potentially erratic price movements caused by small, individual orders. The Index
	Provider formally reevaluates the weighting algorithm quarterly, but maintains discretion to change the way in which the Index is calculated based on its periodic review or in extreme circumstances. The Index Provider does not currently include data
	from over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms. Over-the-counter data is not currently included because of the potential for trades to include a significant premium or discount paid for larger liquidity, which creates an uneven comparison
	relative to more active markets. There is also a higher potential for over-the-counter transactions to not be arms-length, and thus not be representative of a true market price. Bitcoin derivative markets are also not currently included as the
	markets remain relatively thin. The Index Provider will consider International Organization of Securities Commissions principles for financial benchmarks and the management of trading venues of bitcoin derivatives when considering inclusion of
	over-the-counter or derivative-platform data in the future.


	The Bitcoin Index Price is calculated by applying the weighting algorithm to
	the price and volume of all inputs for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. To measure volume data and trading halts, the Index Provider monitors trading activity and regards as eligible
	those Bitcoin Exchanges that it determines represent a substantial portion of U.S. Dollar-denominated trading over a sustained period on a platform without a significant history of trading disruptions. The Index Provider maintains a monitoring
	system that tests for these criteria on an ongoing basis.


	The description of the Index is based on information publicly available at the
	Index Providers website at https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/.


	None of the information on the Index Providers websites is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.




	If the Index becomes unavailable, or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin value, then
	the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Index Provider to obtain the Bitcoin Index Price directly from the Index Provider. If after such contact, the Index remains unavailable or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the
	Index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Bitcoin Index Price.


	 




	 


	2.


	Bitcoin Index Price = The volume-weighted average bitcoin price for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date as calculated based upon the volume-weighted average
	bitcoin prices of the Major Bitcoin Exchanges (as defined below) as published by an alternative third partys public data feed that is reasonably reliable as determined by the Sponsor (Second Source). Major Bitcoin
	Exchanges are those Bitcoin Exchanges that are online, trade on a 24-hour basis and make transaction price and volume data publicly available. Subject to the next sentence, if the Second Source becomes unavailable (for example, data sources
	from the Second Source for bitcoin prices become unavailable, unwieldy or otherwise impractical for use), or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Second Source does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will, on a best
	efforts basis, contact the Second Source in an attempt to obtain the relevant data. If after such contact the Second Source remains unavailable or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Second Source does not reflect an accurate
	bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Bitcoin Index Price.

	Bitcoin Index Price = The volume-weighted average bitcoin price as calculated by dividing (i) the U.S.
	Dollar value of the bitcoin transactions on the Major Bitcoin Exchanges by (ii) the total number of bitcoins traded on the Major Bitcoin Exchanges, in each case for the 24-hour period from 4:00 p.m., New York time (or as soon as practicable
	thereafter) on the business day prior to the

	valuation date to 4:00 p.m., New York time (or as soon as practicable thereafter) on the valuation date as published by a third partys public data feed that is reasonably reliable as
	determined by the Sponsor, subject to the requirement that such data is calculated based upon a volume-weighted average bitcoin price obtained from the Major Bitcoin Exchanges (Third Source). Subject to the next sentence, if the Third
	Source becomes unavailable (for example, data sources from the Third Source become unavailable, unwieldy or otherwise impractical for use), or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Third Source does not reflect an accurate bitcoin value,
	then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Third Source in an attempt to obtain the relevant data. If after such contact the Third Source remains unavailable or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Third Source
	does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Bitcoin Index Price.




	 




	 


	4.


	Bitcoin Index Price = The volume-weighted average bitcoin price as calculated by dividing (i) the U.S. Dollar value of the bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchanges (as defined below) by (ii) the
	total number of bitcoins traded on the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchanges, in each case for the 24-hour period from 4:00 p.m., New York time (or as soon as practicable thereafter) on the business day prior to the valuation date to 4:00 p.m., New York time
	(or as soon as practicable thereafter) on the valuation date. A Bitcoin Benchmark Exchange is a Bitcoin Exchange that represents at least 25% of the aggregate U.S. Dollar-denominated trading volume of the bitcoin market during the
	last 30 consecutive calendar days and that to the knowledge of the Sponsor is in substantial compliance with the laws, rules and regulations, including any anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures, of such Bitcoin Exchanges
	applicable jurisdiction; provided that if there are fewer than three such Bitcoin Exchanges, then the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchanges will include such Bitcoin Exchange or Bitcoin Exchanges that meet the above-described requirements as well as one or
	more additional Bitcoin Exchanges, selected by the Sponsor, that have had monthly trading volume of at least 50,000 bitcoins during the last 30 consecutive calendar days and that to the knowledge of the Sponsor is in substantial compliance with the
	laws, rules and regulations, including any anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures, of such Bitcoin Exchanges applicable jurisdiction.




	The Sponsor will review the composition of the exchanges that comprise the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchanges at the beginning of each month, or more
	frequently if necessary, in order to ensure the accuracy of its composition.


	Subject to the next sentence, if one or more of the Bitcoin
	Benchmark Exchanges become unavailable (for example, data sources from the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchanges of bitcoin prices become unavailable, unwieldy or otherwise impractical for use), or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Bitcoin
	Benchmark Exchange does not reflect an accurate bitcoin value, then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchange that is experiencing the service outages in an attempt to obtain the relevant data. If after such
	contact one or more of the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchanges remain unavailable or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Bitcoin Benchmark Exchange does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to
	determine the Bitcoin Index Price.

	Bitcoin Index Price = The Sponsor will use its best judgment to determine a good faith estimate of the Bitcoin Index Price.




	Data used for the above calculation of the Bitcoin Index Price is gathered by the Administrator or its delegate who calculates the Bitcoin
	Index Price each business day as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable. The Administrator will disseminate the Bitcoin Index Price on each business day.


	The Index Provider may change the trading venues that are used to calculate the Index, or otherwise change the way in which the Index is
	calculated at any time. The Index Provider does not have any obligation to consider

	Forms of Attack Against the Bitcoin Network





	Exploitation of Flaws in the Bitcoin Networks Source Code




	As with any other computer code, flaws in the Bitcoin Network source code have been exposed by certain malicious actors. Several errors and
	defects have been found and corrected, including those that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users information, or allowed users to create multiple views of the Bitcoin Network. Discovery of flaws in or exploitations of the
	source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money in contravention of known Bitcoin Network rules have been relatively rare. For example, in 2010, a hacker or group of hackers exploited a flaw in the Bitcoin Network source code
	that allowed them to generate 184 billion bitcoins in a transaction and send them to two digital wallet addresses. However, the bitcoin community and developers identified and reversed the manipulated transactions within approximately three
	hours, and the flaw was corrected with an updated version of the bitcoin protocol.


	The Core Developers, in conjunction with other
	developers and miners, work continuously in an attempt to ensure that flaws are quickly fixed or removed. Because open source codes rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems within the code, such flaws
	have been discovered and quickly corrected by the Core Developers or the bitcoin community.




	Greater than 50% of Network
	Computational Power




	A malicious actor can structure an attack after such actor gains control of more than half of the Bitcoin
	Networks processing power or hashrate. During May and June 2014, mining pool GHash.ios hashing power approached 50% of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. During a brief period in early June, the mining pool may have
	controlled in excess of one-half of the Bitcoin Networks processing power. Although no malicious activity or abnormal transaction recording was observed, the incident establishes that it is possible that a substantial mining pool may
	accumulate close to or more than a majority of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network.


	If a malicious actor acquired sufficient
	computational power necessary to control the Bitcoin Network, among other things, it would be able to reverse transactions and possibly engage in double-spending, or prevent some or all transactions from being confirmed, and prevent some or all
	other miners from mining any valid new blocks. A number of computer scientists and cryptographers believe that the immense collective processing power of the Bitcoin Network makes it impracticable for an actor to gain control of computers
	representing a majority of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network.




	Cancer Nodes




	Cancer nodes are fake bitcoin nodes, which a malicious actor sets up to either place connecting users on a separate network or disconnect them
	from all networks. This form of attack involves a malicious actor propagating cancer nodes to isolate certain users from the legitimate Bitcoin Network. A target user who is surrounded by such cancer nodes would be placed on a separate
	network, allowing the malicious actor to relay only blocks created by the separate network and thus opening the target user to double-spending attacks. By using cancer nodes, a malicious actor can also disconnect the target user from the
	bitcoin economy entirely by refusing to relay any blocks or transactions. Bitcoin software programs make these attacks more difficult by limiting the number of outbound connections through which users are connected to the Bitcoin Network.

	Double-Spending Risks




	A malicious actor may attempt to double spend bitcoins by manipulating the formation of the Blockchain rather than through control of the
	Bitcoin Network. Variations of this form of attack include the Finney attack, race attack and vector76 attack. In this type of attack, a miner creates a valid new block containing a double-spend transaction and
	schedules the release of such attack block so that it is added to the Blockchain before a target users legitimate transaction can be included in a block. All double-spend attacks require that the miner sequence and execute the steps of its
	attack with sufficient speed and accuracy. Typically, transactions that allow for a zero-confirmation acceptance tend to be prone to these types of attacks. Users and merchants can reduce the risk of a double-spend attack by waiting for multiple
	confirmations from the Bitcoin Network before settling a transaction. These attacks require extensive coordination and are very expensive. Accordingly, traders and merchants may still execute instantaneous, low-value transactions without
	confirmation, because it is generally agreed that a malicious miner would be unwilling to carry out a double-spend attack for low-value transactions. Users and merchants can take additional precautions by adjusting their Bitcoin Network software
	programs to connect only to other well-connected nodes and to disable incoming connections. These precautions reduce the risk of double-spend attacks involving manipulation of a targets connectivity to the Bitcoin Network (as is the case with
	vector76 and race attacks).



	Market Participants





	Miners




	Miners
	range from bitcoin enthusiasts to professional mining operations that design and build dedicated machines and data centers, but the vast majority of mining is now undertaken by mining pools. See Bitcoin Mining and Creation of New
	Bitcoins above.




	Investment and Speculative Sector




	This sector includes the investment and trading activities of both private and professional investors and speculators. These participants range
	from hedge funds such as Jersey-based Global Advisors (Jersey) Limited (GABI) to day-traders who invest in bitcoins by trading on Bitcoin Exchanges such as Luxembourg-based Bitstamp and Hong Kong-based Bitfinex. See Uses of
	BitcoinsBitcoin Exchange Market below.


	Historically, larger financial services institutions are publicly reported to have
	limited involvement in investment and trading in bitcoin. In December 2013, Wedbush Securities and Bank of America Merrill Lynch released preliminary research reports on Bitcoin as both a payment tool and investment vehicle. Additionally in
	December, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago released a primer on Bitcoin prepared by a senior economist. In early 2014, Fitch Ratings, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, PricewaterhouseCoopers, UBS Securities and Wedbush Securities, among others,
	released additional research reports analyzing Bitcoin on the basis of bitcoin value, technological innovation or payment system mechanics. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve Boards Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary
	Affairs released an analysis of the Bitcoin Networks transaction system and the Bitcoin Exchange Markets economics. In 2015, institutions including Alliance Bernstein, Goldman Sachs and KPMG issued further research reports. Additionally,
	institutions including Goldman Sachs, Citi, Nasdaq, Visa, Mastercard, CME Group, CIBC, Fortress Investment Group, J.P. Morgan, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and The PNC Financial Services Group made, or proposed to make,
	direct or indirect investments in bitcoins or the Bitcoin ecosystem. In 2016, this list grew to include ABN AMRO, Accenture, ASX Limited, BNP Paribas, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Deutsche Börse Group, ICAP, Santander InnoVentures, AXA
	Strategic Ventures, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Thomson Reuters, and Wells Fargo.




	Retail Sector




	The retail sector includes users transacting in direct peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions through the direct sending of bitcoins over the
	Bitcoin Network. The retail sector also includes transactions between consumers


	 


	49







	Table of Contents



	paying for goods or services from commercial or service businesses through direct transactions or third-party service providers such as BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin. BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin
	provide a merchant platform for instantaneous transactions whereby the consumer sends bitcoins to BitPay, Coinbase or GoCoin, which then provides either the bitcoins or the cash value thereof to the commercial or service business utilizing the
	platform. PayPal, Square and Shopify are examples of traditional merchant payment processors or merchant platforms that have also added bitcoin payment options for their merchant customers. Payment processing through Bitcoin typically reduces the
	transaction cost for merchants, relative to the costs paid for credit card transaction processing.




	Service Sector




	This sector includes companies that provide a variety of services including the buying, selling, payment processing and storing of bitcoins.
	Bitfinex, Bitstamp and OKCoin (U.S. Dollar equivalent) are three of the largest Bitcoin Exchanges in the world. BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin are large Bitcoin Exchanges based in China that primarily feature trading of bitcoins for Chinese Yuan. Coinbase
	is a multi-service financial institutions that provides digital wallets that store bitcoins for users and also serves as a retail gateway whereby users can purchase bitcoins for fiat currency. Coinbase, BitPay, BitPagos and GoCoin are examples of
	bitcoin payment processors that allow merchants to accept bitcoins as payment. As the Bitcoin Network continues to grow in acceptance, it is anticipated that service providers will expand the currently available range of services and that additional
	parties will enter the service sector for the Bitcoin Network. For example, bitcoin custodian Xapo was the first Bitcoin company to propose and provide a bitcoin debit card service that could permit more simple point-of-sale merchant transactions
	denominated in bitcoins. Meanwhile, BitGo, a bitcoin custodian and digital wallet, has pioneered the use of multi-signature storage as an enhanced security feature to retail and enterprise clients.



	Uses of Bitcoins





	Global Bitcoin
	Market




	Global trade in bitcoins consists of individual end-user-to-end-user transactions, together with facilitated exchange-based
	bitcoin trading. A limited market currently exists for bitcoin-based derivatives. There is currently no reliable data on the total number or demographic composition of users or miners on the Bitcoin Network.




	Bitcoin Exchange Market




	Online Bitcoin Exchanges represent a substantial percentage of bitcoin buying and selling activity and provide the most data with respect to
	prevailing valuations of bitcoins. Currently, there are several Bitcoin Exchanges operating worldwide. These exchanges include established exchanges such as Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange) and Bitfinex, which provide a number of
	options for buying and selling bitcoins. Among the Bitcoin Exchanges eligible for inclusion in the Index, domicile, regulation and legal compliance varies.


	The table below sets forth (1) the aggregate number of bitcoin trades made on the eight largest U.S. Dollar-denominated Bitcoin Exchanges by
	trade volume from May 10, 2015 to April 28, 2017 and (2) the market share of trade volume of each such Bitcoin Exchange.

	(1)


	Although the Bitcoin Exchange, LocalBitcoins, accounts for approximately 3% of the U.S. Dollar-BTC trade volume, the Sponsor does not consider it an appropriate Bitcoin Exchange to include in this analysis because it
	does not have an online electronic trading platform that allows for the prices and volumes of bitcoin traded to be reliably tracked.

	Headquartered in Hong Kong, Bitfinex is a trading platform for digital currencies, including bitcoin, that offers many advanced features such as margin and exchange trading and margin funding. Bitfinex is subject to
	know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws. The Sponsor does not believe Bitfinex has any state transmitter licenses or the New York State BitLicense scheme. Effective May 3, 2017, the Index Provider removed Bitfinex from the Index. See
	Risk FactorsRisk Factors Related to the Bitcoin Network and BitcoinThe Index is an average composite reference rate calculated using volume-weighted trading price data from various Bitcoin Exchanges chosen by the Index Provider.

	laundering laws. It holds 37 money transmitter licenses from various U.S. jurisdictions. The money transmitter services are only available in states where GDAX is either licensed to engage in money
	transmission, it has determined that no such license is currently required or licenses are not yet being issued with respect to GDAXs business. Wyoming, Hawaii and Minnesota are not currently supported by GDAX. According to the New York
	Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) website, GDAX has received a New York State BitLicense.

	itBit is a New York City-based, regulated global exchange that offers retail and institutional investors a platform to buy and sell bitcoins. itBit is subject to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws and is
	chartered under New York Banking Law by the NYDFS. As a New York trust company, itBit provides virtual currency exchange, custody and other services for all U.S. customers who are approved to trade through its New York virtual currency exchange.






	(8)


	OKCoin is a worldwide digital currency trading platform that was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Beijing, China. OKCoin


	is subject to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws. The Sponsor is not
	aware as to whether OKCoin has applied for a license under the New York State BitLicense scheme. OKCoin has both U.S. Dollar and Yuan-denominated exchanges. Effective February 17, 2017, the Index Provider removed OKCoin from the Index due to
	OKCoins implementation of a policy that currently suspends withdrawals from its exchange.




	Historically, a large
	percentage of the global bitcoin trading volume occurred on self-reported, unregulated exchanges located in China. In January 2017, the largest China-based Bitcoin ExchangesBTCC, Huobi and OKCoinadjusted their terms to pause or limit
	loan and borrowing services in response to informal guidance received from the Peoples Bank of China concerning the creation of tighter anti-money laundering and foreign exchange controls. On January 24, 2017, these exchanges introduced a 0.2%
	fixed-rate transaction fee for all bitcoin buy and sell orders in response to added regulatory pressure by the Peoples Bank of China. In February 2017, Chinas smaller bitcoin exchanges, including BTC Trade, BTC100, CHBTC, Dahonghuo,
	Yuanboa and BitBays, also imposed or increased trading fees on their respective exchanges. In the subsequent weeks, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin halted


	 


	51







	Table of Contents



	bitcoin withdrawals. These events have substantially reduced the volume traded on Chinese exchanges and changed the global liquidity profile for bitcoins.


	For example, from May 10, 2015 to January 24, 2017, the three primary Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, reported a total
	trade volume of approximately 1.35 billion bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of 2.16 million bitcoins, comprising more than 95% of the global exchange-traded volume based on data from the Index Provider. During this period, the exchanges
	that comprised the IndexBitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), OKCoin and Kraken (which was only included in the Index on the day of May 10, 2015)reported a total trade volume of 33.03 million bitcoins and an
	average daily trade volume of approximately 53,000 bitcoins, accounting for approximately 2.3% of the global exchange-traded volume and 78.5% of the US dollar-denominated trade volume.


	However, from January 25, 2017 to April 28, 2017, following the introduction of fixed-rate transaction fees in response to added regulatory
	pressure by the Peoples Bank of China, the three primary Chinese Bitcoin ExchangesBTCC, Huobi, and OKCoinreported a total trade volume of approximately 2.12 million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately 22,500
	bitcoins, comprising only 20.9% of the global exchange-traded volume, based on data from the Index Provider. During this period, the exchanges that comprised the IndexBitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), itBit and
	OKCoin (which was removed from the Index on February 17, 2017)reported a total trade volume of approximately 3.78 million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of nearly 42,000 bitcoins, accounting for 37.3% of the global exchange-traded
	volume and 68.5% of the U.S. Dollar-denominated trade volume.


	Similar to other currency pairs, such as Euro to bitcoin, movements in
	pricing on the Chinese exchanges are generally in-line with U.S. Dollar-denominated exchanges. For example, based on data from the Index Provider, from May 10, 2015 to April 28, 2017, the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price on the three primary
	Chinese Yuan-denominated exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, differed from the Bitcoin Index Price by only 2.1% on average.


	In
	addition to open online Bitcoin Exchanges, there are dark pools, which are bitcoin trading platforms that do not publicly report bitcoin trade data. Market participants have the ability to execute large block trades on a dark pool
	without revealing those trades and the related price data to the public Bitcoin Exchange Market, although any withdrawal from or deposit to a dark pool platform may be recorded on the Blockchain. Tradehill is an example of one such institutional
	dark pool, although it halted operations in August 2013 to allow for regulatory compliance upgrades. Genesis also operates a form of dark pool through a trading desk that buys and sells large blocks of bitcoins without publically reporting trade
	data. Informal dark pools are currently believed to exist, particularly among wholesale buyers of bitcoin and bitcoin mining groups that obtain large supplies of bitcoin through mining. Such informal dark pools function as a result of the
	peer-to-peer nature of the Bitcoin Network, which allows direct transactions between any seller and buyer. As the Bitcoin Exchange Market and bitcoin dark pools have a limited history, it is difficult to estimate the impact of dark pools on the
	Bitcoin Exchange Market.




	Goods and Services






	Bitcoins increasingly can be used to purchase goods and services, either online or at physical locations. While reliable data is not
	readily available on the retail and commercial market penetration of the Bitcoin Network, there are numerous indications of its increasing acceptance. For example, the bitcoin payment


	processors Bitpay and Coinbase publicly represent that
	over 100,000 businesses and organizations are now using those processors services to accept bitcoin payments. Additionally, PayPal announced that it would allow merchants that use its payment processing services to accept bitcoin. A wide range
	of industries now accept bitcoins as a form of payment, from newspapers


	to national sports franchises such as the Sacramento Kings. Additionally, for-profit internet-based companies such as Microsoft, WordPress, Reddit, Zynga, Expedia, Dell,
	TigerDirect.com and Overstock.com, as well as non-profit institutions such as Khan Academy and charitable organizations such as the Red Cross have received attention for accepting donations in bitcoins.






	End-User-to-End-User




	The bitcoin end-user-to-end-user ecosystem operates on a continuous, 24-hour per day basis. This is accomplished through decentralized
	peer-to-peer transactions between parties on a principal-to-principal basis.


	 


	52







	Table of Contents



	All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. Liquidity can change from time to time during the course of a 24-hour trading day. The Bitcoin Network
	rules that require transaction fees are generally not enforced, therefore transaction costs, if any, are negotiable between the parties and may vary widely, although, where transaction fees are included, they are paid by the sending party in a
	bitcoin transaction. These transactions occur remotely through the internet, in-person through forums such as localbitcoins.com, which offers both online and in-person opportunities to buy and sell bitcoins. There are currently no official
	designated market makers for bitcoins and hence no standard transaction sizes, bid-offer spreads or typical known cost per transaction. Marketplaces like localbitcoins.com are intended to create a market by bringing together counterparties trading
	in bitcoins but they do not provide any clearing or intermediary function.




	Anonymity




	Bitcoins have a reputation for providing privacy to its users, but the Bitcoin Network was not designed to ensure the anonymity of users. While
	the Blockchain records the unique addresses of individual bitcoin wallets, it does not contain anything about the people using them. However, an analysis of the public log of all bitcoin transactions suggests that it may be easy for a
	law enforcement agency to identify a number of bitcoin users. Off-Blockchain transactions occurring off the Bitcoin Network are not recorded and do not represent the transfer of bitcoins from one digital wallet address to another, though information
	regarding participants in an Off-Blockchain transaction may be recorded by the parties facilitating such Off-Blockchain transactions. Nevertheless, users determined to maintain anonymity may take certain precautions to enhance the likelihood that
	they and their transactions remain anonymous. For instance, a user may send its bitcoins to different addresses multiple times to make tracking the bitcoins through the Blockchain more difficult or, more simply, engage a so-called mixing
	service to switch its bitcoins with those of other users. However, some bitcoin exchanges may refuse to accept bitcoins from users who have used mixing services. To the extent that a significant portion of bitcoin users begin to value these mixing
	services and a substantial number of bitcoin exchanges refuse to accept these bitcoins, the demand for bitcoin may decrease and an investment in the Shares may be adversely affected.





	Competition



	Bitcoins are not the only
	type of digital currencies founded on cryptography, although as of the date of this prospectus it is considered the most prominent. Other cryptographic digital currencies have developed since the Bitcoin Networks inception: Ethereum, Ethereum
	Classic, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash and Monero are just a few examples of bitcoin alternatives. The Bitcoin Network, however, possesses the first-to-market advantage and has captured the majority of the industrys market share.



	Government Oversight



	As bitcoins
	have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Department of Justice, the
	Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the operations of bitcoins, bitcoin users and the Bitcoin Exchange, with particular focus on the extent to
	which bitcoins can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service-providers that hold bitcoins for users. Many of these state and federal
	agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by bitcoins to investors. In addition, Federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of bitcoin transactions or requirements for
	businesses engaged in bitcoin activity. On-going and future regulatory actions may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares or the ability of the Trust to continue to operate. Additionally, U.S. state
	and Federal, and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against bitcoin businesses or enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks, consumer harm, or


	 


	53







	Table of Contents



	criminal activity stemming from bitcoin activity. See Risk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an
	investment in the Shares or restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of the Bitcoin Network or the Bitcoin Exchange Market in a manner that adversely affects an investment in the Shares.


	Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Bitcoin Network, the Bitcoin
	Exchange Market, and their users, particularly bitcoin exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively
	impact the acceptance of bitcoin by users, merchants and service providers outside the United States and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the bitcoin economy in the European Union, China, Japan, Russia and the United States and
	globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of bitcoin.


	The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust or bitcoin is
	impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Shares.



	Not a Regulated Commodity Pool



	The Trust will not trade, buy, sell or hold bitcoin derivatives, including bitcoin futures contracts, on any futures exchange. The
	Trust is authorized solely to take immediate delivery of actual bitcoins. The Sponsor does not believe the Trusts activities are required to be regulated by the CFTC under the CEA as a commodity pool under current law, regulation
	and interpretation. The Trust will not be operated by a CFTC-regulated commodity pool operator because it will not trade, buy, sell or hold bitcoin derivatives, including bitcoin futures contracts, on any futures exchange. Investors in the Trust
	will not receive the regulatory protections afforded to investors in regulated commodity pools, nor may the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange or any futures exchange enforce its rules with respect to the Trusts activities. In
	addition, investors in the Trust will not benefit from the protections afforded to investors in bitcoin futures contracts on regulated futures exchanges.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by
	reference to, our audited and unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The following
	discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these
	differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors and Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.




	Trust Overview



	The Trust is a
	passive entity that is managed and administered by the Sponsor and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust holds bitcoins and, from time to time, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of bitcoins and, subject to
	exemptive relief from the SEC that we anticipate receiving prior to the offering contemplated hereby, will distribute bitcoins in connection with Redemption Baskets. As a passive investment vehicle, the investment objective of the Trust is for the
	Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index, less the Trusts liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin. The
	Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. As of March 31, 2017, the Trust had unlimited Shares authorized and 1,868,700 Shares issued and outstanding. On January 19, 2017, in connection with and prior to the

	Beginning on May 4, 2015, the date on which the first Shares traded on the OTCQX.

	The NAV is calculated using the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust considers its principal market, which since December 31, 2016 is GDAX. Prior to December 31,
	2016, the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust considered its principal market was Bitstamp.






	(3)


	The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings are derived from the Bitcoin Index Price as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings are calculated using a
	non-GAAP methodology where the volume-weighted average price is derived from multiple bitcoin exchanges. See Calculation of NAV, Bitcoin Index Price and Bitcoin Holdings. The Bitcoin Exchanges used to calculate the Bitcoin Index Price
	from the second quarter of 2015 to February 17, 2017 were Bitfinex, Bitstamp, itBit, OKCoin, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange) and Kraken (which was only included in the Index on the day of May 10, 2015). Effective February 17, 2017, the
	Index Provider removed OKCoin from the Index due to OKCoins implementation of a policy that currently suspends withdrawals from its exchange. From February 17, 2017 through the end of the first quarter of 2017, the Bitcoin Exchanges used to
	calculate the Bitcoin Index Price are Bitfinex, Bitstamp, itBit and GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange).





	Critical Accounting
	Policies and Estimates




	Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition



	The Trust considers its investment transactions to be the receipt of bitcoin for Share creations and the delivery of bitcoin for Share
	redemptions or payment of expenses. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Realized gains and losses are
	calculated using an average cost method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with the sale of bitcoins or the delivery of bitcoins for payment of the Sponsors Fee and other expenses and for Share redemptions.



	Valuation of Bitcoin



	Bitcoins are held
	by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust and are carried, for financial statement purposes, at fair value. Unlike the procedure used for determining the Bitcoin Index Price and the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings, which are calculated using a weighted
	average calculated across multiple Bitcoin Exchanges, the fair value of bitcoins and NAV presented in the financial statements are calculated in accordance with GAAP based on the price provided by the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust considers its
	principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time on the valuation date. Historically, the Trust considered Bitstamp to be its principal market with an exception for the period of January 5, 2015 through January 31, 2015 when the trust relied on
	pricing from Bitfinex. On January 5, 2015 Bitstamp suffered a disruption of operations, and in accordance with the Trusts procedures for determining its principal market, the Trust relied upon Bitfinex until January 31, 2015, when the


	 


	56







	Table of Contents



	Trust determined that it could again rely upon Bitstamp as the principal market. The Trust performed an annual assessment of the principal market at December 31, 2016, and identified a change in
	the principal market from Bitstamp to GDAX. The Trust has applied this change in principal market effective December 31, 2016 and has valued bitcoins held by the Trust since December 31, 2016 using the GDAX exchange. The cost basis of the investment
	in bitcoins recorded by the Trust for financial reporting purposes (but not for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the fair value of bitcoins at the time the bitcoins were deposited into the Trust. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ
	from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors.



	Investment Company Considerations



	The Trust is an investment company for GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
	those estimates.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	The Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.



	Cash Resources and Liquidity



	The
	Trust has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When removing bitcoins to pay expenses, the Sponsor endeavors to remove the exact number of bitcoins needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trusts holdings of assets other
	than bitcoin. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period.


	In exchange for the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary
	expense of the Trust during the periods covered by this prospectus was the Sponsors Fee. The Sponsors Fee is payable in bitcoins at such times as determined in the Sponsors sole discretion. The Trust is not aware of any trends,
	demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.



	Quantitative and Qualitative
	Disclosures about Market Risk



	The Trust Agreement does not authorize the Trustee to borrow for payment of the Trusts
	ordinary expenses. The Trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the Trust or holders of Shares to any foreign currency related market risk. The Trust does not invest in derivative financial instruments and has
	no foreign operations or long-term debt instruments.

	The principal market of the Trust as of March 31, 2017 was GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange). The principal market of the Trust as of March 31, 2016 was Bitstamp.






	(2)


	As of March 31, 2017, the NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by GDAX, the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust currently considers its principal market, as of
	4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. As of March 31, 2016, the NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by Bitstamp, the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust then considered its principal

	The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share is derived from the Bitcoin Index Price as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share is
	calculated using a non-GAAP methodology where the volume-weighted average price is derived from multiple bitcoin exchanges. See Calculation of NAV, Bitcoin Index Price and Bitcoin Holdings. The Bitcoin Exchanges used to calculate the
	Bitcoin Index Price as of March 31, 2017 were Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange) and itBit. The Bitcoin Exchanges used to calculate the Bitcoin Index Price as of March 31, 2016 were Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly
	known as Coinbase Exchange), itBit and OKCoin. Effective February 17, 2017, the Index Provider removed OKCoin from the Index due to OKCoins implementation of a policy that currently suspends withdrawals from its exchange.




	In the three months ended March 31, 2017, an additional 31,400 Shares (314 Baskets), were created in exchange for 2,939 bitcoins and 859
	bitcoins were deducted from the Trusts holdings and used by the Sponsor to settle expenses. No Shares were redeemed. In the three months ended March 31, 2016, an additional 51,100 Shares (511 Baskets), were created in exchange for 4,871
	bitcoins and 714 bitcoins were deducted from the Trusts holdings and used by the Sponsor to settle expenses. No Shares were redeemed. For accounting purposes, the Trust reflects creations and the bitcoin receivable with respect to such
	creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation, but does not issue Shares until the requisite number of bitcoins is received. In connection with Share redemptions, the Trust delivers bitcoins upon receipt of Shares.


	As of March 31, 2017, the Trust owned 174,175 bitcoins, with a market value of $184,012,124, based on the Bitcoin Index Price of $1,056.48 on
	March 31, 2017.

	The principal market of the Trust as of December 31, 2016 was GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange). The principal market of the Trust as of December 31, 2015 was Bitstamp.






	(2)


	As of December 31, 2016, the NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by GDAX, the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust currently considers its principal market, as of 4:00
	p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. As of December 31, 2015, the NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by Bitstamp, the Bitcoin Exchange that the Trust then considered its principal market,
	as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date.






	(3)


	The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share is derived from the Bitcoin Index Price as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time on the valuation date. The Trusts Bitcoin Holdings per Share is
	calculated using a non-GAAP methodology where the volume-weighted average price is derived from multiple bitcoin exchanges. See Calculation of NAV, Bitcoin Index Price and Bitcoin Holdings. The Bitcoin Exchanges used to calculate the
	Bitcoin Index Price as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), itBit and OKCoin.




	In the year ended December 31, 2016, an additional 360,800 Shares (3,608 Baskets), were created in exchange for 34,155 bitcoins and 3,161
	bitcoins were deducted from the Trusts holdings and used by the Sponsor to settle expenses. No Shares were redeemed. In the year ended December 31, 2015, 94,100 Shares (941 Baskets) were created in exchange for 9,040 bitcoins and 2,716
	bitcoins were deducted from the Trusts holdings and used by the Sponsor to settle expenses. No Shares were redeemed. For accounting purposes, the Trust reflects creations and the bitcoin receivable with respect to such creations on the date of
	receipt of a notification of a creation, but does not issue Shares until the requisite number of bitcoins is received.


	As of December 31,
	2016, the Trust owned 172,095 bitcoins, with a market value of approximately $164,214,460, based on the Bitcoin Index Price of $954.21 on December 31, 2016.



	Historical Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Prices



	As movements in the price of bitcoins will directly affect the price of the Shares, investors should understand recent movements in the price
	of bitcoin. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the bitcoin price are not indicators of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security
	breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world.

	The following table illustrates the movements in the Bitcoin Index Price from the beginning of the
	Trusts operations on September 25, 2013 to March 31, 2017. Since the beginning of the Trusts operations, the Bitcoin Index Price has ranged from $117.03 to $1,279.00, with the straight average being $496.93. The Sponsor has not observed
	a material difference between the Bitcoin Index Price and average prices from the constituent Bitcoin Exchanges individually or as a group.

	Prior to November 1, 2014, the Trust used the cascading set of rules described in Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and MarketBitcoin ValueThe Index and the Bitcoin Index Price starting with
	the second such rule. The Sponsor utilized the volume-weighted average bitcoin prices of the Major Bitcoin Exchanges published by bitcoincharts.com to satisfy either the second or third such rule when calculating the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings.
	In the event bitcoincharts.com was unavailable, the Sponsor utilized data taken from www.cryptocoincharts.info. During this period the Sponsor primarily used the volume-weighted average bitcoin prices published on either bitcoincharts.com or
	cryptocoincharts.info for Bitstamp, BTC-E, Mt. Gox and Bitfinex, as these were the exchanges with the highest trading volumes. However, not every exchange was included in each day during that period, as certain exchanges experienced interruptions. A
	number of smaller exchanges were also at times included in the calculation of the Bitcoin Index Price from the beginning of the Trust to November 1, 2014, including Camp BX, itBit, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Crypto-Trade, bitKonan, Ripple, Rock
	Trading Company, ANX and Asia Nexgen. On November 1, 2014, the Trust began using the Index to value its bitcoins for purposes of the creation and redemption of Baskets.

	SELLING SHAREHOLDERS



	The following table sets forth information regarding the selling shareholders beneficial ownership of the Trusts Shares as of
	        , 2017.


	Beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC and
	generally means that a


	person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she, or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power of that
	security. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all Shares shown that they beneficially own,
	subject to community property laws where applicable. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose.


	Our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 1,868,700 Shares outstanding as of March 31, 2017.


	The address of each selling shareholder and each person who may be deemed a beneficial owner of the shares held thereby is c/o
	            .

	ACTIVITIES OF THE TRUST



	The activities of the Trust will be limited to (1) issuing Baskets in exchange for bitcoins deposited by the Authorized Participants or
	Liquidity Providers, as applicable, with the Custodian as consideration, (2) transferring actual bitcoins as necessary to cover the Sponsors Fee and selling bitcoins as necessary to pay Additional Trust Expenses, (3) transferring
	actual bitcoins in exchange for Baskets surrendered for redemption by the Authorized Participants, (4) causing the Sponsor to sell bitcoins on the termination of the Trust and (5) engaging in all administrative and custodial procedures
	necessary to accomplish such activities in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. The Trust will not be actively managed. It will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by,
	changes in the market prices of bitcoins.



	Trust Objective



	The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index, less
	the Trusts liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin. A substantial direct investment in bitcoins may require expensive and sometimes complicated
	arrangements in connection with the acquisition, security and safekeeping of the bitcoins and may involve the payment of substantial fees to acquire such bitcoins from third-party facilitators through cash payments of U.S. Dollars. Although the
	Shares will not be the exact equivalent of a direct investment in bitcoins, they provide investors with an alternative that constitutes a relatively cost-effective way to participate in bitcoin markets through the securities market. Because the
	value of the Shares is tied to the value of the bitcoins held by the Trust, it is important to understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, bitcoins.



	Strategy Behind the Shares



	The Shares
	are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in bitcoin markets through an investment in securities. On the first day the Shares were offered, each Share in the initial Basket represented 0.100 bitcoin. The logistics of accepting,
	transferring and safekeeping of bitcoins are dealt with by the Sponsor, Administrator and Custodian, and the related expenses are built into the price of the Shares. Therefore, Shareholders do not have additional tasks or costs in addition to those
	associated with investing in any other publicly traded security.


	The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors
	with a simple and cost-effective means, with minimal credit risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of directly holding bitcoins. The Shares offer an investment that is:


	 




	 


	


	 



	Easily Accessible and Relatively Cost Efficient

	. Investors in the Shares can also directly access bitcoin markets through the Bitcoin Exchange Market. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more
	effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use bitcoins by using the Shares instead of directly purchasing and holding bitcoins, and for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than
	those associated with the direct purchase, storage and safekeeping of bitcoins.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Exchange Traded and Transparent

	. The Shares will be listed and trade on NYSE Arca, providing investors with an efficient means to implement various investment strategies. Upon effectiveness of the registration
	statement of which this prospectus is a part, the Shares will be eligible for margin accounts and will be backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trust will not hold or employ any derivative securities. Furthermore, the value of the Trusts
	assets will be reported each day on https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-investment-trust/#market-performance.




	 




	 


	


	 




	Minimal Credit Risk

	. The Shares represent an interest in actual bitcoins owned by the Trust. The
	Trusts bitcoins in the Custodians possession are not subject to borrowing arrangements with third





	 


	63







	Table of Contents





	 



	parties or counterparty or credit risks. This contrasts with the other financial products such as TeraExchange swaps through which investors gain exposure to bitcoins through the use of
	derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks.





	 




	 


	


	 



	Safekeeping System

	. The Custodian has been appointed to store and safekeep the bitcoins for the Trust using a segregated and therefore diversified safekeeping storage system. The hardware, software,
	administration and continued technological development that are used by the Custodian may not be available or cost-effective for many investors.




	The Trust differentiates itself from competing digital currency financial vehicles, to the extent that such digital currency financial
	vehicles may develop, in the following ways:


	 




	 


	


	 



	Custodian

	. The Custodian that holds the private keys for the digital wallets of the Trust is Xapo Inc. Other digital currency financial vehicles that use cold storage may not use a custodian to hold their private
	keys.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Cold Storage of Private Keys

	. All of the private keys for the Trusts Vault Account are kept in cold storage, which means that the bitcoins held by the Trusts Vault Account are not directly
	connected to, or accessible from, the internet or other computers without the private keys. See Custody of the Trusts Bitcoins for more information relating to the distribution and withdrawal of the Trusts private keys to and
	from cold storage. Other digital currency financial vehicles may not utilize cold storage or may utilize less effective cold storage-related hardware and security protocols.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Location of Private Vaults

	. Vaults are located in geographically dispersed locations across the world, including but not limited to the United States, Europe, including Switzerland, and South America.
	Confidential information such as the private keys and cryptographic materials are physically stored on offline servers that never have and never will have access to the internet or any other kind of network. Vault locations are protected by
	extraordinary security measures, including intense human, biometric and automated systems, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Vaults incorporate multiple layers of extremely advanced forms of cryptographic security to secure bitcoins. These
	processes include multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation. The geographic dispersion of vaults is designed to protect assets from being lost due to the compromise of any given vault location. Even if the physical and cryptographic
	layers of security in one jurisdiction are overcome, the other vault locations would remain uncompromised.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Enhanced Security

	. The Custodian and Sponsor have put enhanced security procedures in place that require one or more employees of the Sponsor to verify each transaction, with each employee having a unique
	verification method. The Custodian and the Sponsor have put additional similar enhanced security procedures in place to protect against the malicious movement of bitcoin.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Custodian Audits

	. The Custodian has agreed to allow the Trust and the Sponsor take any necessary steps to verify that satisfactory internal control system and procedures are in place, and to visit and inspect the
	systems on which the Custodian Coins are held. The Custodian is also obligated to provide the Trust and Sponsor with both independent and audit reports on the Bitcoin Account.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Directly Held Bitcoins

	. The Trust directly owns actual bitcoins held through the Custodian. The direct ownership of bitcoins is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. This may differ from other digital
	currency financial vehicles that provide bitcoin exposure through other means, such as the use of financial or derivative instruments.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Structure

	. The Shares intend to track the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index, less the Trusts liabilities and expenses. The Trust seeks to achieve this objective by directly
	owning bitcoins. This structure may be different from other digital currency financial vehicles that seek to track the performance of the price of bitcoins or other digital currencies through the use of futures contracts or derivative instruments.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Sponsors Fee

	. The relatively low level of the Sponsors Fee that is paid to the Sponsor is a competitive factor that may influence an investors decision to purchase Shares.

	Secondary Market Trading



	While the Trusts investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index,
	less the Trusts liabilities and expenses, the Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher than the Bitcoin Holdings per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the Bitcoin
	Holdings per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours and liquidity between the secondary market and larger Bitcoin Exchanges in the Bitcoin Exchange Market. While the Shares will be listed and trade on NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. until
	4:00 p.m., New York time, liquidity in the Bitcoin Exchange Market may fluctuate depending upon the volume and availability of larger Bitcoin Exchanges. As a result, during periods in which Bitcoin Exchange Market liquidity is limited or a
	major Bitcoin Exchange is off-line, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen.



	Trust Expenses



	The Trusts only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsors Fee. The Sponsors Fee will be determined by
	applying a 2% annual rate to the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings, as calculated and published by the Sponsor or its delegates, and converting the resulting U.S. Dollar amount into bitcoins at the Bitcoin Index Price, on a daily basis. The rate of the
	Sponsors Fee is subject to the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Payments of the Sponsors Fee will occur monthly in arrears. To pay the Sponsors Fee, the Custodian will, when directed by the Sponsor, (i) withdraw from the
	Bitcoin Account the number of bitcoins equal to the accrued but unpaid Sponsors Fee, determined as described above and (ii) transfer such bitcoins to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor.


	The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsors Fee in its discretion for stated periods of time.
	Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of the Sponsors Fee. As consideration for its receipt of the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor has assumed the obligation to pay the Sponsor-paid Expenses.


	The Sponsor has not assumed the obligation to pay Additional Trust Expenses. If Additional Trust Expenses are incurred, the Sponsor will cause
	the Custodian to convert bitcoins into U.S. Dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. The number of bitcoins represented by a Share will
	decline each time the Trust pays the Sponsors Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses. See Expenses.



	Impact of Trust Expenses on the
	Trusts Bitcoin Holdings



	The Trust will pay the Sponsors Fee to the Sponsor in bitcoins. In addition, the Trust will sell
	bitcoins to raise the funds needed for the payment of any Additional Trust Expenses. The purchase price received as consideration for such sales will be the Trusts sole source of funds to cover its Additional Trust Expenses. The Trust will not
	engage in any activity designed to derive a profit from changes in the prices of bitcoins. Because the number of bitcoins held by the Trust will decrease when bitcoins are used to pay the Sponsors Fee or sold to permit the payment of
	Additional Trust Expenses, the number of bitcoins represented by each Share will decrease over the life of the Trust. Accordingly, the Shareholders will bear the cost of the Sponsors Fee and Additional Trust Expenses. New deposits of bitcoins
	into the Bitcoin Account that are received in exchange for additional new Baskets issued by the Trust will not reverse this trend.

	Table of Contents




	Hypothetical Expense Example



	The following table illustrates the anticipated impact of the payment of the Trusts expenses on the fractional number of bitcoins
	represented by each outstanding Share for three years. It assumes that the only transfers of bitcoins will be those needed to pay the Sponsors Fee and that the price of bitcoins and the number of Shares remain constant during the three-year
	period covered. The table does not show the impact of any Additional Trust Expenses. Any Additional Trust Expenses, if and when incurred, will accelerate the decrease in the fractional number of bitcoins represented by each Share. In addition, the
	table does not show the effect of any waivers of the Sponsors Fee that may be in effect from time to time.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST



	The Trust is a Delaware Statutory Trust that was formed on September 13, 2013 by the filing of the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware
	Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (DSTA). The Trust operates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.


	The Trust holds only bitcoins and is expected from time to time to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of bitcoins and to distribute
	bitcoins in connection with redemptions of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of bitcoins as represented by the Index, less the Trusts liabilities and expenses. The Sponsor
	believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective and convenient investment relative to a direct, outright investment in bitcoins.


	The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in, and ownership of, the Trust. The Trust is passive and is not
	managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The bitcoins held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust will be transferred out of the Bitcoin Account only in the following circumstances: transferred to pay the Sponsors Fee,
	distributed to Authorized Participants or Liquidity Providers, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of Baskets, transferred to be sold on an as-needed basis to pay Additional Trust Expenses, sold on behalf of the Trust in the event the
	Trust terminates and liquidates its assets or as otherwise required by law or regulation. Assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery or sale of bitcoins to pay the Sponsors Fee or
	any Additional Trust Expenses will be a taxable event for Shareholders. See U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesTax Consequences to U.S. Holders.


	The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not required
	to register under the Investment Company Act. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts or other derivative contracts regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC. The Sponsor believes that the Trust is not a commodity
	pool for purposes of the CEA, and that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with the operation of the Trust.


	The Trust expects to create and redeem Shares from time to time but only in Baskets. A Basket equals a block of 100 Shares. The number of
	outstanding Shares is expected to increase and decrease from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption of Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets require the delivery to the Trust, or the distribution by the Trust, of the
	number of bitcoins represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed. The creation and redemption of a Basket will be made only in exchange for the delivery to the Trust, or the distribution by the Trust, of the number of whole and fractional
	bitcoins represented by each Basket being created or redeemed, the number of which is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation or redemption order, as adjusted for
	the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time (the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one bitcoin), and
	multiplying such quotient by 100. Each Share currently represents approximately 0.093 of a bitcoin. Each Share in the initial Baskets represented approximately 0.100 bitcoin. The number of bitcoins required to create a Basket, or to be delivered
	upon a redemption of a Basket, will gradually decrease over time due to the transfer or sale of the Trusts bitcoins to pay the Sponsors Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses. The Trust will not accept or distribute cash in exchange for
	Baskets, other than upon its dissolution. See Plan of Distribution.


	The Administrator will determine the Trusts
	Bitcoin Holdings (which is the aggregate U.S. Dollar value, based on the Bitcoin Index Price, of the Trusts bitcoins less its liabilities) on each day the Shares trade on NYSE Arca as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as
	practicable. The Administrator will also determine the Bitcoin Holdings per Share, which equals the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings divided by the number of outstanding Shares. Each Business Day, the Sponsor will publish the Trusts Bitcoin
	Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share on the Trusts website, https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-investment-trust/#market-performance, as soon as


	 


	67







	Table of Contents



	practicable after the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share have been determined by the Administrator. See Valuation of Bitcoins and Definition of the Trusts
	Bitcoin Holdings.


	The Trusts assets will consist solely of bitcoins. Each Share will represent a proportional interest, based
	on the total number of Shares outstanding, in the bitcoins held by the Trust, less the Trusts liabilities (which include accrued but unpaid fees and expenses). The Sponsor expects that the market trading price of the Shares will fluctuate over
	time in response to the market prices of bitcoins. In addition, the Sponsor expects that the trading price of the Shares will reflect the estimated accrued but unpaid expenses of the Trust.


	Investors may obtain on a 24-hour basis bitcoin pricing information from various financial information service providers or Bitcoin Network
	information sites such as Tradeblock.com or bitcoincharts.com. Current Bitcoin Index Prices are also generally available with bid/ask spreads directly from Bitcoin Exchanges. As of the date of this prospectus, the constituent Bitcoin Exchanges of
	the Index were Bitstamp, GDAX (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange), Kraken and itBit. Market prices for the Shares will be available from a variety of sources, including brokerage firms, information websites and other information service providers.
	In addition, on each business day the Trusts website will provide pricing information for the Shares.


	The Trust has no fixed
	termination date.

	THE SPONSOR



	The Trusts Sponsor is Grayscale Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 29, 2013 and a wholly owned
	subsidiary by Digital Currency Group, Inc. The Sponsors principal place of business is 636 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10011 and its telephone number is (212) 668-5920. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and
	the governing documents of the Sponsor, Digital Currency Group, Inc., the sole member of the Sponsor, is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor.



	The Sponsors Role



	The Sponsor
	arranged for the creation of the Trust and will arrange for the registration of the Shares for their public offering in the United States and their listing on NYSE Arca. As consideration for its receipt of the Sponsors Fee from the Trust, the
	Sponsor is obligated to pay the Sponsor-paid Expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trusts organization and will pay for the costs of the initial sale of the Shares.


	The Sponsor is generally responsible for the administration of the Trust under the provisions of the Trust Agreement. This includes (i)
	selecting and monitoring the Trusts Service Providers and from time to time engaging additional, successor or replacement Service Providers and (ii) upon dissolution of the Trust, distributing the Trusts remaining bitcoins or the
	cash proceeds of the sale of the Trusts remaining bitcoins to the owners of record of the Shares.


	The Sponsor may transfer all or
	substantially all of its assets to an entity that carries on the business of the Sponsor if at the time of the transfer the successor assumes all of the obligations of the Sponsor under the Trust Agreement. In such an event, the Sponsor will be
	relieved of all further liability under the Trust Agreement.


	The Sponsors Fee is paid by the Trust to the Sponsor as compensation
	for services performed under the Trust Agreement and for the Sponsors agreement to pay the Sponsor-paid Expenses. See Activities of the TrustTrust Expenses.



	Marketing Agent Agreement



	The Sponsor
	has entered into a Marketing Agent Agreement with an independent third party to assist the Sponsor in distributing the Shares, developing an ongoing marketing plan for the Trust, preparing marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the
	content on the Trusts website, www.grayscale.co, executing the marketing plan for the Trust and providing strategic and tactical research on the global bitcoin market. For more information about the distribution of the Shares, see Plan
	of Distribution.



	Index License Agreement



	The Index Provider and the Sponsor have entered into an index license agreement (the Index License Agreement) governing the
	Sponsors use of the Index for calculation of the Bitcoin Index Price. The Index Provider may adjust the calculation methodology for the Index without notice to, or consent of, the Trust or its Shareholders. Under the Index License Agreement,
	the Sponsor pays a monthly fee and a fee based on the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings to the Index Provider in consideration of its license to the Sponsor of Index-related intellectual property.






	Management of the Sponsor



	Under the
	Trust Agreement, all management functions of the Trust have been delegated to and are conducted by the Sponsor, its agents and its affiliates, including without limitation, the Custodian and its agents. As officers of the Sponsor, Barry E. Silbert,
	the principal executive officer of the Sponsor, and Simcha Wurtzel, the principal financial officer of the Sponsor, may take certain actions and execute certain agreements and certifications for the Trust, in their capacity as the principal officers
	of the Sponsor.

	The Trustees fees and expenses under the Trust Agreement will be paid by the Sponsor.








	THE TRANSFER AGENT



	The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York corporation, will serve as the Transfer Agent of the Trust under the Trust Agreement and pursuant to
	the terms and provisions of the Transfer Agency and Service Agreement. The Transfer Agent has its principal office at One Wall Street, New York, New York 10286.



	The Transfer Agents Role



	The
	Transfer Agent holds the Shares in book-entry form. The Administrator directs the Transfer Agent to credit or debit the number of Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets to the applicable Authorized Participant. The Transfer Agent will issue or
	cancel each Authorized Participants Creation Basket or Redemption Basket, as applicable. The Transfer Agent will also assist with the preparation of Shareholders account and tax statements.


	The Sponsor will indemnify and hold harmless the Transfer Agent, and the Transfer Agent will incur no liability for the refusal, in good

	The Administrators Role



	Pursuant
	to the Trust Administration and Accounting Agreement, the Administrator is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust. The responsibilities of the Administrator include (i) preparing and providing periodic reports on behalf
	of the Trust to investors, (ii) processing orders to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian, the Transfer Agent and DTC, (iii) publishing the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin

	Expenses.

	law, act, regulation or interpretation of the same even though the same may thereafter have been altered, changed, amended or repealed, (ii) the Trusts offering materials or documents (excluding information provided by the Administrator),
	(iii) any instructions or (iv) any opinion of legal counsel for the Trust or the Administrator, or arising out of transactions or other activities of the Trust which occurred prior to the commencement of the Trust Administration and Accounting
	Agreement.


	 


	71







	Table of Contents



	The Administrator will also agree to facilitate the Conversion Procedures on behalf of Authorized
	Participants, whereby the Authorized Participants can purchase or sell bitcoins through a Liquidity Provider. See Description of Creation and Redemption of Shares for further discussion of the Administrators role in the Conversion
	Procedures.





	AUTHORIZED PARTICIPANTS



	An Authorized Participant must enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trust to govern its placement of orders
	to create and redeem Baskets. The Participant Agreement sets forth the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of bitcoins required for creations and redemptions. The Participant Agreement also provides the Sponsor
	and the Administrator with the authority to terminate the relationship with an Authorized Participant if the Sponsor or Administrator determines that an Authorized Participant does not to comply with the regulatory and registration requirements
	promulgated by FinCEN or other state authorities.


	Each Authorized Participant must (i) be a registered broker-dealer,
	(ii) enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor, the Administrator, the Marketing Agent and Liquidity Providers and (iii) in the case of the creation or redemption of Baskets that do not use the Conversion Procedures, own an
	Authorized Participant Self-Administered Account.


	A list of the current Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Sponsor. The
	Trust has engaged Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, KCG Americas LLC and Wedbush Securities as Authorized Participants. Additional Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the discretion of the Sponsor.





	LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS



	In addition to setting forth the procedures for the delivery of bitcoins required for creations and redemptions, the Participant Agreement
	also sets forth the procedures for the delivery of bitcoins required for creations and redemptions in cash, as facilitated by the Liquidity Provider.


	Each Liquidity Provider must (i) enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor, the Trust, the Marketing Agent and the Authorized
	Participant and (ii) own a bitcoin wallet address that is recognized by the Custodian as belonging to a Liquidity Provider (a Liquidity Provider Account). A list of the current Liquidity Providers can be obtained from the Sponsor. As of
	the date of this prospectus, Genesis is the only acting Liquidity Provider. The Sponsor intends to engage additional Liquidity Providers who are unaffiliated with the Trust in the future.





	THE CUSTODIAN



	Xapo Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xapo Holdings Limited, is authorized to serve as the Trusts custodian
	under the Trust Agreement and pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Custodian Agreement. The Custodian has its principal office at 2983 Woodside Road, Woodside, California 94062.



	The Custodians Role



	Under the
	Custodian Agreement, the Custodian is responsible for keeping the private key or keys that provide access to the Trusts digital wallets and vaults secure. Pursuant to a request from the Sponsor or the Trust, the Custodian shall establish and
	maintain an account with one or more wallets (the Wallet Account) and one or more cold-storage vault accounts (the Vault Account and, together with the Wallet Account and any subaccounts associated therewith, the
	Bitcoin Account) in the name of the Sponsor and the Trust. The Custodian deposits and withdraws bitcoins to and from the Bitcoin Account at the instruction of the Sponsor. The Custodian is responsible for administering the Bitcoin
	Account.


	 


	72







	Table of Contents



	The Custodian will withdraw from the Bitcoin Account the number of bitcoins necessary to pay the
	Trust expenses provided for in the Trust Agreement. In the event that the Sponsors Fee and the Additional Trust Expenses, if any, exceed the bitcoin balance of the Wallet Account, the Custodian will withdraw additional bitcoins from the Vault
	Account to pay the excess.


	The Custodian will be paid a fee by the Sponsor.


	Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian must indemnify the Trust and Sponsor for damages arising out of or caused by the Custodian or by
	the Sponsors and the Trusts reasonable reliance on the Custodians untrue representations and warranties. The Custodian must also indemnify the Sponsor and Trust from any loss or damage caused by any employee, agent, representative
	or independent contractor engaged by the Custodian, whether or not such act or omission occurred within the scope of his employment or engagement.


	The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time purchase or sell bitcoins for their own accounts and as agent for their customers or
	Shares for their own accounts.


	No more than once per calendar year, the Sponsor or the Trust may request that the Custodian deliver an
	officers certificate to certify that (i) the Custodian has complied, and is in compliance currently, with the Custodian Agreement during the preceding year and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Custodian in the Custodian
	Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date of such certificate, and have been true and correct throughout the preceding year.


	If the Custodian resigns in its capacity as custodian, the Sponsor may appoint an additional or replacement custodian and enter into a custody
	agreement on behalf of the Trust with such custodian. Furthermore, the Sponsor and the Trust may use Bitcoin custody services or similar services provided by entities other than Xapo, Inc. at any time without prior notice to Xapo, Inc.

	CONFLICTS OF INTEREST




	General



	The Sponsor has not established
	formal procedures to resolve all potential conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors may be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the Sponsor attempts to monitor
	these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Sponsor to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the Trust.


	Prospective investors should be aware that the Sponsor presently intends to assert that Shareholders have, by subscribing for Shares of the
	Trust, consented to the following conflicts of interest in the event of any proceeding alleging that such conflicts violated any duty owed by the Sponsor to investors.



	Digital Currency Group, Inc.



	Digital
	Currency Group, Inc., the sole member and parent company of the Sponsor, is also the sole shareholder and parent company of Genesis, which is currently the only acting Liquidity Provider. Digital Currency Group, Inc. also owns less than 3% of the
	Index Providers voting equity either directly or through warrants and a minority interest in the Custodian that represents less than 1.0% of the Custodians equity. Digital Currency Group, Inc. owns a minority interest holder in Coinbase,
	which operates the GDAX, representing approximately 0.5% of its equity, and a minority interest holder in Paxos, which operates itBit, representing less than 0.3% of its equity.



	The Sponsor



	The Sponsor has a conflict
	of interest in allocating its own limited resources among, when applicable, different clients and potential future business ventures, to each of which it owes fiduciary duties. Additionally, the professional staff of the Sponsor also services other
	affiliates of the Sponsor and their respective clients. Although the Sponsor and its professional staff cannot and will not devote all of its or their respective time or resources to the management of the business and affairs of the Trust, the
	Sponsor intends to devote, and to cause its professional staff to devote, sufficient time and resources to manage properly the business and affairs of the Trust consistent with its or their respective fiduciary duties to the Trust and others.


	Because of the Sponsors affiliated status, it may be disincentivized to replace affiliated service providers. In connection with these
	conflicts of interest, Shareholders should understand that affiliated service providers receive fees for providing services to the Trust and clients of the affiliated service providers may pay commissions at negotiated rates which are greater or
	less than the rate paid by the Trust.


	The Sponsor and the affiliated service providers may, from time-to-time, have conflicting demands
	in respect of their obligations to the Trust and, in the future, to other clients. It is possible that future business ventures of the Sponsor and the affiliated service providers may generate larger fees, resulting in increased payments to
	employees, and therefore, incentivizing the Sponsor and/or the affiliated service providers to allocate it/their limited resources accordingly to the potential detriment of the Trust.


	There is an absence of arms length negotiation with respect to some of the terms of this offering, and, where applicable, there has been
	no independent due diligence conducted with respect to this offering. The Sponsor will, however, not retain any affiliated servicer provider for the Trust which the Sponsor has reason to believe would knowingly or deliberately favor any other client
	over the Trust.



	The Liquidity Providers



	As of the date of this prospectus, Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust, is the only acting Liquidity Provider. When the Administrator acts on
	behalf of an Authorized Participant to facilitate the Conversion Procedures with the Liquidity Provider, it will serve as an independent third party between Genesis, on the one hand, and the


	 


	74







	Table of Contents



	Custodian, the Sponsor, the Trust and the Shareholders, on the other. However, in its capacity as a Liquidity Provider, Genesis may be incentivized to act in favor of the Sponsor, the Trust and
	the Shareholders when conducting the Conversion Procedures.


	In addition, Genesis may engage in bitcoin trading with the Trusts
	affiliated entities. For example, when the Sponsor receives the Sponsors Fee in bitcoins, it sells the bitcoins through Genesis. For this service, Genesis charges the Sponsor a 1% transaction fee, which is not borne by the Trust. Additionally,
	both the Sponsors parent company, Digital Currency Group, and the Custodian, Xapo, Inc., are customers of Genesis and may buy or sell bitcoin through Genesis from time to time, independent of the Trust.


	Authorized Participants may buy and sell bitcoins through Liquidity Providers other than in connection with orders placed with the Trust. If
	an Authorized Participant provides a more lucrative fee to a Liquidity Provider for services rendered independent of the Trust, the Liquidity Provider may be incentivized to refuse to act as a Liquidity Provider, which could decrease the liquidity
	of the Trust. Lastly, several employees of the Sponsor and the Sponsors parent company, Digital Currency Group, Inc., are FINRA-registered representatives who maintain their licenses through Genesis.



	Proprietary Trading/Other Clients



	Because the officers of the Sponsor may trade bitcoins for their own personal trading accounts (subject to certain internal trading policies
	and procedures) at the same time that they are managing the account of the Trust, prospective investors should be aware that the activities of the officers of the Sponsor, subject to their fiduciary duties, may, from time-to-time, result in taking
	positions in their personal trading accounts which are opposite of the positions taken for the Trust. Records of the Sponsors officers personal trading accounts will not be available for inspection by Shareholders.



	Relationships of the Index Provider with Genesis, the Sponsor and Management of the Sponsor



	The Sponsor and its affiliates rely on services provided by the Index Provider (in addition to the calculation of the Index), and may otherwise
	be interested in the success of the Index Provider. These relationships include:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Barry E. Silbert, the Chief Executive Officer of the Sponsor, acts as an advisor to the Index Provider and owns less than 1.0% of the Index Providers voting equity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Digital Currency Group, Inc., the sole member and parent company of the Sponsor owns less than 3% of the Index Providers voting equity either directly or through warrants; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Genesis licenses and uses a trading software platform provided by the Index Provider to operate its bitcoin trading desk and facilitate Genesiss actions as a Liquidity Provider. Although the Index Provider does
	not currently utilize data from over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms, per the terms of the license, the Index Provider is entitled to use the over-the-counter trading data from Genesis in the Index.




	Under the rules governing the calculation of the Bitcoin Index Price, if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Index does not reflect
	an accurate bitcoin price, then the Administrator will employ an alternative method to determine the Bitcoin Index Price. Because such a determination could reflect negatively upon the Index Provider, lead to a decrease in the Index Providers
	revenue or otherwise adversely affect the Index Provider, and because of the relationships listed above, the Sponsor has a conflict of interest with respect to the Index Provider.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE SHARES




	General



	The Trust is authorized under
	the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. Shares will be issued only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 100 Shares) and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The Shares represent units of fractional
	undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part will require the registration of such
	additional Shares.



	Description of Limited Rights



	The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and should not be viewed as similar to shares of a corporation operating a
	business enterprise with management and a board of directors. A Shareholder will not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and
	entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. For example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends. The Shares do not entitle their holders
	to any conversion or pre-emptive rights or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions.



	Voting and Approvals



	Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have limited voting rights. For example, the Sponsor will terminate the Trust upon the agreement of
	Shareholders owning at least 75% of the outstanding Shares. In addition, any amendment that adversely affects the rights of Shareholders, appoints a new Sponsor, dissolves the Trust or makes any material change to the Trusts basic investment
	policies or structure must be approved by the affirmative vote of Shareholders owning at least 50% of the outstanding Shares.



	Distributions



	If the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Sponsor will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts of the cash proceeds of the liquidation
	remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Sponsor shall determine. See
	Description of the Trust DocumentsDescription of the Trust AgreementThe TrusteeTermination of the Trust. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Transfer Agent for a distribution will be entitled to
	receive their pro rata portion of any distribution.



	Redemption of the Shares



	Effective October 28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which Shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of
	their Shares through Genesis, the sole Authorized Participant at that time, out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. On July 11, 2016, Genesis and the Trust entered into a settlement
	agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus
	prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. The Trust is seeking an exemption from the SEC under Regulation M in order to reinstate its redemption program, but cannot at this time predict whether it will be successful in
	obtaining such regulatory relief.


	If and when such regulatory relief is obtained, the Shares may be redeemed only by or through an
	Authorized Participant and only in whole Baskets. See Risk FactorsRisk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the SharesThe Trust and an affiliate of the Trust recently entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC
	concerning the operation of the Trusts former redemption program and Description of Creation and Redemption of Shares.

	Table of Contents




	Book-Entry Form



	Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates have been deposited by the Transfer Agent
	with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates will evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) DTC Participants such as
	banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies
	and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are transferable only through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by
	instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry
	practice.



	Share Splits



	If the
	Sponsor believes that the per Share price in the public market for Shares has risen or fallen outside a desirable trading price range, the Sponsor may direct the Transfer Agent to declare a split or reverse split in the number of Shares outstanding
	and to make a corresponding change in the number of Shares constituting a Basket.

	CUSTODY OF THE TRUSTS BITCOINS



	All bitcoins exist and are stored on the Blockchain, the decentralized transaction ledger of the Bitcoin Network. The Blockchain records most
	transactions (including mining of new bitcoins) for all bitcoins in existence, and in doing so verifies the location of each bitcoin (or fraction thereof) in a particular digital wallet. The Bitcoin Account is maintained by the Custodian and cold
	storage mechanisms are used for the Vault Account by the Custodian. Each digital wallet of the Trust may be accessed using its corresponding private key. The Custodians custodial operations maintain custody of the private keys that have been
	deposited in cold storage at its various vaulting premises which are located in geographically dispersed locations across the world, including but not limited to the United States, Europe, including Switzerland, and South America. The locations of
	the vaulting premises change may regularly and are kept confidential by the Custodian for security purposes.


	The term cold
	storage refers to a safeguarding method by which the private keys corresponding to bitcoins stored on a digital wallet are removed from any computers actively connected to the internet. Cold storage of private keys may involve keeping such
	wallet on a non-networked computer or electronic device or storing the public key and private keys relating to the digital wallet on a storage device (for example, a USB thumb drive) or printed medium (for example, papyrus or paper) and deleting the
	digital wallet from all computers. A digital wallet may receive deposits of bitcoins but may not send bitcoins without use of the bitcoins corresponding private keys. In order to send bitcoin from a digital wallet in which the private keys are
	kept in cold storage, either the private keys must be retrieved from cold storage and entered them into a bitcoin software program to sign the transaction, or the unsigned transaction must be sent to the cold server in which the private
	keys are held for signature by the private keys. At that point, the user of the digital wallet can transfer its bitcoins.


	The Custodian
	is the custodian of the Trusts private keys in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Custodian Agreement and will utilize the certain security procedures such as algorithms, codes, passwords, encryption or telephone call-backs
	(together, the Security Procedures) in the administration and operation of the Trust and the safekeeping of its bitcoins and private keys. The Custodian has created a Vault Account for the Trust assets in which private keys are placed in
	cold storage. The Custodian segregates the private keys stored with it from any other assets it holds or holds for others.


	Multiple
	distinct private keys must sign any transaction in order to transfer the Trusts bitcoins from a multi-signature address to any other address on the Bitcoin blockchain. Distinct private keys required for multi-signature address transfers reside
	in geographically dispersed vault locations. The Custodian refers to these vault locations, where transactions are signed by private keys, as signing vaults. In addition to multiple signing vaults, the Custodian maintains multiple
	back-up vaults in which backup private keys are stored. In the event that one or more of the signing vaults were to be compromised, back-up vaults can be activated and used as signing vaults to complete a transaction within
	72 hours.


	As such, if any one signing vault were to be compromised, it would have no impact on the ability of the Trust to access its
	bitcoins, other than a possible delay in operations of 72 hours, while one or more of the backup vaults was transitioned to a signing vault. These security procedures ensure that there is no single point of failure in the protection of
	the Trusts assets.


	The Custodian is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of bitcoins from Authorized Participant
	Self-Administered Accounts or Liquidity Provider Accounts, as applicable, held with the Custodian and transfer such bitcoins into the Bitcoin Account. Deposits of bitcoins will be immediately available to the Trust to the extent such bitcoins have
	not already been transferred to the Vault Account. Generally, bitcoins transferred to the Bitcoin Account will be directly deposited into digital wallets for which the keys are already in cold storage.


	The process of accessing and withdrawing bitcoins from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket will follow the same general procedure as
	depositing bitcoins with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. See Description of Creation and Redemption of Shares.


	If bitcoins need to be withdrawn from the Trust in connection with a redemption, the Custodian will ensure that the private keys to those
	bitcoins sign the withdrawal transaction.

	DESCRIPTION OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES



	The following is a description of the material terms of the Trust Documents as they relate to the creation and redemption of the Trusts
	Shares.


	The Trust issues Shares on an ongoing basis, but only in one or more Baskets (with a Basket being a block of 100 Shares). Subject
	to obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC to reinstate its redemption program, the Trust intends to redeem Shares in Baskets on an ongoing basis from Authorized Participants, according to the procedures described herein.


	The creation and redemption of a Basket require the delivery to the Trust, or the distribution by the Trust, of the number of whole and
	fractional bitcoins represented by each Basket being created or redeemed, the number of which is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation or redemption order, as
	adjusted for the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time (the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one
	bitcoin), and multiplying such quotient by 100 (the Basket Bitcoin Amount). The Basket Bitcoin Amount multiplied by the number of Baskets being created or redeemed is the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount.


	The Basket Bitcoin Amount will gradually decrease over time as the Trusts bitcoins are used to pay the Trusts expenses. Each Share
	currently represents approximately 0.093 of a bitcoin.


	Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and
	redeem Baskets. Each Authorized Participant must (i) be a registered broker-dealer, (ii) enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor, the Administrator, the Marketing Agent and the Liquidity Providers and (iii) in the case of
	the creation or redemption of Baskets that do not use the Conversion Procedures, own a bitcoin wallet address that is recognized by the Custodian as belonging to the Authorized Participant (an Authorized Participant Self-Administered
	Account). Authorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Baskets. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants will
	only be able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant.


	Although the Trust will create Baskets only upon the receipt of
	bitcoins, and will redeem Baskets only by distributing bitcoins, an Authorized Participant may deposit cash with the Administrator, which will facilitate the purchase or sale of bitcoins through a Liquidity Provider on behalf of an Authorized
	Participant (the Conversion Procedures). Liquidity Providers must (i) enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor, the Administrator, the Marketing Agent and each Authorized Participant and (ii) own a Liquidity Provider Account.


	The Conversion Procedures will be facilitated by a single Liquidity Provider. On an order-by-order basis, the Sponsor will select the
	Liquidity Provider that it believes will provide the best execution of the Conversion Procedures, and will base its decision on factors such as the Liquidity Providers creditworthiness, financial stability, the timing and speed of execution,
	liquidity and the likelihood of, and capabilities in, execution, clearance and settlement. In the event that an order cannot be filled in its entirety by a single Liquidity Provider, additional Liquidity Provider(s) will be selected by the Sponsor
	to fill the remaining amount based on the criteria above.


	The trade date on which the Basket Bitcoin Amount is determined is
	different for in-kind and in-cash orders. For in-kind orders, the trade date is the day on which an order is placed, whereas the trade date for in-cash orders is the day after which an order is placed. This could result in a different execution
	price for in-kind and in-cash orders.


	For example, if an Authorized Participant submits an in-kind order at 2:00 p.m. on a Monday, the
	Basket Bitcoin Amount required to purchase a Basket of Shares will be determined at 4:00 p.m., or as soon as


	 


	79







	Table of Contents



	practicable thereafter, on that same day. Alternatively, for in-cash orders, if an Authorized Participant submits an order at 2:00 p.m. on a Monday and pays the requisite Cash Collateral Amount
	at 3:00 p.m. on that same date, the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount will nevertheless be determined at 4:00 p.m., or as soon as practicable thereafter, on Tuesday. Pursuant to the Conversion Procedures, the Authorized Participant is obligated to pay the
	Cash Exchange Rate which is calculated on Monday, times the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, which is calculated on Tuesday. The Liquidity Provider is required to deposit the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount as calculated on Tuesday, even if there were a
	change in the price of bitcoin since Monday.


	Authorized Participants that create and redeem Baskets using the Conversion Procedures will
	pay a transaction fee of 1% of the Cash Exchange Rate times the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount (the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee). The 1% Liquidity Provider Fee is intended to cover all of a Liquidity Providers expenses in connection
	with the creation or redemption order, including any exchange fees that the Liquidity Provider incurs in connection with buying or selling bitcoins. Once the Authorized Participants Cash Collateral Amount is received by the Administrator, in
	the case of in-cash creation orders, and once the Administrator notifies a Liquidity Provider that an in-cash redemption order has been accepted, in the case of in-cash redemption orders, Authorized Participants will be obligated to accept the
	Liquidity Providers Cash Exchange Rate and will have no recourse against the Trust, Administrator or Liquidity Provider if they are dissatisfied with the Cash Exchange Rate. An in-cash creation or redemption order that has been accepted may
	only be subsequently cancelled or withdrawn if there is no Liquidity Provider able to transact in bitcoin and purchase the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount on behalf of the Authorized Participant.


	Authorized Participants must also pay a $500 transaction fee to the Administrator in connection with any creation or redemption order,
	regardless of the size of the order or whether the order is made in-cash or in-kind. This $500 transaction fee and the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee, in the case of in-cash orders, are the only fees that an Authorized Participant is required to pay in
	connection with the creation and redemption of Baskets. Authorized Participants who deposit bitcoins with the Trust in exchange for Baskets will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the
	Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares.


	The Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the whole and fractional
	bitcoins required for such creations and redemptions. The Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Sponsor and the relevant Authorized Participant. Under the Participant Agreement, the Sponsor agrees to
	indemnify each Authorized Participant against certain liabilities.


	The following description of the procedures for the creation and
	redemption of Baskets is only a summary and investors should refer to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement, Custodian Agreement and the form of Participant Agreement for more detail.



	Creation Procedures



	On any Business Day,
	an Authorized Participant may order one or more Creation Baskets from the Trust by placing a creation order with the Administrator. Creation orders may be placed either in-kind or in-cash, as described below.


	Creation orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m., New York time, for in-kind creations, and 4:59:59 p.m., New York time, for in-cash
	creations, on each Business Day. Authorized Participants may only create Baskets and cannot create any Shares in an amount less than a Basket.

	In-Kind Creations




	In-kind creations will take place as follows, where T is the trade date and each day in the sequence must be a Business Day:


	 














	T




	  




	T+1







	    The Authorized Participant places a creation order with the
	Administrator.


	 


	    The Marketing Agent accepts (or rejects) the creation order, which is communicated to
	the Authorized Participant by the Administrator.


	 


	    The Total Basket Bitcoin Amount is determined as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m.,
	New York time.



	  



	    The Authorized Participant transfers the Total Basket Bitcoin
	Amount from its Authorized Participant Self-Administered Account to the Custodian.


	 


	    Once the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount is received by the Custodian, the Administrator
	directs the Transfer Agent to credit the Creation Baskets to the Authorized Participants DTC account.








	In-Cash Creations




	Upon receiving instruction from the Administrator that a creation order has been accepted by the Marketing Agent, the Authorized Participant
	will send 110% of the U.S. Dollar value of the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, as calculated using the most recently published Bitcoin Index Price (the Cash Collateral Amount). Once the Cash Collateral Amount is received by the
	Administrator, the Sponsor will notify the Liquidity Provider of the creation order. The Liquidity Provider will then (i) determine the Cash Exchange Rate, which, in the case of a creation order, is the Index spot price at the time at which the Cash
	Collateral Amount is received by the Administrator, plus the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee, and (ii) provide a firm quote to the Authorized Participant for the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, determined by using the Cash Exchange Rate. If the Liquidity
	Providers quote is greater than the Cash Collateral Amount received, the Authorized Participant will be required to pay the difference on the same day. Under the Conversion Procedures, the Authorized Participant does not pay more than the firm
	quote provided by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider bears the risk of any change in the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount and of any change in the price of bitcoin once the Cash Exchange Rate has been determined. Provided that payment for the
	Total Basket Bitcoin Amount is received by the Administrator, the Liquidity Provider will deliver the bitcoins to the Custodian on the settlement date on behalf of the Authorized Participant. The Liquidity Provider may realize any arbitrage
	opportunity between the firm quote that it provides to the Authorized Participant and the price at which it sources the requisite bitcoin for the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount. After the Custodian receives the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, the
	Administrator will instruct the Transfer Agent to deliver the Creation Baskets to the Authorized Participant. The Administrator will then send the Liquidity Provider the cash equal to the Cash Exchange Rate times the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount,
	plus the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee. The Administrator will return any remaining amount of the Cash Collateral Amount to the Authorized Participant.

	the Authorized Participant by the Administrator.


	 


	    The Authorized Participant sends the Cash Collateral Amount to the Administrator.


	 


	    The Sponsor advises
	a Liquidity Provider that the Cash Collateral Amount has been deposited.


	 


	    The Liquidity Provider provides the Authorized Participant with the Cash Exchange Rate
	and a firm quote for the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount.


	 


	    If the Cash Collateral Amount deposited by the Authorized Participant is less than the
	firm quote provided by the Liquidity Provider, the Authorized Participant sends the difference between the Cash Collateral Amount deposited and the firm quote to the Administrator.


	 


	    The Liquidity
	Provider may begin purchasing bitcoins.



	  



	    The Total Basket Bitcoin Amount is determined as soon as practicable
	after 4:00 p.m., New York time.


	 


	    Prior to T+1, the Liquidity Provider must complete its purchase of the Total
	Basket Bitcoin Amount.


	 



	  



	    The Liquidity Provider delivers the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount to the
	Custodian.


	 


	    Once
	the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount is received by the Custodian, the Administrator directs the Transfer Agent to credit the Creation Baskets to the Authorized Participants DTC account.


	 


	    The Administrator
	sends the Liquidity Provider an amount of cash equal to the Cash Exchange Rate times the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, plus the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee, and returns any remaining amount of the Cash Collateral Amount to the Authorized
	Participant.








	Determination of Required Deposits




	The Basket Bitcoin Amount required for a Creation Basket will be determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m.,
	New York time, on the trade date of a creation or redemption order, as adjusted for the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time (the
	quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one bitcoin), and multiplying such quotient by 100. All questions as to the composition of a Basket Bitcoin Amount will be conclusively determined by the Sponsor and will be final and
	binding on all persons interested in the Trust.


	Deposits other than those received from an Authorized Participant Self-Administered
	Account or a Liquidity Provider Account will be rejected. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of bitcoins, until such bitcoins have been received and not rejected by the Trust, shall be borne solely by the Authorized
	Participant. The Custodian may accept delivery of bitcoins by such other means as the Sponsor, from time to time, may determine to be acceptable for the Trust.

	Redemption Procedures



	Effective October 28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which Shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of
	their Shares through Genesis, the sole Authorized Participant at that time, out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. On July 11, 2016, Genesis and the Trust entered into a settlement
	agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus
	prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. The Trust is seeking an exemption from the SEC under Regulation M in order to reinstate its redemption program, but cannot at this time predict whether it will be successful in obtaining
	such regulatory relief. If and when such regulatory relief is obtained, the following redemption procedures will apply.


	The
	procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place a redemption order specifying the number of Redemption Baskets
	to be redeemed. Redemption orders may be placed either in-kind or in-cash, as described below.


	Redemption
	orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m., New York time, for in-kind redemptions, and 4:59:59 p.m., New York time, for in-cash redemptions, on each Business Day. The Authorized Participants may only redeem Baskets and cannot redeem any
	Shares in an amount less than a Basket.






	In-Kind Redemptions




	In-kind redemptions will take place as follows, where T is the trade date and each day in the sequence must be a Business Day:


	 














	T




	  




	T+2







	    The Authorized Participant places a redemption order with the
	Administrator.


	 


	    The Marketing Agent accepts (or rejects) the redemption order.


	 


	    The Total Basket
	Bitcoin Amount is determined as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time.



	  



	    The Authorized Participant delivers to the Transfer Agent
	Redemption Baskets from its DTC account.


	 


	    Once the Redemption Baskets are received by the Transfer Agent, the Custodian transfers
	the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount to the Authorized Participant and the Transfer Agent cancels the Shares.








	In-Cash Redemptions




	To redeem Baskets using the Conversion Procedures, Authorized Participants will send the Administrator a redemption order. The Marketing Agent
	will accept or reject the redemption order on that same date. A Liquidity Provider will then (i) determine the Cash Exchange Rate, which, in the case of a redemption order, is the Index spot price minus the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee at the time at
	which the Administrator notifies the Authorized Participant that an order has been accepted and (ii) provide a firm quote to an Authorized Participant for the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, determined by using the Cash Exchange Rate. Under the
	Conversion Procedures, the Authorized Participant does not receive less than the firm quote provided by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider bears the risk of any change in the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount and of any change in the price of
	bitcoin once the Cash Exchange Rate has been determined.


	The Liquidity Provider will send the Administrator the cash proceeds equal
	to the Cash Exchange Rate times the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, minus the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee. The Liquidity Provider may realize any arbitrage opportunity between the firm quote that it provides to the Authorized Participant and the price at
	which it sells the requisite bitcoin for the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount. Once the Authorized Participant delivers the Redemption Baskets to the Transfer Agent, the Administrator will send the cash proceeds to the Authorized Participant and the
	Transfer Agent will cancel the Shares. At the instruction of the Administrator, the Custodian will then send the Liquidity Provider the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount.

	     The Liquidity Provider provides the Authorized Participant with the Cash Exchange
	Rate and a firm quote for the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount.


	 


	     The Liquidity Provider may begin selling bitcoins.


	 



	  



	     


	The Total Basket Bitcoin Amount is determined as soon as
	practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on T.


	 


	     Prior to T+2, Liquidity Provider must complete its sale of the Total
	Basket Bitcoin Amount.



	  



	     The Authorized Participant delivers to the Transfer Agent
	Redemption Baskets from its DTC account.


	 


	     The Liquidity Provider sends the Administrator the cash proceeds equal to Cash
	Exchange Rate times the Total Basket Bitcoin Amount, minus the 1% Liquidity Provider Fee.


	 


	     Once the Redemption Baskets are received by the Transfer Agent, the Administrator
	sends the above-mentioned cash proceeds to the Authorized Participant and the Transfer Agent cancels the Shares.


	 


	     The Custodian sends the Liquidity Provider the number of bitcoins equal to the
	Total Basket Bitcoin Amount.








	Determination of Redemption Distribution




	The Basket Bitcoin Amount required for a Redemption Basket will be determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00
	p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation or redemption order, as adjusted for the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time
	(the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one bitcoin), and multiplying such quotient by 100.


	Redemption
	distributions will be subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges that may be due. The Sponsor has final determination of all questions as to the composition of the number of bitcoins required for a Redemption
	Basket.



	Suspension or Rejection of Orders



	The creation or redemption of Shares may be suspended generally, or refused with respect to particular requested creations or redemptions,
	during any period when the transfer books of the Transfer Agent are closed or if circumstances outside the control of the Sponsor or its delegates make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process creation orders or redemption orders. The
	Administrator may reject an order if such order is not presented in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of counsel, might be unlawful. None of the Sponsor or its delegates will be
	liable for the suspension, rejection or acceptance of any creation order or redemption order.

	Tax Responsibility



	Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value-added tax or similar tax or
	governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of Baskets, regardless of whether such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor and the Trust if any Authorized Participant is
	required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax or interest thereon.

	VALUATION OF BITCOINS AND DEFINITION OF THE TRUSTS BITCOIN
	HOLDINGS



	The Administrator will evaluate the bitcoins held by the Trust and determine the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings in accordance
	with the relevant provisions of the Trust Documents. The following is a description of the material terms of the Trust Documents as they relate to valuation of the Trusts bitcoins and the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings calculations.


	On each business day at 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable (the Evaluation Time), the Administrator
	will evaluate the bitcoins held by the Trust and calculate and publish the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings. To calculate the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings, the Administrator will:


	 




	 


	1.


	Determine the Bitcoin Index Price;




	 




	 


	2.


	Multiply the Bitcoin Index Price by the aggregate number of bitcoins owned by the Trust as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the immediately preceding day;




	 




	 


	3.


	Add the U.S. Dollar value of bitcoins, as calculated using the Bitcoin Index Price, receivable under pending creation orders, if any, determined by multiplying the number of Creation Baskets represented by such
	creation orders by the Basket Bitcoin Amount and then multiplying such product by the Bitcoin Index Price;




	 




	 


	4.


	Subtract the U.S. Dollar value of the bitcoins, as calculated using the Bitcoin Index Price, constituting the Sponsors Fee, determined by multiplying the number of such bitcoins by the Bitcoin Index Price;




	 




	 


	5.


	Subtract the Additional Trust Expenses, if any; and




	 




	 


	6.


	Subtract the U.S. Dollar value of the bitcoins to be distributed under pending redemption orders, determined by multiplying the number of Redemption Baskets represented by such redemption orders by the Basket
	Bitcoin Amount and then multiplying such product by the Bitcoin Index Price.




	In the event that the Sponsor determines that
	the primary methodology used to determine the Bitcoin Index Price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trusts bitcoins, the Administrator will utilize the cascading set of rules as described in Overview of the Bitcoin
	Industry MarketBitcoin ValueThe Index and the Bitcoin Index Price.


	The Sponsor will publish the Bitcoin Index Price,
	the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and the Bitcoin Holdings per Share on the Trusts website as soon as practicable after its determination. If the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings and Bitcoin Holdings per Share have been calculated using a price
	per bitcoin other than the Bitcoin Index Price for such Evaluation Time, the publication on the Trusts website will note the valuation methodology used and the price per bitcoin resulting from such calculation.


	The determinations that the Sponsor and the Administrator make will be made in good faith upon the basis of, and neither the Sponsor nor the
	Administrator will be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. Neither the Sponsor nor the Administrator will be liable to DTC, Authorized Participants, the Shareholders or any other person for errors in judgment.
	However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Sponsor or the Administrator against any liability resulting from gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith in the performance of their duties.

	EXPENSES




	Expenses to Be Paid by the Sponsor



	The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following fees and expenses incurred by the Trust: the Marketing Fee, the Administrator Fee, the Custodian
	Fee, the Transfer Agent Fee, the Trustee fee, applicable license fees, including the licensing fees related to the Index License Agreement, fees and expenses related to public trading of the Shares on NYSE Arca (including marketing, legal and audit
	fees and expenses), legal expenses, audit fees, regulatory fees, including any fees relating to the registration of the Shares with the SEC, printing and mailing costs and costs of maintaining the Trusts website.



	Extraordinary and Other Expenses



	In
	certain extraordinary circumstances, the Trust may pay expenses in addition to the Sponsors Fee, including, but not limited to, any expenses of the Trust that are not assumed by the Sponsor, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs
	of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other Service Provider) on behalf of the Trust, indemnification expenses of the Custodian, Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust and
	extraordinary legal fees and expenses (collectively, Additional Trust Expenses). If Additional Trust Expenses are incurred, the Trust will be required to pay these Additional Trust Expenses by selling bitcoins. For purposes of paying any
	Additional Trust Expenses, bitcoins will be converted into U.S. Dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate at the time of conversion. Although the Sponsor cannot definitively state the frequency or magnitude of the Additional Trust
	Expenses, the Sponsor expects that they may occur infrequently, if at all.



	Disposition of Bitcoins



	To pay the Sponsors Fee, the Custodian will, when directed by the Sponsor, (i) withdraw from the Bitcoin Account the number of bitcoins
	with an aggregate U.S. Dollar value, as calculated using the Bitcoin Index Price, equal to the accrued but unpaid Sponsors Fee and (ii) transfer such bitcoins to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor. In addition, if the Trust
	incurs any Additional Trust Expenses, the Sponsor will cause the Custodian to convert bitcoins into U.S. Dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate, in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust
	Expenses. Shareholders do not have the option of choosing to pay their proportionate shares of Additional Trust Expenses in lieu of having their shares of Additional Trust Expenses paid by the Trusts disposition of bitcoins. Assuming that the
	Trust is treated a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transfer or sale of bitcoins to pay the Trusts expenses will be a taxable event for Shareholders. See U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesTax Consequences
	to U.S. Holders.


	Because the number of the Trusts bitcoins will decrease as a consequence of the payment of the
	Sponsors Fee in bitcoins or the sale of bitcoins to pay Additional Trust Expenses (and the Trust will incur additional fees associated with converting bitcoins into U.S. Dollars), the number of bitcoins represented by a Share will decline at
	such time and the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings may also decrease. Accordingly, the Shareholders will bear the cost of the Sponsors Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses.


	The Sponsor will also cause the sale of the Trusts bitcoins if the Sponsor determines that sale is required by applicable law or
	regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of the Trust. The Sponsor will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of bitcoins.

	BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SHARES




	The Securities Depository; Book-Entry-Only System; Global Security



	In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Trust Documents, the Trusts Shares have been and will only be issued in book-entry-only
	form, so that individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares but rather one or more global certificates will evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time.


	DTC will act as securities depository for the Shares. DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
	York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of section 17A of the Exchange Act.
	DTC was created to hold securities of DTC Participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in such securities among the DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes. This eliminates the need for physical movement
	of securities certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. Access to the DTC system is
	also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly. DTC is expected to agree with and represent to the DTC
	Participants that it will administer its book-entry system in accordance with its rules and by-laws and the requirements of law.


	Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates will be signed by the Transfer Agent on
	behalf of the Trust, registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, and deposited with the Transfer Agent on behalf of DTC. The global certificates will evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. The representations,
	undertakings and agreements made on the part of the Trust in the global certificates are made and intended for the purpose of binding only the Trust and not the Transfer Agent or the Sponsor individually.


	Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer or redemption of Shares, DTC will credit or debit, on its book-entry registration and
	transfer system, the amount of the Shares so created, transferred or redeemed to the accounts of the appropriate DTC Participants. The Transfer Agent and the Authorized Participants will designate the accounts to be credited and charged in the case
	of creation or redemption of Shares.


	Beneficial ownership of the Shares will be limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and
	persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Owners of beneficial interests in the Shares will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC
	Participants), the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants), and the records of Indirect Participants (with respect to Shareholders that are not DTC Participants or Indirect Participants). Shareholders are expected to
	receive from or through the DTC Participant maintaining the account through which the Shareholder has purchased their Shares a written confirmation relating to such purchase.


	Shareholders that are not DTC Participants may transfer the Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant or Indirect Participant
	through which the Shareholders hold their Shares to transfer the Shares. Shareholders that are DTC Participants may transfer the Shares by instructing DTC in accordance with the rules of DTC. Transfers of Shares will be made in accordance with
	standard securities industry practice.


	DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to Baskets and/or the Shares by
	giving notice to the Transfer Agent and the Sponsor. Under such circumstances, the Sponsor will find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if a replacement is unavailable, the Sponsor will act to terminate the
	Trust.


	 


	88







	Table of Contents



	The rights of the Shareholders generally must be exercised by DTC Participants acting on their
	behalf in accordance with the rules and procedures of DTC. Because the Shares can only be held in book-entry form through DTC and DTC Participants, investors must rely on DTC, DTC Participants and any other financial intermediary through which they
	hold the Shares to receive the benefits and exercise the rights described in this section. Investors should consult with their broker or financial institution to find out about procedures and requirements for securities held in book-entry form
	through DTC.

	STATEMENTS, FILINGS AND REPORTS




	Statements, Filings and Reports



	After
	the end of each fiscal year, the Sponsor will cause to be prepared an annual report containing audited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Trust. The annual report will be in such form and contain such information as
	will be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations and may contain such additional information which the Sponsor determines shall be included. The annual report shall be filed with the SEC and NYSE Arca and shall be distributed to such
	persons and in such manner, as shall be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations.


	The Sponsor is responsible for the
	registration and qualification of the Shares under the federal securities laws and any other securities and blue sky laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction as the Sponsor may select. The Sponsor will also prepare, or cause to be
	prepared, and file any periodic reports or updates required under the Exchange Act.


	The accounts of the Trust will be audited, as
	required by law and as may be directed by the Sponsor, by independent registered public accountants designated by the Sponsor. The accountants report will be furnished by the Sponsor to Shareholders upon request.


	The Sponsor will make elections, file tax returns and prepare, disseminate and file tax reports, as advised by its counsel or accountants
	and/or as required by any applicable statute, rule or regulation.



	Fiscal Year



	The fiscal year of the Trust is the period ending December 31 of each year. The Sponsor may select an alternate fiscal year.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST DOCUMENTS




	Description of the Trust Agreement



	The
	following is a description of the material terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement establishes the roles, rights and duties of the Sponsor and the Trustee.



	The Sponsor





	Liability of the
	Sponsor and Indemnification




	The Sponsor and its affiliates (each a Covered Person) will not be liable to the Trust or
	any Shareholder for any action taken, or for refraining from taking any action in good faith, having determined that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the
	Sponsor against any liability resulting from its own willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties.


	Each Covered Person will be indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against any loss, judgment, liability, expense incurred or amount paid
	in settlement of any claim sustained by it in connection with the Covered Persons activities for the Trust, without fraud, gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or a material breach of the Trust Agreement on the part of such
	indemnified party arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Trust Agreement and under each other agreement entered into by the Sponsor in furtherance of the administration of the Trust (including, without
	limiting the scope of the foregoing, any Participant Agreement) or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Such indemnity shall include payment from the Trust of the costs and expenses incurred by such indemnified
	party in defending itself against any claim or liability in its capacity as Sponsor. Any amounts payable to an indemnified party may be payable in advance or shall be secured by a lien on the Trust. The Sponsor may, in its discretion, undertake any
	action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of the Trust Agreement and the interests of the Shareholders and, in such event, the legal expenses and costs of any such actions shall be expenses and costs of the Trust and the Sponsor
	shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor by the Trust.




	Fiduciary and Regulatory Duties of the Sponsor




	The Sponsor is not effectively subject to the duties and restrictions imposed on fiduciaries under both statutory and common law.
	Rather, the general fiduciary duties that would apply to the Sponsor are defined and limited in scope by the Trust Agreement.


	The Trust
	Agreement provides that in addition to any other requirements of applicable law, no Shareholder shall have the right, power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Trust unless two or more
	Shareholders who (i) are not affiliates of one another and (ii) collectively hold at least 10% of the outstanding Shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action, suit or other proceeding.


	Beneficial owners may have the right, subject to certain legal requirements, to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights
	under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC. Beneficial owners who have suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of their beneficial interests may be able to recover such losses
	from the Sponsor where the losses result from a violation by the Sponsor of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.




	Actions Taken to Protect the Trust




	The Sponsor may, in its own discretion, prosecute, defend, settle or compromise actions or claims at law or in equity that it considers
	necessary or proper to protect the Trust or the interests of the Shareholders. The expenses incurred by the Sponsor in connection therewith (including the fees and disbursements of legal counsel) will be expenses of the Trust and are deemed to be
	Additional Trust Expenses. The Sponsor will be entitled to be reimbursed for the Additional Trust Expenses.


	 


	91







	Table of Contents





	Successor Sponsors




	If the Sponsor is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, the Trustee may terminate and liquidate the Trust and distribute its remaining assets.
	Neither the Trustee nor the Administrator has any obligation to appoint a successor sponsor or to assume the duties of the Sponsor, and will have no liability to any person because the Trust is or is not terminated as described in the preceding
	sentence.



	The Trustee



	The Trustee
	is a fiduciary under the Trust Agreement and must satisfy the requirements of Section 3807 of the Delaware Trust Statute. However, the fiduciary duties, responsibilities and liabilities of the Trustee are limited by, and are only those
	specifically set forth in, the Trust Agreement.




	Limitation on Trustees Liability




	Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has exclusive control of the management of all aspects of the activities of the Trust and the Trustee
	has only nominal duties and liabilities to the Trust. The Trustee is appointed to serve as the trustee for the sole purpose of satisfying Section 3807(a) of the DSTA which requires that the Trust have at least one trustee with a principal place
	of business in the State of Delaware. The duties of the Trustee are limited to (i) accepting legal process served on the Trust in the State of Delaware and (ii) the execution of any certificates required to be filed with the Delaware
	Secretary of State which the Trustee is required to execute under the DSTA.


	To the extent the Trustee has duties (including fiduciary
	duties) and liabilities to the Trust or the Shareholders under the DSTA, such duties and liabilities will be replaced by the duties and liabilities of the Trustee expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will have no obligation to
	supervise, nor will it be liable for, the acts or omissions of the Sponsor, Transfer Agent, Administrator, Custodian or any other person. Neither the Trustee, either in its capacity as trustee or in its individual capacity, nor any director, officer
	or controlling person of the Trustee is, or has any liability as, the issuer, director, officer or controlling person of the issuer of Shares. The Trustees liability is limited solely to the express obligations of the Trustee as set forth in
	the Trust Agreement.


	Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has the exclusive management, authority and control of all aspects of the
	activities of the Trust. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Sponsor, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. The existence of a trustee should not be taken as
	an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over the Trust. The Trust Agreement provides that the management authority with respect to the Trust is vested directly in the Sponsor. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee
	is not responsible or liable for the genuineness, enforceability, collectability, value, sufficiency, location or existence of any of the bitcoins or other assets of the Trust.




	Possible Repayment of Distributions Received by Shareholders; Indemnification by Shareholders




	The Shares are limited liability investments. Investors may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their
	investment. Although it is unlikely, the Sponsor may, from time to time, make distributions to the Shareholders. However, Shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of the Trust any distribution they
	received at a time when the Trust was in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In addition, the Trust Agreement provides that Shareholders will indemnify the Trust for any harm suffered by it as a result of Shareholders
	actions unrelated to the activities of the Trust.


	The foregoing repayment of distributions and indemnity provisions (other than the
	provision for Shareholders indemnifying the Trust for taxes imposed upon it by a state, local or foreign taxing authority, which


	 


	92







	Table of Contents



	is included only as a formality due to the fact that many states do not have statutory trust statutes therefore the tax status of the Trust in such states might, theoretically, be challenged) are
	commonplace in statutory trusts and limited partnerships.




	Indemnification of the Trustee




	The Trustee and any of the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Trustee shall be indemnified by the Trust as primary obligor and
	held harmless against any loss, damage, liability, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, disbursement (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), tax or penalty of any kind and nature whatsoever, arising out of, imposed upon or asserted
	at any time against such indemnified person in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Trust Agreement, the creation, operation or termination of the Trust or the transactions contemplated therein; provided, however, that
	neither the Trust nor DCG shall be required to indemnify any such indemnified person for any such expenses which are a result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such indemnified person. If the Trust shall have insufficient
	assets or improperly refuses to pay such an indemnified person within 60 days of a request for payment owed under the Trust Agreement, DCG shall, as secondary obligor, compensate or reimburse the Trustee or indemnify, defend and hold harmless such
	an indemnified person as if it were the primary obligor under the Trust Agreement. Any amount payable to such an indemnified person under the Trust Agreement may be payable in advance and shall be secured by a lien on the Trust property. The
	obligations of DCG and the Trust to indemnify such indemnified persons under the Trust Agreement shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement.






	Holding of Trust Property




	The Trust will hold and record the ownership of the Trusts assets in a manner such that it will be owned for the benefit of the
	Shareholders for the purposes of, and subject to and limited by the terms and conditions set forth in, the Trust Agreement. Other than issuance of the Shares, the Trust will not create, incur or assume any indebtedness or borrow money from or loan
	money to any person. The Trustee may not commingle its assets with those of any other person.


	The Trustee may employ agents, attorneys,
	accountants, auditors and nominees and will not be answerable for the conduct or misconduct of any such custodians, agents, attorneys or nominees if such custodians, agents, attorney and nominees have been selected with reasonable care.




	Resignation, Discharge or Removal of Trustee; Successor Trustees




	The Trustee may resign as Trustee by written notice of its election so to do, delivered to the Sponsor with at least 180 days notice. The
	Sponsor may remove the Trustee in its discretion. If the Trustee resigns or is removed, the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the Shareholders, shall appoint a successor trustee. The successor Trustee will become fully vested with all of the rights,
	powers, duties and obligations of the outgoing Trustee.


	If the Trustee resigns and no successor trustee is appointed within 180 days
	after the Trustee notifies the Sponsor of its resignation, the Trustee will terminate and liquidate the Trust and distribute its remaining assets.




	Amendments to the Trust Agreement




	The Trust Agreement can be amended by the Sponsor in its sole discretion and without the Shareholders consent by making an amendment, a
	Trust Agreement supplemental thereto, or an amended and restated trust agreement, provided that no such amendment or supplement may be made if it would adversely affect the status of the Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
	Any such restatement, amendment and/or supplement shall be effective on such date as designated by Sponsor in its sole discretion. However, any amendment to the Trust Agreement that affects the duties, liabilities, rights or protections of the

	Termination of the Trust




	The Trust will dissolve if any of the following events occur:


	 




	 


	


	 


	A U.S. federal or state regulator requires the Trust to shut down or forces the Trust to liquidate its bitcoins or seizes, impounds or otherwise restricts access to Trust assets;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Trust is determined to be a money service business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and is required to comply with certain FinCEN regulations
	thereunder, and the Sponsor has made the determination that dissolution of the Trust is advisable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Trust is required to obtain a license or make a registration under any state law regulating money transmitters, money services business, providers of prepaid or stored value or similar entities, or virtual currency
	businesses, and the Sponsor has made the determination that dissolution of the Trust is advisable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Any ongoing event exists that either prevents the Trust from making or makes impractical the Trusts reasonable efforts to make a fair determination of the Bitcoin Index Price;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Any ongoing event exists that either prevents the Trust from converting or makes impractical the Trusts reasonable efforts to convert bitcoins to U.S. Dollars;




	 




	 


	


	 


	A certificate of dissolution or revocation of the Sponsors charter is filed (and 90 days have passed after the date of notice to the Sponsor of revocation without a reinstatement of its charter) or upon the
	withdrawal, removal, adjudication or admission of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Sponsor, or an event of withdrawal unless (i) at the time there is at least one remaining Sponsor or (ii) within 90 days of such event of withdrawal
	Shareholders holding at least a majority of the Shares (not including Shares held by the Sponsor and its affiliates) agree in writing to continue the Trust and to select, effective as of the date of such event, one or more successor Sponsors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Shareholders holding at least 75% of the outstanding Shares notify the Sponsor that they elect to dissolve the Trust, notice of which is sent to the Sponsor not less than 90 days prior to the effective date of
	dissolution; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Custodian resigns or is removed without replacement.




	The Sponsor may, in its sole
	discretion, dissolve the Trust if any of the following events occur:


	 




	 


	


	 


	The SEC determines that the Trust is an investment company required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The CFTC determines that the Trust is a commodity pool under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the CEA);




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Trust becomes insolvent or bankrupt;

	All of the Trusts bitcoins are sold;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsor determines that the size of the Trust Estate in relation to the expenses of the Trust make it unreasonable or imprudent to continue the Trust;




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Sponsor receives notice from the IRS or from counsel for the Trust or the Sponsor that the Trust fails to qualify for treatment, or will not be treated, as a grantor trust under the Code; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	The Trustee notifies the Sponsor of the Trustees election to resign and the Sponsor does not appoint a successor trustee within 180 days.




	The death, legal disability, bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or withdrawal of any Shareholder (as long as such Shareholder is not the
	sole Shareholder of the Trust) shall not result in the termination of the Trust, and such Shareholder, his estate, custodian or personal representative shall have no right to withdraw or value such


	 


	94







	Table of Contents



	Shareholders Shares. Each Shareholder (and any assignee thereof) expressly agrees that in the event of his death, he waives on behalf of himself and his estate, and he directs the legal
	representative of his estate and any person interested therein to waive the furnishing of any inventory, accounting or appraisal of the assets of the Trust and any right to an audit or examination of the books of the Trust, except for such rights as
	are set forth in Article VIII of the Trust Agreement relating to the books of account and reports of the Trust.


	If the Trust is forced to
	liquidate, the Trust will be liquidated under the Sponsors direction. The Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, will engage directly with either accessible Bitcoin Exchanges or over-the-counter bitcoin markets to liquidate the Trusts bitcoin
	as promptly as possible while obtaining the best fair value possible. The proceeds therefrom will be applied and distributed in the following order of priority: (a) to the expenses of liquidation and termination and to creditors, including
	Shareholders who are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the Trust other than liabilities for distributions to Shareholders and (b) to the holders of Shares pro rata in accordance with the
	respective percentage of percentages of Shares that they hold. It is expected that the Sponsor would be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Trust, and therefore, the markets available to the Sponsor will be the same markets available
	to the Trust.




	Governing Law; Consent to New York Jurisdiction




	The Trust Agreement and the rights of the Sponsor, Trustee, DTC and Shareholders under the Trust Agreement are governed by the laws of the
	State of Delaware. The Custodian Agreement and Participant Agreements are governed by the laws of the state of New York. The Sponsor, the Trustee and DTC and, by accepting Shares, each DTC Participant and each Shareholder, consent to the
	jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and any federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.



	Description of the
	Custodian Agreement



	The Custodian Agreement establishes the rights and responsibilities of the Custodian, Sponsor, Trust and
	Authorized Participants with respect to the Custodial Coins in the Wallet Account and Vault Account, which together with any associated subaccounts, constitute the Trusts Bitcoin Account, which is maintained and operated by the Custodian on
	behalf of the Trust. For a general description of the Custodians obligations, see The CustodianThe Custodians Role.




	Location of Bitcoins; Accounts




	The Trusts bitcoins are stored on multi-signature addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain. The private keys required to transfer the
	Trusts bitcoins are stored in Vaults located around the world with physical, cryptographic and jurisdictional security layers.


	Vaults are located deep underground in geographically dispersed locations across the world, including but not limited to the United States,
	Europe, including Switzerland, and South America. Confidential information such as the private keys and cryptographic materials are physically stored on offline devices that never have and never will have access to the internet or any other kind of
	network. Vault locations are protected by extraordinary security measures, including human, biometric and automated systems, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Vaults incorporate multiple layers of the most advanced forms of cryptographic security,
	multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation. The geographic dispersion of vaults is designed to protect bitcoins from being seized by any government entity. Even if a government were to determine a way to bypass the physical and
	cryptographic layers of security in one jurisdiction, the other vault locations would remain uncompromised and the bitcoins would remain safe. For more information, see Custody of the Trusts Bitcoins.




	Access to the Bitcoin Account; Deposits, Withdrawals and Storage




	The Custodian will use its best efforts to keep in safe custody of the Custodial Coins. The Bitcoin Account will be controlled at all times by
	or on behalf of the Custodian by an affiliate of the Custodian. The Custodian


	 


	95







	Table of Contents



	Agreement provides that all Custodial Coins credited to the Bitcoin Account must be appropriately identified as being held for the Sponsor or Trust and held in the Bitcoin Account on a
	non-fungible basis. The Custodial Coins cannot be commingled with other bitcoins held by the Custodian and cannot be deposited or held with any third-party depository, custodian, clearance system or wallet without prior written consent of the
	Sponsor or Trust.


	The Sponsor or Trust will be able to transfer bitcoins from the Bitcoin Account to another bitcoin account that is not
	maintained or controlled by the Custodian. Except in the case of certain prohibited activities of the Trust and the Sponsor, the Custodian will not suspend the Trust or Sponsors access to the Bitcoin Account unless the Trust or Sponsor engages
	in certain prohibited activities, and any suspension of access to the Bitcoin Account that is not permitted will constitute a breach of the Custodian Agreement. The Custodian may restrict access or use of the Bitcoin Account by any Authorized
	Participants if, in the Custodians good faith belief, it is reasonably necessary to comply with the Custodians anti-money laundering programs and policies or any requirements under applicable law, and would, except with respect to the
	Trust or Sponsors actions that caused or contributed to such restriction, constitute a Loss as defined in the Custodian Agreement.


	The Custodian will provide the Sponsor and the Administrator with the information that is necessary for Authorized Participants and Liquidity
	Providers to make deposits to the Bitcoin Account. To support the Trusts ordinary course deposits and withdrawals, which involve deposits from and withdrawals to bitcoin accounts owned by Authorized Participants and Liquidity Providers, the
	Custodians services will allow the Sponsor and the Trust to receive a bitcoin address for deposits by Authorized Participants and Liquidity Providers, and to initiate withdrawals to bitcoin addresses controlled by Authorized Participants and
	Liquidity Providers. The Custodian will use its best efforts to design and put in place a secure procedure to allow the Sponsor and the Administrator to receive such addresses, and to facilitate such withdrawals.


	The Custodian Agreement provides that the Trust, the Sponsor and certain designated officers and employees of the Trust and Sponsor will be
	able to access the Bitcoin Account via the Custodians services at all times, in order to check information about the Bitcoin Account, add bitcoins to the Bitcoin Account, withdraw bitcoins from the Wallet Account and initiate withdrawal of
	bitcoins from the Vault Account. The Custodian Agreement further provides that the Trusts and Sponsors auditors or third-party accountants upon reasonable notice, have inspection rights to visit and inspect the Bitcoin Account. The
	Sponsor has exercised its inspection rights of two of the vault locations that comprise the Bitcoin Account.


	Under the Custodian
	Agreement, the Custodian will credit all bitcoins properly sent to the Custodian via the Custodians services by authorized persons. The Custodian will notify the Trust or Sponsor and the relevant authorized persons of the receipt and credit of
	Custodial Coins to the Bitcoin Account. Such credit will be made on the same business day as the transaction is finalized by the Bitcoin Network, except that transactions finalized after 5:00 p.m., New York time may be processed on the next business
	day.


	The Custodian will only allow withdrawals of bitcoins from the Bitcoin Account by authorized persons. Such withdrawals will be made
	on the same business day as the transaction is finalized by the Bitcoin Network, except that transactions finalized after 5:00 p.m., New York time may be processed on the next business day.




	Security of the Account




	Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian must use its best efforts to keep private and public keys secure, and may not disclose such keys
	to the Sponsor, Trust or any other individual or entity.


	The Trust, Sponsor and Custodian will comply with certain security procedures
	with respect to the delivery or authentication of instructions and will use its best efforts to reasonably safeguard any codes, passwords or similar devices. Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian must exercise best efforts in all Bitcoin
	Network transactions executed in connection with its services.


	 


	96







	Table of Contents





	Right to Refuse Transfers or Amend Transfer Procedures




	The Sponsor will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment
	of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. The Sponsor may suspend redemption orders if it determines, in its sole discretion, that a suspension is necessary or desirable. Suspension of redemption orders at any time and for any
	reason may have adverse effects on the Bitcoin Index Price and the Trusts Bitcoin Holdings of the Shares.




	Record Keeping




	The Custodian will keep appropriate records of its services pursuant to the Custodian Agreement, and such records must be retained
	by the Custodian for no less than seven years. The Custodian Agreement also provides that the Custodian will permit, to the extent it may legally do so, the Trust or Sponsors auditors or third-party accountants, upon reasonable notice, to
	inspect, take extracts from and audit the records that it maintains. The Custodian is obligated to provide a copy of any audit report prepared by its internal or independent auditors to the Trust or Sponsor.


	Once per calendar year, the Sponsor or Trust may request that the Custodian deliver a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer to
	certify that the Custodian has complied and is currently in compliance with the Custodian Agreement and that all representations and warranties made by that Custodian in the Custodian Agreement are true and correct as of the certificate date and
	have been true and correct throughout the preceding year. The Sponsor and Trust are further entitled to request, not more than once per calendar year, that the Custodian produce or commission a new Services Organization Controls 1 report and
	promptly deliver it to the Sponsor and Trust within a reasonable term that shall not be less than 30 days.




	Standard of Care;
	Limitations of Liability




	The Custodian will use best efforts in performing its obligations under the Custodian Agreement. The
	Custodian is liable to the Sponsor and the Trust for the loss of any Custodial Coins to the extent that the Custodian caused such loss, even if the Custodian meets its duty of exercising best efforts.


	The Sponsor, Trust or Custodians total liability under the Custodian Agreement will never exceed the greater of the fair market value of
	the amount of Custodial Coins either at the time in which events giving rise to the liability occurred or at the time the Custodian notifies the Sponsor or Trust in writing or the Sponsor or Trust otherwise has actual knowledge of the events giving
	rise to the liability. The Custodian, Sponsor and Trust are not liable to each other for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages whether or not such losses were foreseeable or within contemplation of the parties. Furthermore, the
	Custodian is not responsible or liable to the Trust and the Sponsor for a failure or inability to perform under the Custodian Agreement or for loss of Custodial Coins due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control when exercising best efforts,
	including acts of God, terrorist activities, war, rebellion or military or usurped power or confiscation. A cybersecurity attack, hack or other intrusion by a third party or by someone associated with Custodian is not a circumstance that is beyond
	Custodians reasonable control when exercising best efforts.


	Pursuant to the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian does not guarantee
	the value of the Custodial Coins. The Custodian is not responsible for the services provided by the Bitcoin Network, such as verifying and confirming transactions that are submitted to the Bitcoin Network. Furthermore, the Custodian cannot cancel or
	reverse a transaction that has been submitted to the Bitcoin Network. To the extent the Custodian does not cause or contribute to a loss that the Trust or Sponsor suffers in connection with any bitcoin transaction initiated pursuant to the
	Custodians services, the Custodian will have no liability for such loss.




	Indemnity




	Each of the Custodian and the Sponsor and the Trust has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the other such parties from and against any and
	all damages arising out of or caused by (whether directly or indirectly) a third-party


	 


	97







	Table of Contents



	claim relating to the nonperformance or misperformance by the Custodian, Sponsor or Trust, as the case may be, of its duties and obligations under the Custodian Agreement as well as a
	partys reasonable reliance on any representations or warranties made by the Custodian, the Sponsor or Trust, as the case may be, under the Custodian Agreement that were or are in fact untrue. The Custodian has further agreed to indemnify and
	hold harmless the Sponsor and Trust from and against any and all damages arising out of or caused by a third-party claim relating to the holding of the Trusts bitcoins by the Custodian, including any loss or damage caused by any act or
	omission of any employee of the Custodian or any agent, representative or independent contractor engaged by the Custodian, whether or not such act or omission occurred within the scope of his employment or engagement.




	Fees and Expenses




	The Custodian is entitled to fees for services, which may be increased upon 60 days written notice to the Sponsor or Trust. The Custodian must
	receive its fees within 30 days of the Custodians invoice. The Sponsor and the Trust will be liable for all taxes with respect to any bitcoins held on its behalf or any transaction related to these bitcoins. The Trust, as primary obligor, and
	the Sponsor as secondary obligor, will indemnify the Custodian for any damages related to any such tax, other than a tax arising out of the Custodians negligence or willful misconduct.




	Termination




	The
	Custodian Agreement provides for annual, automatically renewable terms. Generally, the Custodian, Trust or Sponsor may terminate the Custodian Agreement for any reason upon 60 days written prior notice. In certain situations, including a
	material breach or failure to perform obligations of the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian, Sponsor and Trust may terminate the Custodian Agreement immediately after providing written notice. Upon termination of the Custodian Agreement, the
	Custodian must promptly deliver all the Trusts bitcoins to the Sponsor or Trust as of the effective date of termination, together with copies of the records maintained pursuant to the Custodian Agreement.




	Governing Law




	The
	Custodian Agreement is governed by New York law.

	U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES



	Subject to the discussion below in Tax Treatment of the Trust and Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment
	of Bitcoins, the following discussion constitutes the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, special tax counsel to the Trust, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership of Shares. This discussion does
	not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a beneficial owner of Shares in light of the beneficial owners particular circumstances, including tax consequences applicable to beneficial owners subject to special rules, such
	as:


	 




	 


	


	 


	financial institutions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	dealers in securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	traders in securities or commodities that have elected to apply a mark-to-market method of tax accounting in respect thereof;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons holding Shares as part of a hedge, straddle, integrated transaction or similar transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons holding Shares acquired by them as part of a Creation Basket or redeeming Shares in exchange for the underlying bitcoins represented by the redeemed Shares;




	 




	 


	


	 


	U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;




	 




	 


	


	 


	entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;




	 




	 


	


	 


	real estate investment trusts;




	 




	 


	


	 


	regulated investment companies; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	tax-exempt entities, including individual retirement accounts.




	This discussion applies only
	to Shares that are held as capital assets and does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or consequences of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income.


	If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Shares, the U.S. federal income tax
	treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Shares and partners in those partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisers about the particular U.S. federal
	income tax consequences of owning Shares.


	This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and
	final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the date hereof may affect the tax consequences described herein. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers about the
	application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.



	Tax Treatment of the Trust



	The Sponsor
	intends to take the position that the Trust will be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, a

	pro rata

	portion of the Trusts income, gain, losses and deductions will flow through to each beneficial owner of Shares.


	Recent amendments to the Trust Agreement were intended to clarify the Trusts classification as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes. To eliminate any ambiguity that the Trust, since its formation, has been intended to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust petitioned for, and was granted on February 9, 2017, an order of
	the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware reforming the Trust Agreement, retroactively to September 25, 2013 (the date of the original Trust Agreement), to conform to the


	 


	99







	Table of Contents



	amendments described in the preceding sentence. However, special tax counsel to the Trust expresses no opinion as to whether, and the IRS or a court might not agree that, the Trust is properly
	treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust is seeking a ruling from the IRS that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the Trust will be successful in
	obtaining such a ruling.


	If the IRS were successful in asserting that the Trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust
	might be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although due to the uncertain treatment of bitcoins for U.S. federal income tax purposes (discussed below), there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were
	classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including
	with respect to timing. In addition, tax information reports provided to Shareholders would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be
	classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at a maximum rate of 35%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to
	Shareholders would be taxable as dividends to the extent of the Trusts current and accumulated earnings and profits (which, in the case of Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below), generally would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30%
	rate (or a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty)).


	The remainder of this discussion is based on the assumption that the
	Trust will be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



	Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Bitcoins



	As discussed below, each beneficial owner of Shares generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of an
	undivided interest in the bitcoins held in the Trust. Many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoins are uncertain, and the Sponsor does not intend to request a ruling from the IRS on these issues. On March 25,
	2014, the IRS released a notice (the Notice), which discusses certain aspects of the treatment of virtual currencies, such as bitcoins, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Notice, the IRS stated that, for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, (i) bitcoins are property that is not currency and (ii) bitcoins may be held as capital assets. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not alter its position with respect to bitcoins in the future or
	that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the Notice. In addition, legislation has been introduced that would, if enacted, cause bitcoins to be treated as currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If bitcoins were properly treated as
	currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, gain recognized on the disposition of bitcoins would constitute ordinary income, and losses recognized on the disposition of bitcoin could be subject to special reporting requirements applicable to
	reportable transactions. The remainder of this discussion assumes that bitcoins are properly treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as property that is not currency. Special tax counsel to the Trust expresses no opinion regarding
	these aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoins.


	The Notice does not address other significant aspects of the U.S.
	federal income tax treatment of bitcoins, including: (i) whether bitcoins are properly treated as commodities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) whether bitcoins are properly treated as collectibles for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes; (iii) the proper method of determining a holders holding period and tax basis for bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices; and (iv) whether and how a holder of bitcoins acquired at
	different times or at varying prices may designate, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which of the bitcoins is transferred in a subsequent sale, exchange or other disposition.


	Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the substantial uncertainty regarding the tax consequences of an
	investment in bitcoins.

	Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders



	As used herein, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of a Share for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is:


	 




	 


	


	 


	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.




	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each U.S. Holder will be treated as the owner of an undivided interest in the bitcoins held in the Trust
	and will be treated as directly realizing its

	pro rata

	share of the Trusts income, gains, losses and deductions. When a U.S. Holder purchases Shares for cash, the U.S. Holders initial tax basis in its

	pro rata

	share of the
	bitcoins held in the Trust will be equal to the amount paid for the Shares.

	This discussion assumes that each U.S. Holder will acquire all of its Shares for cash on the same date and at the same price per Share. U.S. Holders that acquire, or
	contemplate acquiring, multiple lots of Shares at different times or prices are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding their tax bases and holding periods in their



	pro rata



	shares of the bitcoins held in the Trust.



	When the Trust transfers bitcoins to the Sponsor as payment of the Sponsors Fee, or sells bitcoins to fund payment of any
	Additional Trust Expenses, each U.S. Holder will be treated as having sold its

	pro rata

	share of those bitcoins for their fair market value at that time (which, in the case of bitcoins sold by the Trust, generally will be equal to the cash
	proceeds received by the Trust in respect thereof). As a result, each U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the U.S. Holders

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins
	that were transferred and (ii) the U.S. Holders tax basis for its

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins that were transferred. Assuming that bitcoins are not treated as currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any such gain or loss
	will generally be short-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held its Shares for one year or less and long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held its Shares for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses may
	be subject to significant limitations. A U.S. Holders tax basis in its

	pro rata

	share of any bitcoins transferred by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the tax basis of the U.S. Holders

	pro rata

	share of
	all of the bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to the transfer by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of bitcoins transferred and the denominator of which is the total amount of bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to
	the transfer. Immediately after the transfer, the U.S. Holders tax basis in its

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins remaining in the Trust will be equal to the tax basis in its

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins held in the Trust
	immediately prior to the transfer, less the portion of that tax basis allocable to its

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins transferred.


	U.S. Holders may deduct their respective

	pro rata

	shares of the expenses incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if the expenses
	were directly incurred by the U.S. Holders. U.S. Holders

	pro rata

	shares of the expenses incurred by the Trust will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a U.S. Holder is an
	individual, trust or estate, the U.S. Holders share of these expenses will be deductible for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent that the U.S. Holders share of the expenses, when combined with other
	miscellaneous itemized deductions, exceeds 2% of the U.S. Holders adjusted gross income for the particular year, will not be deductible for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax purposes and will be subject to certain other
	limitations on deductibility.


	On a sale or other disposition of Shares, a U.S. Holder will be treated as having sold the bitcoins
	underlying such Shares. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the sale of the Shares and (ii) the portion of the U.S. Holders tax
	basis in its

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins held in the Trust that is attributable to the Shares disposed of. Such tax basis generally will be determined by multiplying the tax basis of the U.S. Holders

	pro rata

	share of all of
	the bitcoins held by the Trust immediately prior to such sale or other disposition by a fraction the numerator of


	 


	101







	Table of Contents



	which is the number of Shares disposed of and the denominator of which is the total number of Shares held by such U.S. Holder immediately prior to such sale or other disposition. Assuming that
	bitcoins are not treated as currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that gain or loss will generally be short-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held its Shares for one year or less and long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
	Holder has held its Shares for more than one year.


	After any sale (or other disposition) of fewer than all of a U.S. Holders
	Shares, the U.S. Holders tax basis in its

	pro rata

	share of the bitcoins held in the Trust immediately after the sale (or other disposition) generally will equal the tax basis in its

	pro rata

	share of the total amount of the
	bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of that tax basis that is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the U.S. Holder upon the sale (or other disposition) (or, in the case of
	a redemption, which is treated as the basis of the bitcoins received by the Shareholder in the redemption).


	Any brokerage or other
	transaction fee incurred by a U.S. Holder in purchasing Shares will be added to the U.S. Holders tax basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee or other transaction fee incurred by a U.S. Holder in selling Shares
	will reduce the amount realized by the U.S. Holder with respect to the sale.



	Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders



	As used herein, the term non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of a Share for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is, for such
	purposes:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a nonresident alien individual;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a foreign corporation; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a foreign estate or trust.




	The term non-U.S. Holder does not include
	(i) nonresident alien individuals present in the United States for 183 days or more in a taxable year, (ii) former U.S. citizens and certain expatriated entities or (iii) persons whose Shares are effectively connected with the conduct
	of a trade or business in the United States. Prospective investors described in the preceding sentence should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning Shares.


	The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income other than gain (if any) that will be recognized on the transfer of bitcoins in payment
	of the Sponsors Fee and the sale of bitcoins in connection with the payment of any Additional Trust Expenses. A non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to any such gain or with
	respect to any gain the non-U.S. Holder recognizes upon a sale of Shares.



	U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding



	The Trust or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS and provide holders of Shares with information regarding
	their shares of the Trusts annual income (if any) and expenses in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations.


	A U.S. Holder
	may be subject to backup withholding in certain circumstances if it fails to provide its taxpayer identification number or to comply with certain certification procedures. In order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding
	requirements, a non-U.S. Holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a U.S. person. The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against the holders U.S. federal income tax liability
	and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

	ERISA AND RELATED CONSIDERATIONS



	The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on
	employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans, and certain collective investment funds or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or
	arrangements are invested, that are subject to ERISA and/or the Code (collectively, Plans), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as plan assets of a Plan. Government plans and
	some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state or other federal law.


	In contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should
	carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan, the Risk Factors discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, including, but not limited to
	(1) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument, (2) whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect non-exempt prohibited transaction with a party in
	interest, (3) the Plans funding objectives, and (4) whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment
	policy of the Plan, the composition of the Plans investment portfolio and the Plans need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due.


	It is anticipated that the Shares will constitute publicly-held offered securities as defined in the Department of Labor
	Regulations § 2510.3-101(b)(2). Accordingly, Shares purchased by a Plan, and not the Plans interest in the underlying bitcoins held in the Trust represented by the Shares, should be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying
	the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code.



	Investment by Certain Retirement Plans



	Individual retirement accounts (IRA) and participant-directed accounts under tax-qualified retirement plans are limited in the types
	of investments they may make under the Code. Potential purchasers of Shares that are IRAs or participant-directed accounts under a Code section 401(a) plan should consult with their own tax advisors as to the consequences of a purchase of Shares.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	The Trust issues Shares in Baskets only to Authorized Participants in exchange for deposits of bitcoins on a continuous basis. The Trust does
	not issue fractions of a Basket. Because new Shares can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Trust, a distribution, as such term is used in the Securities Act, will be occurring. Authorized
	Participants, other broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some of their activities will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
	prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, an Authorized Participant, other broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a Basket from the Trust, breaks the Basket down
	into its constituent Shares and sells the Shares directly to its customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a new Basket with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the Shares. A determination of
	whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be
	considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act.


	Investors that purchase shares through a brokerage account (whether commission based or fee-based) may pay commissions or fees charged by the
	brokerage account.


	Dealers that are not underwriters but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary
	secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing with Shares that are part of an unsold allotment within the meaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption
	provided by Section 4(3) of the Securities Act.


	The Sponsor intends to qualify the Shares in states selected by the Sponsor and that
	sales be made through broker-dealers who are members of FINRA. Investors intending to create or redeem Baskets through Authorized Participants in transactions not involving a broker-dealer registered in such investors state of domicile or
	residence should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable broker-dealer or securities regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption.


	The offering of Baskets is being made in compliance with Conduct Rule 2310 of FINRA. Authorized Participants will not receive from the Trust
	or the Sponsor any compensation in connection with an offering or reoffering of the Shares. Accordingly, there is, and will be, no payment of underwriting compensation in connection with any such offering of Shares in excess of 10% of the gross
	proceeds of the offering.


	Pursuant to a Marketing Agent Agreement (the Marketing Agent Agreement) entered into between the
	Sponsor and ALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc., as Marketing Agent, ALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc. will be paid by the Sponsor an annual fee. In addition, the Sponsor will pay certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the
	Marketing Agent incurred in connection with its assistance in the marketing of the Trust and its Shares.


	Under the Marketing Agent
	Agreement, the Marketing Agent will provide the following services to the Sponsor:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Review marketing related legal documents and contracts;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Consult with the Sponsors marketing staff and on development of FINRA compliant marketing campaigns;

	Review and file applicable marketing materials with FINRA;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Maintain, reproduce and store applicable books and records related to the services provided under the Marketing Agent Agreement;

	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	Develop an overall strategic sales and marketing plan;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Supervise sales related activities; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Provide a dedicated national accounts manager, certain shared external wholesalers, certain shared internal wholesalers, resources from its call center, marketing staff and resources from its order desk to assist in
	various aspects of its services under the Marketing Agent Agreement.




	The Shares will be listed and trade on NYSE Arca under the symbol
	GBTC.



	Selling Shareholders



	Certain selling shareholders are registering             Shares for possible sale.
	Unless the context otherwise requires, as used in this prospectus, the selling shareholders includes donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest selling Shares received from the selling shareholders as a gift, pledge,
	partnership distribution or other transfer after the date of this prospectus.


	The selling shareholders may offer and sell all or a
	portion of the Shares covered by this prospectus from time to time, in one or more or any combination of the following transactions:


	 




	 


	


	 


	On the NYSE Arca, the OTCQX, in the over-the-counter market or on any other national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or traded;




	 




	 


	


	 


	In privately negotiated transactions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	In underwritten transactions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	In a block trade in which a broker-dealer will attempt to sell the offered Shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Through purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account pursuant to this prospectus;




	 




	 


	


	 


	In ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Through the writing of options (including put or call options), whether the options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise.




	The selling shareholders may sell the Shares at prices then prevailing or related to the then current market price or at negotiated prices.
	The offering price of the Shares from time to time will be determined by the selling shareholders and, at the time of the determination, may be higher or lower than the market price of our Shares on the NYSE Arca or any other exchange or market.


	The Shares may be sold directly or through broker-dealers acting as principal or agent, or pursuant to a distribution by one or more
	underwriters on a firm commitment or best-efforts basis. The selling shareholders may also enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers. In connection with such transactions, broker-dealers of other financial institutions may engage in short
	sales of the Shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling shareholders. The selling shareholders may also enter into options or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions which require the
	delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of Shares offered by this prospectus, which Shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such
	transaction). In connection with an underwritten offering, the underwriters or agents may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling shareholder or from purchasers of the offered Shares for whom they
	may act as agents. In addition, underwriters may sell the Shares to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom
	they may act as agents. Any underwriters, dealers or agents

	participating in a distribution of the Shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any profit on the sale of the Shares and any commissions
	received by broker-dealers may be deemed to be underwriting commissions under the Securities Act. A selling shareholder may also be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act.


	The selling shareholders may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the Shares owned by them and, if they default in the
	performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the Shares from time to time pursuant to this prospectus or any amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended, amending, if necessary, the list of selling shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling shareholders under this prospectus. The selling shareholders also may transfer
	and donate the Shares in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.


	The selling shareholders may agree to indemnify an underwriter, broker-dealer or agent against certain liabilities related to the selling of
	the Shares, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.


	The Sponsor is not aware of any existing arrangements between the
	selling shareholders or any other shareholder, broker, dealer, underwriter or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the Shares offered by this prospectus.


	Under the securities laws of some states, the Shares may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In
	addition, in some states the Shares may not be sold unless such Shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with.


	The selling shareholders are subject to the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act,
	including Regulation M. This regulation may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the Shares offered in this prospectus by the selling shareholders and any other person. The anti-manipulation rules under the Exchange Act may apply to
	sales of Shares in the market and to the activities of the selling shareholders and their affiliates.

	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST








	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	1. Organization



	The Bitcoin Investment Trust (the
	Trust), a Delaware Trust that commenced operations on September 25, 2013, is an investment trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin. The Trust holds bitcoins and, from time to time, issues shares (Shares) (in
	minimum denominations of 100, referred to as Baskets) in exchange for deposits of bitcoins and distributes bitcoins in connection with redemptions of Baskets (see Note 4 for current creation and redemption restriction). Shares of the
	Trust represent common units of fractional undivided beneficial interests in the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the market price of bitcoin, less the Trusts expenses.


	Grayscale Investments LLC (Grayscale or the Sponsor) acts as the sponsor of the Trust and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital
	Currency Group, Inc. (DCG). The Sponsor monitors the overall performance of the Trust. Grayscale is responsible for preparing and providing quarterly and annual reports on behalf of the Trust to investors. Grayscale is also responsible
	for selecting and monitoring the Trusts service providers. As payment for its services, Grayscale charges the Trust fees as discussed in Note 6.


	Authorized Participants of the Trust are the only entities who may place orders to create or redeem Baskets. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (Genesis
	or the Authorized Participant), a registered broker dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, continues to be the only Authorized Participant and is party to a participant agreement with the Sponsor and the Trust. On January 20,
	2017, the Trust filed a registration statement on Form

	S-1

	with the Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Trust has engaged KCG Americas LLC, Wedbush Securities and Credit Suisse Securities
	(USA) LLC to act as Authorized Participants if the SEC declares the registration statement on Form

	S-1,

	as amended, effective. Additional Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the
	discretion of the Sponsor. Additionally, upon effectiveness of the registration statement on Form

	S-1,

	Genesis will cease to act as Authorized Participant and Genesis will become a liquidity provider
	facilitating the purchase and sale of bitcoins on behalf of Authorized Participants (see Note 6). There can be no assurances that the registration statement on Form

	S-1

	will ever be declared effective by the
	SEC.


	The custodian of the Trust (the Custodian) is responsible for safeguarding the bitcoin held by the Trust. The Custodian since
	August 9, 2015 has been Xapo, Inc. (Xapo), a third party provider.


	The transfer agent for the Trust is Continental Stock Transfer
	Corporation. The responsibilities of the transfer agent are to maintain creations, redemptions, and transfers of the Trusts shares in book form. The Trust has engaged Bank of New York Mellon to act as transfer agent and administrator to the
	Trust upon effectiveness of the registration statement on Form

	S-1.



	On March 25, 2015 the Trust received
	notice that its shares have been qualified for public trading on the OTCQX U.S. Premier Marketplace of the OTC Markets Group Inc. (OTCQX). The Trusts trading symbol on OTCQX is GBTC and the CUSIP number for its shares
	is 09173T108.



	2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	In the opinion of management of the sponsor of the Trust, Grayscale Investments, LLC (the Sponsor), all adjustments (which include normal recurring
	adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and changes in net assets as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and for all periods presented have been made.


	 


	F-6







	Table of Contents




	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust:


	The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The Trust qualifies as an
	investment company for accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. The Trust is not registered under the Investment Company Act of
	1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	The Trust conducts its transactions in bitcoins, including receiving bitcoins for the creation of shares, payment of bitcoins for the redemption of shares,
	and payment of fees in bitcoins. Since its inception, the Trust has not held cash or cash equivalents.


	The Trust classifies its investment in bitcoin as
	a commodity, which is consistent with the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions indication that bitcoin is considered a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act.



	Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition



	The
	Trust considers its investment transactions to be the receipt of bitcoins for share creations and the payment of bitcoins for share redemptions or as payment of expenses. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and
	changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using an average cost method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with
	transactions including settling obligations for fees in bitcoin and Share redemptions.



	Fair Value Measurement



	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date.


	U.S. GAAP utilizes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that
	maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
	based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trusts assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information
	available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 1  Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are
	readily and regularly available in an active market, these valuations do not entail a significant degree of judgment.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 2  Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 3  Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.




	 


	F-7







	Table of Contents




	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary by investment. To the extent that
	valuations are based on sources that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Fair value estimates do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized by the
	Trust.

	3. Fair Value of Bitcoin



	Bitcoins are held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust and are carried at fair value. As of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 the Trust held
	174,174.73532752 and 172,094.67544221 bitcoins, respectively. The Trust determined the fair value per bitcoin to be $1,084.70 on March 31, 2017, and $966.02 on December 31, 2016 using the price provided at 4:00 PM in New York by the
	bitcoin market considered to be the Trusts principal market. To determine which exchange is the Trusts principal market for purposes of calculating the Trusts NAV, the Trust considers only bitcoin markets that are U.S.
	Dollar-denominated, have an online platform and publish transaction price and volume data publicly. Based on these requirements, the Trust prepares a list of eligible bitcoin markets and considers the following criteria to select its principal
	market: (i) the volume of bitcoins traded on a bitcoin market in the prior twelve months, (ii) a bitcoin markets regulatory compliance with applicable federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding anti-money
	laundering procedures and (iii) the degree of

	intra-day

	price fluctuations a bitcoin market experiences as well as the degree of variance in prices across bitcoin exchanges.


	In determining which of the eligible bitcoin market is the Trusts principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order:


	First, the Trust sorts the list of eligible bitcoin markets from high to low by volume of bitcoins traded on each bitcoin market in the prior twelve months.
	The Trust moves down the list until it reaches a bitcoin market that has a volume of bitcoins traded for the prior twelve months that is less than 10% of the next largest bitcoin market and excludes this and all smaller bitcoin exchanges from the
	list. However, the list will always contain a minimum of three bitcoin markets, even if the percentage of volume drops to less than 10% of the next largest bitcoin market.


	Second, the Trust reviews the remaining bitcoin markets and excludes any bitcoin markets that do not comply with the federal and state licensing requirements
	that are applicable to the Trust and the Authorized Participant(s). The Trust or an Authorized Participant can only do business with those bitcoin markets that meet the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the Trust or an Authorized
	Participant is registered to do business. The Trust also assesses each bitcoin markets practices regarding anti-money laundering procedures.


	Third,
	the Trust then reviews

	intra-day

	pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on bitcoin markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a
	particular bitcoin market. The Trust then selects a bitcoin market as its principal market based on highest trade volume and price stability in comparison to the other bitcoin markets on the list.

	Table of Contents




	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	The Trust determines its principal market annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine if
	(i) there have been recent changes to each bitcoin markets transaction volume in the prior twelve months, (ii) if any bitcoin markets have fallen out of, or come into, compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, (iii) if
	the Trust has engaged any new Authorized Participant that, due to being registered to do business in another jurisdiction, would make bitcoin markets previously inaccessible to the Trust now accessible or (iv) if recent changes to each bitcoin
	markets price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trusts determination of its principal market.


	Historically, the Trust considered Bitstamp to be its principal market. The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at December 31, 2016,
	and identified a change in the principal market from Bitstamp to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX) (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange). The Trust has applied this change in principal market effective December 31, 2016. As of
	March 31, 2017, GDAX remained the principal market and the Trust has valued bitcoin at March 31, 2017 using the GDAX exchange.

	4. Creations and Redemptions of Shares



	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there was an unlimited number of Shares authorized by the Trust. The Trust creates and redeems Shares from
	time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets on behalf of investors are made by the Authorized Participant in exchange for the delivery of bitcoins to the Trust or the distribution of bitcoins by the Trust.
	The number of bitcoins required for each creation basket or redemption basket is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at such time by the number of Shares outstanding at such time and multiplying the quotient obtained by
	100. Each share represented approximately 0.093 and 0.094 of a bitcoin at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.


	The cost basis of
	investments in bitcoin recorded by the Trust is the fair value of bitcoin at 4:00 PM New York time on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant, as determined by the Trusts principal market. The cost basis recorded by the
	Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating and redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the
	value of Shares or bitcoins.


	Effective October 28, 2014 the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which Shareholders were permitted to request
	the redemption of their Shares through the Authorized Participant out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act. The Authorized
	Participant/

	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	Distributor and the Trusts sponsor are in discussions with the staff of the Securities Exchange Commission in order to resolve the concern, although the Distributor/Authorized Participant
	and the Trust cannot at this time predict whether the Trust will be permitted to reinstate the Share redemption program for the benefit of Shareholders or the impact such a resolution may have on their respective activities.


	On January 19, 2017, prior to the initial filing of the registration statement on Form

	S-1

	with the SEC, the
	Trust stopped issuing shares under the creation program, which had been taking place through private placement transactions.



	5. Income Taxes



	The Trust is treated as a grantor trust and the shareholders will be treated as owning proportionate interests in the Trust for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes. The Trust, therefore, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.


	Instead, each Shareholder will be deemed to acquire and hold a
	proportionate interest in the Trusts assets and will be required to report its proportionate share of the Trusts gains, income, losses and expenses on its U.S. federal income tax returns in accordance with the shareholders method
	of accounting.


	However, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will agree with this conclusion and it is
	possible that the IRS could assert a position to the contrary to one or all of those conclusions and that a court could sustain that contrary conclusion.


	As of January 1, 2016, an amendment to the Trust Agreement was made regarding certain tax provisions. On February 9, 2017, the Court of Chancery of
	the State of Delaware ordered that the Original Trust Agreement be reformed so that the amendments made shall be retroactive to the original date of execution of the agreement. The Trust is seeking a private letter ruling (PLR) from the
	IRS regarding certainty for its tax position through a PLR request sent to the IRS in the first quarter of 2017. The Trust is unable to predict a timeline of when a ruling will occur or whether a favorable outcome will be received. The Sponsor of
	the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.



	6. Related Parties



	The Trust considers the
	following entities and their directors to be related parties of the Trust: DCG, DCG Holdco Inc. (DCG Holdco), Genesis and Grayscale. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 199,297 and 217,512 shares of the Trust were held
	by related parties of the Trust, respectively.


	In accordance with the Trust agreement, the Trust pays a Management Fee to the Sponsor, calculated as 2%
	of aggregate value of the Trusts assets, less liabilities (which includes any accrued but unpaid expenses), as calculated and published by the Sponsor or its delegates (the Combined Fee). The Combined Fee accrues daily in bitcoins
	and will be payable in bitcoins at the Sponsors sole discretion, which is expected to occur monthly in arrears. As consideration for its receipt of the Combined Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the trust agreement to assume and pay the
	following fees and expenses of the Trust: marketing fees, custodian fees, administrator fees and sponsor fees (the Constituent Fees), the shareholder communications hub fee, transfer agent fee, trustee fee, expenses related to public
	trading on OTCQX in an amount up to $600,000 annually (including legal and audit fees and expenses), any other legal and accounting fees, regulatory fees, printing and mailing costs, and applicable license fees (along with the Constituent Fees, the
	Assumed Fees). Subject to adoption of an updated Trust agreement, upon effectiveness of the registration statement on Form

	S-1,

	the Trust anticipates eliminating or increasing the current $600,000
	limit for expenses related to public trading that will be assumed by the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust as part of the assumed fees, among other modifications of defined terms.

	The Trust may pay expenses in addition to the Combined Fee and the Assumed Fees, such as, but not limited
	to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders, indemnification expenses, fees and expenses
	related to public trading on OTCQX in excess of $600,000 annually, and legal fees and expenses (collectively, Extraordinary Fees). As of March 31, 2017, no Extraordinary Fees have been incurred by the Trust since its inception.
	Management Fees on the Statement of Operations include the Combined Fee and would include the Extraordinary Fees to the extent they were incurred.


	For
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, the Trust incurred Management Fees of $891,281 and $292,325, respectively, which were paid in bitcoins. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 there were no accrued or
	unpaid management fees.



	7. Risks and Uncertainties



	The Trust is subject to various risks including market risk, liquidity risk, and other risks related to its concentration in a single asset, bitcoin. Investing
	in bitcoin is currently unregulated, highly speculative, and volatile.


	The net asset value of the Trust relates directly to the value of the bitcoins
	held by the Trust, and fluctuations in the price of bitcoins could materially and adversely affect an investment in the shares of the Trust. The price of bitcoins has a limited history. During such history, bitcoin prices have been volatile and
	subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity. If bitcoin markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations, the Trust may experience losses. Several factors may affect the price of bitcoins, including, but not
	limited to, global bitcoin supply and demand, and competition from other forms of digital currency or payments services.


	The bitcoins held by the Trust
	are commingled and the Trusts shareholders have no specific rights to any specific bitcoins. In the event of the insolvency of the Trust, its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by its shareholders.


	There is currently no clearing house for bitcoins, nor is there a central or major depository for the custody of bitcoins. There is a risk that some or all of
	the Trusts bitcoins could be lost or stolen. The Trust does not have insurance protection on its bitcoins which exposes the Trust and its shareholders to the risk of loss of the Trusts bitcoins. Further, bitcoin transactions are
	irrevocable. Stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Trust. DCG Holdco no longer servers as a custodian of the Trust in
	any capacity. The Sponsors parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Xapo that represents less than 1% of Xapos ownership.


	To the extent private keys for bitcoin addresses are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private keys are accessible, the Trust may
	be unable to access the bitcoin held in the associated address and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the bitcoin network.


	The
	processes by which bitcoin transactions are settled are dependent on the bitcoin


	peer-to-peer


	network, and as such, the Trust is subject to operational risk. A risk also
	exists with respect to previously unknown technical vulnerabilities, which may adversely affect the value of bitcoin.


	As of the close of business on
	April 28, 2017 the fair value of bitcoin determined in accordance with the Trusts accounting policy was $1,318.98 per bitcoin.

	Total return is calculated assuming an initial investment made at the net asset value at the beginning of the period and redemption on the last day of the
	period.



	9. Indemnifications



	In the normal course of
	business, the Trust enters into certain contracts that provide a variety of indemnities, including contracts with the Sponsor and affiliates of the Sponsor, DCG Holdco and its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates, and Xapo as
	well as others relating to services provided to the Trust.


	The Trusts maximum exposure under these and its other indemnities is unknown. However,
	no liabilities have arisen under these indemnities in the past and, while there can be no assurances in this regard, there is no expectation that any will occur in the future. Therefore, the Sponsor does not consider it necessary to record a
	liability in this regard.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	To the Sponsor of


	Bitcoin Investment Trust


	We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investment, of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (the
	Trust) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations and change in net assets for each of the years in the

	two-year

	period ended December 31, 2016. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Trusts Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Trusts internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provided a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations for each of the years in the

	two-year

	period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America.


	In forming our opinion we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures included in Note 7 to the financial statements
	concerning among other things the risks and uncertainties related to the Trusts investment in bitcoin. The risks and rewards to be recognized by the Trust associated with its investment in bitcoin will be dependent on many factors outside of
	the Trusts control. The currently unregulated and immature nature of the bitcoin market including clearing, settlement, custody and trading mechanisms, the dependency on information technology to sustain bitcoin continuity, as well as
	valuation and volume volatility all subject bitcoin to unique risks of theft, loss, or other misappropriation. Furthermore, these factors also contribute to the significant uncertainty with respect to the future viability and value of bitcoin. Our
	opinion is not qualified in respect to this matter.

	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	1.
	Organization



	The Bitcoin Investment Trust (the Trust), a Delaware Trust that commenced operations on September 25, 2013, is an
	investment trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin. The Trust holds bitcoins and, from time to time, issues shares (Shares) (in minimum denominations of 100, referred to as Baskets) in exchange for deposits of bitcoins
	and distributes bitcoins in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Shares of the Trust represent common units of fractional undivided beneficial interests in the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the
	performance of the market price of bitcoins, less the Trusts expenses.


	Grayscale Investments LLC (Grayscale or the Sponsor)
	acts as the sponsor of the Trust and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc. (DCG). The Sponsor monitors the overall performance of the Trust. Grayscale is responsible for preparing and providing quarterly and annual
	reports on behalf of the Trust to investors. Grayscale is also responsible for selecting and monitoring the Trusts service providers. As payment for its services, Grayscale charges the Trust fees as discussed in Note 6.


	Authorized Participants of the Trust are the only entities that may place orders to create or redeem Baskets. Genesis Global Trading, Inc.
	(Genesis or the Authorized Participant), a registered broker dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, serves as the Trusts sole Authorized Participant and is party to a participant agreement with the Sponsor and the
	Trust. The participant agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of bitcoins required for creation or redemption. Refer to Note 11 for a subsequent pending change of Authorized
	Participants.


	The custodian of the Trust (the Custodian) is responsible for safeguarding the bitcoins held by the Trust. The Custodian
	through August 8, 2015 was DCG Holdco, Inc. (DCG Holdco). On August 9, 2015, Xapo, Inc. (Xapo) became the Custodian.


	The transfer agent for the Trust is Continental Stock Transfer Corporation. The responsibilities of the transfer agent are to maintain creations, redemptions,
	and transfers of the Trusts shares in book form.


	On March 25, 2015, the Trust received notice that its shares had been qualified for trading
	on the OTCQX U.S. Premier Marketplace of the OTC Markets Group Inc. (OTCQX). The Trusts trading symbol on OTCQX is GBTC and the CUSIP number for its shares is 09173T108.



	2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	The
	following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust:


	The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
	generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
	Codification Topic 946. The Trust is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
	results could differ from those estimates.


	The Trust conducts its transactions in bitcoins, including receiving bitcoins for the creation of Shares,
	payment of bitcoins for the redemption of Shares, and payment of fees in bitcoins. Since its inception, the Trust has not held cash or cash equivalents.


	The Trust classifies its investment in bitcoins as a commodity, which is consistent with the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions indication that
	bitcoins are considered commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.




	Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition




	The Trust considers its investment transactions to be the receipt of bitcoins for Share creations and the delivery of bitcoins for Share redemptions or as
	payment of expenses. The Trust records its investment transactions on


	 


	F-18

	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using an average cost
	method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for fees in bitcoins and Share redemptions.




	Fair Value Measurement




	Fair value
	is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.


	U.S. GAAP utilizes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
	unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the
	Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trusts assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is
	categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 1  Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are
	readily and regularly available in an active market, these valuations do not entail a significant degree of judgment.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 2  Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 3  Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.




	The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary by investment. To the extent that valuations are based on sources that are less
	observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Fair value estimates do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized by the Trust.

	3. Fair Value of Bitcoin



	Bitcoins are held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust and is carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015 the Trust held
	172,094.67544221 and 141,101.20906271 bitcoins, respectively. The Trust determined the fair value per bitcoin to be $966.02 on December 31, 2016, and $431.88 on December 31, 2015 using the price provided at 4:00 PM in New York by the
	bitcoin market considered to be the Trusts


	 


	F-19

	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	principal market for bitcoins. To determine which exchange is the Trusts principal market for purposes of calculating the Trusts NAV, the Trust considers only bitcoin markets that are
	U.S. Dollar-denominated, have an online platform and publish transaction price and volume data publicly. Based on these requirements, the Trust prepares a list of eligible bitcoin markets and considers the following criteria to select its
	principal market: (i) the volume of bitcoins traded on a bitcoin market in the prior twelve months, (ii) a bitcoin markets regulatory compliance with applicable federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding
	anti-money laundering procedures and (iii) the degree of intra-day price fluctuations a bitcoin market experiences, as well as the degree of variance in prices across bitcoin exchanges.


	In determining which of the eligible bitcoin market is the Trusts principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order:


	First, the Trust sorts the list of eligible bitcoin markets from high to low by volume of bitcoin traded on each bitcoin market in the prior twelve months.
	The Trust moves down the list until it reaches a bitcoin market that has a volume of bitcoins traded for the prior twelve months that is less than 10% of the next largest bitcoin market and excludes this and all smaller bitcoin exchanges from the
	list. However, the list will always contain a minimum of three bitcoin markets, even if the percentage of volume drops to less than 10% of the next largest bitcoin market.


	Second, the Trust reviews the remaining bitcoin market and excludes any bitcoin markets that do not comply with the federal and state licensing requirements
	that are applicable to the Trust and the Authorized Participant(s). The Trust or an Authorized Participant can do business only with those bitcoin markets that meet the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the Trust or an Authorized
	Participant is registered to do business. The Trust also assesses each bitcoin markets practices regarding anti-money laundering procedures.


	Third,
	the Trust then reviews intra-day pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on bitcoin markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular bitcoin market. The Trust then
	selects a bitcoin market as its principal market based on highest trade volume and price stability in comparison to the other bitcoin markets on the list.


	The Trust determines its principal market annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine if (i) there have been recent changes to each bitcoin
	markets transaction volume in the prior twelve months, (ii) if any bitcoin market have fallen out of, or come into, compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, (iii) if the Trust has engaged any new Authorized Participant
	that, due to being registered to do business in another jurisdiction, would make bitcoin markets previously inaccessible to the Trust now accessible or (iv) if recent changes to each bitcoin marketss price stability have occurred that
	would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trusts determination of its principal market.


	Historically, the Trust considered Bitstamp to be its principal market with an exception for the period of January 5, 2015 through January 31, 2015
	when the Trust relied on pricing from Bitfinex. On January 5, 2015 Bitstamp suffered a disruption of operations, and in accordance with the Trusts procedures for determining its principal market, the Trust relied upon Bitfinex until
	January 31, 2015 when the Trust determined that Bitstamp was again able to be relied upon as the principal market. The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at December 31, 2016, and identified a change in the principal
	market from Bitstamp to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX) (formerly known as Coinbase Exchange). The Trust has applied this change in principal market effective December 31, 2016 and has valued bitcoins held by the Trust at
	December 31, 2016 using the GDAX exchange.

	4. Creations and Redemptions of Shares



	At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was an unlimited number of Shares authorized by the Trust. The Trust creates and redeems Shares
	from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets are made by the Authorized Participant in exchange for the delivery of bitcoins to the Trust or the distribution of bitcoins by the Trust. The number of
	bitcoins required for each creation basket or redemption basket is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the Trust at such time, by the number of Shares outstanding at such time and multiplying the quotient obtained by 100. Each
	Share represented approximately 0.094 and 0.096 of a bitcoin at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	The cost basis of investments in bitcoin
	recorded by the Trust is the fair value of bitcoin, as determined by the Trust, at 4:00 PM New York time on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by
	the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating and redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or bitcoins.


	Effective October 28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which Shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares
	through the Authorized Participant out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act, resulting in a settlement reached with the Securities Exchange Commission. The Trust is seeking an
	exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Regulation M in order to reinstate its redemption program, but the Distributor/Authorized Participant and the Trust cannot at this time predict the timeline of receiving
	an exemption or whether the Trust will be permitted to reinstate the Share redemption program for the benefit of Shareholders.


	On July 11, 2016, the
	Trust entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC pursuant to which it agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M, resulting in a negligible fee disgorgement by the Authorized Participant
	with no financial impact to the Trust. However, such settlement did not enable the Trust to reinstate the Share redemption program.


	On January 19,
	2017, in connection with and prior to the initial filing of the Form S-1 with the SEC, the Trust stopped issuing shares under the creation program, which had been taking place through private placement transactions.



	5. Income Taxes



	The Trust is intended to be treated as a
	grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, if the Trust is so treated, the Shareholders will be treated as owning proportionate interests in the Trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that case, the Trust, therefore, would not
	be subject to U.S. federal income tax.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	Instead, each Shareholder would be deemed to acquire and hold a proportionate interest in the Trusts
	assets and will be required to report its proportionate share of the Trusts gains, income, losses and expenses on its U.S. federal income tax returns in accordance with the Shareholders method of accounting. However, there can be no
	assurance that the IRS will agree with this conclusion and it is possible that the IRS could assert a position to the contrary to one or all of those conclusions and that a court could sustain that contrary conclusion.


	As of January 1, 2016, an amendment to the Trust Agreement was made regarding certain tax provisions. On February 9, 2017, the Court of Chancery of
	the State of Delaware ordered that the Original Trust Agreement be reformed so that the amendments made would be retroactive to the original date of execution of the agreement. The Trust is seeking a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding
	certainty for its tax position and is unable to predict a timeline of when a ruling will occur or whether a favorable outcome will be received. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require
	financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.



	6. Related Parties



	The Trust considers the following
	entities and their directors to be related parties of the Trust:   DCG, DCG Holdco, Genesis and Grayscale. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 217,512 and 191,741 shares were held by related parties of the Trust,
	respectively.


	In accordance with the Trust agreement, the Trust pays a Management Fee to the Sponsor, calculated as 2% of the aggregate value of the
	Trusts assets, less its liabilities (which include accrued but unpaid expenses), as calculated by the Sponsor or its delegates (the Combined Fee). The Combined Fee accrues daily in bitcoins and will be payable in bitcoins at the
	Sponsors sole discretion, which is expected to occur monthly in arrears. As consideration for its receipt of the Combined Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay the following fees and expenses of the Trust:
	  marketing fees, custodian fees, administrator fees and sponsor fees (the Constituent Fees), the shareholder communications hub fee, transfer agent fee, trustee fee, expenses related to public trading on OTCQX in an amount up
	to $600,000 annually (including legal and audit fees and expenses), any other legal and accounting fees, regulatory fees, printing and mailing costs, and applicable license fees (along with the Constituent Fees, the Assumed Fees). Refer
	to Note 11 for a subsequent pending change to the $600,000 assumed fees limit for expenses related to public trading.


	The Trust may pay expenses in
	addition to the Combined Fee and the Assumed Fees, such as, but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust
	or the interests of Shareholders, indemnification expenses, fees and expenses related to public trading on OTCQX in excess of $600,000 annually, and legal fees and expenses (collectively, Extraordinary Fees).


	As of December 31, 2016, no Extraordinary Fees have been incurred by the Trust since its inception.


	Management fees on the Statement of Operations include the Combined Fee and would include the Extraordinary Fees to the extent they were incurred.


	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Trust incurred management fees of $1,818,656 and $741,575, respectively, which were
	paid in bitcoins. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 there were no accrued and unpaid management fees, respectively.



	7. Risks and
	Uncertainties



	The Trust is subject to various risks including market risk, liquidity risk, and other risks related to its concentration in a single
	asset, bitcoins.   Investing in bitcoins is currently unregulated, highly speculative, and volatile.


	 


	F-22

	BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST




	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)



	 


	The net asset value of the Trust relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the Trust, and
	fluctuations in the price of bitcoins could materially and adversely affect an investment in the Shares of the Trust. The price of bitcoins has a limited history. During such history, bitcoin prices have been volatile and subject to influence by
	many factors including the levels of liquidity. If bitcoin markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations, the Trust may experience losses. Several factors may affect the price of bitcoins, including, but not limited to, global
	bitcoin supply and demand, theft of bitcoins from global exchanges or vaults, and competition from other forms of digital currency or payments services.


	The bitcoins held by the Trust are commingled and the Trusts Shareholders have no specific rights to any specific bitcoins. In the event of the
	insolvency of the Trust, its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by its shareholders.


	There is currently no clearing house for bitcoins, nor is
	there a central or major depository for the custody of bitcoins. There is a risk that some or all of the Trusts bitcoins could be lost or stolen. The Trust does not have insurance protection on its bitcoins which exposes the Trust and its
	Shareholders to the risk of loss of the Trusts bitcoins. Further, bitcoin transactions are irrevocable. Stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely
	affect an investment in the Trust. As of August 9, 2015, the Trust and Sponsor have transitioned the role of the Custodian to Xapo to fulfill all custodial obligations of the Trust, which were formerly the responsibility of DCG Holdco. DCG
	Holdco no longer serves as a custodian of the Trust in any capacity. The Sponsors parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Xapo that represents less than 1% of Xapos ownership.


	To the extent private keys for bitcoin addresses are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private keys are accessible, the Trust may
	be unable to access the bitcoins held in the associated address and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the bitcoin network. The processes by which bitcoin transactions are settled are dependent on the bitcoin peer-to-peer
	network, and as such, the Trust is subject to operational risk. A risk also exists with respect to previously unknown technical vulnerabilities, which may adversely affect the value of bitcoin.


	As of the close of business on February 24, 2017 the fair value of bitcoin determined in accordance with the Trusts accounting policy was $1,170.01
	per bitcoin.

	Ratios of net investment loss and expenses to average net assets have been annualized.


	An individual shareholders return, ratios, and per share performance may vary from those presented above based on the timing of share transactions.


	Total return is calculated assuming an initial investment made at the net asset value at the beginning of the period and redemption on the last day of the
	period.



	9. Indemnifications



	In the normal course of
	its operations, the Trust enters into certain contracts that provide a variety of indemnities, including contracts with the Sponsor and affiliates of the Sponsor, DCG Holdco and its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates, and
	Xapo beginning August 9, 2015 (see Footnote 7 regarding the change in Custodian), as well as others relating to services provided to the Trust.


	The
	Trusts maximum exposure under these and its other indemnities is unknown. However, no liabilities have arisen under these indemnities in the past and, while there can be no assurances in this regard, there is no expectation that any will occur
	in the future. Therefore, the Sponsor does not consider it necessary to record a liability in this regard.



	10. Subsequent Events



	On January 19, 2017, in connection with and prior to the initial filing of the Form S-1 with the SEC, the Trust stopped issuing Shares under the creation
	program, which had been taking place through private placement transactions.



	11. Subsequent Events (unaudited)



	The Trust has engaged KCG Americas LLC and Wedbush Securities to act as Authorized Participants upon effectiveness of the registration statement. Additional
	Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the discretion of the Sponsor. Upon effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1, Genesis will cease to act as Authorized Participant. Genesis will become a liquidity provider
	facilitating the purchase and sale of bitcoins on behalf of Authorized Participants. The trust has engaged Bank of New York Mellon to act as transfer agent and administrator to the trust upon effectiveness of the registration statement.


	Subject to adoption of an updated Trust agreement, upon effectiveness of the registration statement, the Trust anticipates eliminating or increasing the
	current $600,000 limit for expenses related to public trading that will be assumed by the sponsor on behalf of the trust as part of the assumed fees, among other modifications of defined terms.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS




	 







	Item 13.




	Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution.





	The Registrant (Registrant or
	Trust) shall not bear any expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered. These expenses shall be paid by Grayscale Investments, LLC, the sponsor of the Registrant
	(Sponsor).



	 







	Item 14.




	Indemnification of Directors and Officers.





	Section 2.4(a) of the Trust Agreement
	(Trust Agreement) between Delaware Trust Company, the Registrants Trustee (Trustee), and the Sponsor provides that the Trustee and any of the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Trustee (the
	Indemnified Persons) shall be indemnified by the Trust as primary obligor and held harmless against any loss, damage, liability, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, disbursement (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel),
	tax or penalty of any kind and nature whatsoever (collectively, Expenses), arising out of, imposed upon or asserted at any time against such Indemnified Person in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Trust
	Agreement, the creation, operation or termination of the Trust or the transactions contemplated therein; provided, however, that neither the Trust nor DCG HoldCo shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Person for any Expenses which are a
	result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Indemnified Person. If the Trust shall have insufficient assets or improperly refuses to pay an Indemnified Person within 60 days of a request for payment owed under
	Section 2.4 of the Trust Agreement, DCG HoldCo shall, as secondary obligor, compensate or reimburse the Trustee or indemnify, defend and hold harmless an Indemnified Person as if it were the primary obligor under Section 2.4 of the Trust
	Agreement. Any amount payable to an Indemnified Person under Section 2.4 of the Trust Agreement may be payable in advance and shall be secured by a lien on the Trust property. The obligations of DCG HoldCo and the Trust to indemnify the
	Indemnified Persons under this Section 2.4 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement.


	Section 4.7 of the Trust
	Agreement provides that the Sponsor, its affiliates and their respective members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (each a Sponsor Indemnified Party) shall be indemnified by the Trust against any
	loss, judgment, liability, expense and amount paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities for the Trust, provided that (i) the Sponsor Indemnified Party was acting on behalf of or performing services for
	the Trust and has determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust and such liability or loss was not the result of fraud, gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, or a material breach of this
	Trust Agreement on the part of the Sponsor Indemnified Party and (ii) any such indemnification will only be recoverable from the bitcoins and proceeds from the sale of bitcoins on deposit in the Trusts accounts as well as any rights of
	the Trust pursuant to any other agreements to which the Trust is a party.


	All rights to indemnification permitted in Section 4.7 of
	the Trust Agreement and payment of associated expenses shall not be affected by the dissolution or other cessation to exist of the Sponsor Indemnified Party, or the withdrawal, adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Sponsor Indemnified
	Party, or the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by or against the Sponsor Indemnified Party.


	Notwithstanding the other provisions of Section 4.7 of the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor Indemnified Party and any person acting as
	broker-dealer for the Trust shall not be indemnified for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of U.S. federal or state securities laws unless (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the
	merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs), (ii) such claims have been dismissed
	with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses


	 


	II-1







	Table of Contents



	(including, without limitation, litigation costs) or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against a particular indemnitee and finds that
	indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made. The Trust shall not incur the cost of that portion of any insurance which insures any party against any liability, the indemnification of which is prohibited by the Trust Agreement.
	Expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending civil, administrative or criminal action suit or proceeding against the Sponsor Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
	proceeding, if (i) the legal action relates to the performance of duties or services by the Sponsor Indemnified Party on behalf of the Trust; (ii) the legal action is initiated by a third party who is not a shareholder of the Trust or the
	legal action is initiated by a shareholder of the Trust and a court of competent jurisdiction specifically approves such advance; and (iii) the Sponsor Indemnified Party undertakes to repay the advanced funds with interest to the Trust in cases
	in which it is not entitled to indemnification under Section 4.7 of the Trust Agreement. In the event the Trust is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense as a
	result of or in connection with any shareholder of the Trusts (or assignees) obligations or liabilities unrelated to Trust business, such shareholder of the Trust (or assignees cumulatively) shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless, and
	reimburse the Trust for all such loss, liability, damage, cost and expense incurred, including attorneys and accountants fees.



	 







	Item 15.




	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.





	As of May 4, 2017, the Registrant has
	distributed 1,868,700 shares representing units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust at varying prices determined by reference to the price of bitcoins represented by each share to selected accredited
	investors, within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Genesis acted as the initial purchaser and Authorized Participant with respect to these distributors. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with
	respect to such sales.

	Undertakings.





	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


	(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:


	(i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the
	most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of
	securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with
	the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective
	registration statement; and


	(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not
	previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.


	(2) That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at
	that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective
	amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	(4) That, for the purpose of
	determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	(i) If the Registrant is relying on Rule 430B
	(§ 230.430B of this chapter):


	(A) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) (§
	230.424(b)(3) of this chapter) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and


	(B) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) (§ 230.424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7)
	of this chapter) as part of a registration statement in reliance or Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) (§ 230.415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) of this chapter) for the purpose of providing
	the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of an included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of
	the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability proposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter such date shall be deemed to be a new effective
	date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided,
	however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of
	the registration statement will, as to a purchase with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement
	or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or


	 


	II-3







	Table of Contents



	(ii) If the Registrant is subject to Rule 430C (§ 230.430C of this chapter),
	each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A (§ 230.430A of this
	chapter), shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the
	registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to
	such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.


	(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
	distribution of the securities:


	The undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned
	Registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the
	undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed
	pursuant to Rule 424 (§ 230.424 of this chapter);


	(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared
	by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;


	(iii) The portion of
	any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and


	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.


	(6) That insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
	controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
	Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of
	the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
	matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final
	adjudication of such issue.

Apple’s stagnant product lines mostly reflect the state of the computer industry

Most of Apple’s product lines are severely overdue for a refresh. Apart from the recently refreshed MacBook, many of the company’s Mac products are well over a year old. The Mac Mini is nearly two, the high-end workstation Mac Pro is almost three, and the sole remaining non-Retina MacBook Pro is now more than four years old.Writing for The Verge, Sam Byford recently argued that “Apple should stop selling four year-old computers.” He’s not wrong to note the 2012-era MacBook Pro is pretty long in the tooth with its 4GB of RAM and Ivy Bridge-based processor, or that Apple has neglected specific products, like the Mac Mini. I thought about writing a similar article last month, but with a specific focus on the Mac Pro. After digging around in Intel’s Ark (a tool that lets you compare the specifics of various Intel processors), I realized that while there are exceptions, Apple’s relatively lax refresh cycle is mostly driven by the low rate of improvements in PC hardware these days. Apple is just more honest about it.
Meet the new CPU, same as the old CPUSetting aside the non-Retina MacBook Pro from 2012, most of Apple’s laptops are running on Broadwell or Skylake (the 2016 MacBook). There’s a single SKU left over from Haswell at the $1,999 price point, but the laptop lineup is pretty new.Byford is right when he calls out the nearly three-year gap between the Mac Pro’s debut and the present day, but he doesn’t specifically discuss just how little this has meant to the machine’s top end performance. The Mac Pro ships in two configurations we’ll address: An Ivy Bridge Xeon quad-core at 3.7GHz with 10MB L3 (E5-1620 v2) or a 2.7GHz 12-core IVB-EP CPU with 30MB L3 (E5-2697 v2). Let’s compare those with their counterparts today.In the chart above, we’ve arranged each IVB chip on the left, followed by its modern counterpart. Intel doesn’t have a 12-core Broadwell chip in the 135W TDP bracket, only in 105W and 160W flavors. There are higher-core count systems with lower clock speeds, but our hypothetical test-case is a user who wants both high clocks and high core counts.The first thing to note is how little Intel’s chip lineup has actually changed in the past three years. The modern E5-2687 v4 has a slightly higher base clock speed but a significantly higher TDP. Top frequency is identical between the two. Broadwell offers essentially no clock speed improvements over IVB-E at the quad-core level — in fact, the IVB-EP actually clocked higher than its counterpart. True, architectural improvements will compensate for some of this, but not by much — Haswell was roughly 8% faster than IVB-E, and Skylake hasn’t come to the E5 family yet. You’d get some uplift if your application supports and makes significant use of AVX2, but otherwise? There’s not a lot of upgrade to be had.In short, there’s just not much reason to update the Mac Pro’s CPU — not until and unless Intel can field designs that truly merit it. While Apple will likely eventually refresh the Mac Pro, the only big winners will be Mac users who want to pack as many threads as possible into a single-socket system (Intel now offers Xeons with up to 22 cores in the E5 family).What about GPUs?GPUs are where the lengthy wait times in between refresh cycles really does bite customers. The current top-end Mac Pro fields a pair of D700 graphics cards based on AMD’s original GCN 1.0 architecture. AMD has built multiple cards that could’ve been used to upgrade these configurations, while the Polaris GPU inside the RX 480 would deliver better performance and more VRAM at a much lower TDP and price point.The problem with criticizing Apple’s GPU performance is that Apple doesn’t care all that much about graphics, period. OS X continues to field a version of OpenGL that’s nearly six years old and Apple isn’t supporting Vulkan, instead choosing to field its own close-to-metal API, Metal. Apple isn’t exactly out of step with the rest of the industry; outside of boutique laptops, there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete GPUs any more — at least, not many below the $1,000 price point, and not with decent graphics hardware. If your workloads depend on GPUs and scale with graphics horsepower, you aren’t using Apple. (There are plenty of workloads that run better on GPUs than CPUs, but don’t actually scale all that well, which is why I make that distinction).For a brief moment in 2013, with the launch of the Mac Pro, it looked like Apple might embrace OpenCL, GPGPU programming and offload, and put a new focus on integrating high-end GPUs into its various products. That moment has come and gone. While I do suspect we’ll see Apple hardware with refreshed graphics hardware, it’ll be the 14nm refresh cycle that drives it, not any particular interest in GPU computing or graphics as a whole.
So… where’s that leave us?I’m not an Apple apologist. I use an iPhone, granted, but I’m still back on the 5c and I plan to use it until the screen cracks or the battery dies. Posts like this inevitably ignite arguments over whether Apple devices are worth paying for, and whether a different manufacturer offers more value at a given price point. Spoiler alert: Oftentimes, they do, though you may have to do an infuriating amount of searching before finding a system you actually like.It’s been a while since Apple updated its hardware, some of that hardware could be better than it is, and the net result would be systems that were at least a little sexier than they are today. But Apple has kept updating most of its laptop lines to take advantage of better battery life and performance improvements, while the performance of desktop CPUs has largely stagnated. Is it ignoring GPUs? Yes — but that’s completely par for Apple. The Mac Pro in 2013 was unusual precisely because it put GPU compute first and foremost. Apple’s decision to mostly ignore the segment afterwards might be unfortunate, but it’s scarcely surprising.Apple has held off on making fundamental platform changes precisely because it’s been waiting for the underlying technology to advance enough to make the changes worthwhile. Given the frustration of sorting through hundreds of nearly identical laptops from multiple manufacturers every time a friend or family member asks for help choosing a laptop, I’m not sure I can blame them.

The running vm



A 12 core xeon is enough to last 5 to 6 years in operation, or even longer.
Such are the meaningful changes of intel Cpus.
Why fix something that isn’t broken?






ta2025



Because Apple is all about “image” and their image is getting tarnished by not releasing new and innovative designs.   Leaving old computer in their product lineup is like watching grapes wither on the vine.






The running vm



You mist my point by a long shot.
Why would I upgrade a computer with a 12 core xeon and 64gb of ram when it still works perfectly well for my needs?






http://www.flickr.com/photos/catchphotography/                H23



?????It may work today. but for the person in 16 it will be very outdated by 18 let alone 2022. This only makes sense for the people in 13 and 14 to get miles to 17 or 18. Thus the other OEM’s and hardware makers refreshing products with advancement. 
Also productivity gets a massive boost in new hardware, more than you think, so why buy older hardware for poorer productivity when the purpose of buying highend hardware is usually productivity.






trparky



Here’s the problem with your thinking. In most situations you’re not going to see much of a performance boost when upgrading from an older CPU to a newer CPU, at least not like we saw years ago. Years ago we saw performance boosts in leaps and bounds but today we barely see a 5% increase in performance when upgrading our CPUs.
There is one piece of hardware where if you do replace it you will see a HUGE performance boost and that is the hard drive. Replace your boot device with an SSD and all of a sudden even an older machine will feel like new again.
We’ve come to the point where CPUs are far more powerful than most people need however our biggest performance bottleneck is disk I/O latency and bandwidth. If you can’t get the data to the CPU, it doesn’t matter how fast your CPU is, your system is going to be slow.






Bluetooth



That’s a good point and Apple has really been at the forefront in using the new NVMExpress standard for fast SSD data transfer.






The running vm



Most m.2 SSds are fast enough nowadays.






Merckel



Good advice to upgrade to SSD.  I’m rocking a 17″ MBP with a new SSD and the machine still functions very well (albeit with an older panel, not retina).






Sam Kennedy



It depends on the task and what your talking about. Floating point performance usually see’s a greater increase as well as various other areas such as battery life and TDP, I upgraded a 4 year old cpu and it was close to a 30% increase it was the same model just 4 years newer (6700k). Regardless of whether its 5% a cycle baseline or higher I would not find it acceptable to spend 1500 dollars on a laptop with a 3 year old cpu in it. Thats just apple being lazy or cheap and nothing more if they want to be lazy and not update the design thats fine but at least release computers with new CPU’s when those CPU’s come out, other smaller and less successful Manufacturers manage to do it every cycle apple doesnt have an excuse.






Joel Hruska



” I would not find it acceptable to spend 1500 dollars on a laptop with a 3 year old cpu in it.” 
There are two laptops where this is the case:  The $1999 Haswell and the old Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro (non-Retina). That system will probably get killed off in the near future. 
Most of Apple’s laptops use Broadwell or Skylake.






http://www.flickr.com/photos/catchphotography/                H23



Why would you assume that we all didn’t know that, The performance and efficiency gains on CPU is still apparent in benchmarks, the system also would benefit greatly from graphics upgrades, memory upgrades and hard drove upgrade. The entire system needs to be yupgraded.










Merckel



Meanwhile, the PC copycats keep following Apple’s design.  As the article above stated, there aren’t compelling reasons for Apple to upgrade with marginally improved chips.






Sam Kennedy



Other manufacturers that are much less successful than apple manage to do it every cycle I dont see what apple’s excuse is aside from Greed or laziness. They dont need to update the design , just ship with new CPU’s when they are available.










Martian Monkey



Agreed. I’m running a Mac Pro 1,1 (2006!) Everything still runs pretty smooth on it. 
But just to keep it current, I’m going to upgrade the video card to an AMD 7950. Amazing that it can run something like that. Soon I’ll be able to put in newer CPUs and it’ll spec very close to newer machines. I’ll quite possibly get another 10 years out of it. 
It’s simply one of the best computers I’ve ever owned.






Sam Kennedy



Well if someone wanted to buy the current mac pro they could get a computer 3x better for about 1/5 of the price or buy 5 computers over that 10 year life cycle for the same price. Also apple’s all in ones are very upgradeable (you can watch a linus tech tips video on it) meaning that unless your willing to deal with the option detailed above (1 computer for the price of 5 better computers) no one will be in your situation any time soon.






Martian Monkey



I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy the current Mac Pro. I agree about the all in one’s upgradability there’s a healthy aftermarket in that regard. 
However, I disagree about ‘my situation’. I’ve been involved with computers since the 80s and if one thing has become abundantly clear is that cheaper tech is not the same. I’m willing to pay for Apple’s premium because the parts are better and they work together with a minimum of fuss. 
I’d rather drop $400 on parts to upgrade my Mac Pro than on some noname PC that will start acting crazy in two years. (I work on an Acer PC at my day job, so I’m not whistling Dixie here).  






uniquename72



“I’d rather drop $400 on parts to upgrade my Mac Pro than on some noname PC that will start acting crazy in two years.”
As someone who’s also been “involved with computers since the ’80s,” I built my own 6 years ago and haven’t had an issue since. Someday soon I’ll upgrade the graphics. It’ll take 15 minutes and cost nearly nothing.
I get why people buy off-the-shelf laptops. But why any slightly knowledgeable person would shell out for a name brand desktop — and then claim that the “parts are better and they work together with a minimum of fuss” — will forever be a mystery to me.






Martian Monkey



I’m really glad you haven’t had issues for 6 years. I mean it not sarcastically. But I’ve been burned so many times by PCs I don’t even go down that path anymore. Every. Time.
 I’ve troubleshot such inexplicable and weird issues, I can’t even begin to list them. Driver incompatibilities are well documented problems and I don’t want to deal with them anymore. (Ever try to troubleshoot a Cintiq? In Windows 9??)
Simplicity, viruses and exploitability are all concerns that aren’t something you have to deal with on a Mac, for the most part. Not saying they don’t exist but they aren’t daily concerns. 












http://www.flickr.com/photos/catchphotography/                H23



For the person that purchased it initially yes…2013 and 14…but not for the person purchasing the same hardware in the last 2 years….See the massive flaw in your logic?






The Shambolic Skeptic



It’s not about getting 5 years out of an investment – it’s about APPL keeping current so us paying top dollar are getting current part. GPUs included.








JE



There are some updates to the Intel chips that are not visible in ARK but that can be rather important.  The processor-per-clock improvements are rather impressive when added up over a few generations (say 5% per gen).  Also, Haswell made big improvement in how efficient the Hyperthreads are.  Not to mention improvements in VT-x performance.  And overall power consumption is making big strides in recent generations.  An Ivy Bridge laptop is a total disgrace today, all laptops sold should be Broadwell or newer really. The servers, especially for compute-intense parallel software and virtualized workloads benefit from newer Xeons.






Bluetooth



The main problem is that software which is designed to be backwards compatible will not use these new commands. But for servers then you can take advantage of the newest, but it doesn’t apply here.






trparky



Why should I even think about upgrading? I have a Windows desktop PC and it’s got an Ivy Bridge i5 CPU (3570k) in it, it does everything I need it to do and more. I’ve upgraded the video card twice in it. I’ll run this machine until it’s dead.






Joel Hruska



I’m not aware of any improvements Haswell made to Hyper-Threading performance in real-world scenarios. Haswell added execution units and boosted internal cache memory, which could indirectly improve HT performance, but HT scaling is still typically around 20%. 
Counting forward from Ivy Bridge, you’ve got the following progression: 
IVB – Haswell = Roughly 8%. 
Haswell – Broadwell = 1-2%. 
Broadwell – Skylake = 3-4%. 
But these gains have often come at the price of reduced core clocks as Intel tries to squeeze into smaller form factors. So while it’s absolutely true that newer chips offer better battery life, for example, the top-end performance is often only modestly improved. Power efficiency gains, not raw speed, is what drives most upgrades these days.






jeremyg85



Well that’s not fully correct, the jump from Haswell to Sky for mobile did massive wonders for the surface line in the 30% range.. http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph9727/78073.png
Why? Because thermals are so much better and heat is the real performance killer. Obviously a thinner, lighter, quieter, and most importantly faster MacBook Pro would be welcomed by all.






Joel Hruska



Sure. I was considering desktop perf not laptop, but yes — in systems where thermals are a significant limitation, any improvement to power consumption can be translated into significant perf gains.












Brandon Dang



Great article, with an astute and levelheaded discussion. 
Adds something to think about as I’m looking to buy a MacBook Pro and the blogosphere is swimming with “IT’S GONNA BE BIG because we’ve been waiting and that’s the only reason”. So, time will tell and this will be my most interesting wait!






MadeMac



Agree. The only reason I upgraded my 2009 iMac with 16GB ram and 2 TB hard drive to a new MBP was that the iMac died. No other reason. I do intensive excel work and lots of Indesign graphics. Speed on mew MBP is great due to the SSD. Don’t need a 2TB drive anymore now have switched to using cloud








http://www.funstufftosee.com/                dozerman



Maybe it is that the new hotness isn’t computers anymore. 






lord cheeseburger



The Mac line up is still great, it’s growing in sales every quarter and people don’t replace their computers very often anymore.  The only people who care are the 1% of technophile nerds who masturbate over the latest CPU.  The actual performance of a their lineup in the hands of 99% of the population is still wonderful, even 4 years later.






Daniel Revas



“The only people who care are the 1% of technophile nerds who masturbate over the latest CPU”? 
Gaming Computers are the only segment experiencing year-over-year growth. I doubt that it is only “1%”.






trparky



Games are more dependent upon GPUs than CPUs.






Daniel Revas



Yet more and more Games are listing Quad Core CPU’s as REQUIRED, and older Quad CPU’s, like the Athlon Phenom Series, don’t cut it.






trparky



Correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t most games still single-threaded CPU beasts?






Joel Hruska



No. Many games these days — at least popular AAA titles — are at least dual-threaded. Many are quad-threaded. It’s true that the scaling isn’t always very strong from two to four threads, but most titles pick up at least some benefit from additional cores. 
I’m not sure if there are any games that actually require a quad core. There are some titles that specify four *threads*, but Intel’s Core i3 dual-core with HT is usually sufficient for them.






Daniel Revas



Most yes, but games like BF4 scale beyond 4 Cores.














Bluetooth



Is this any better for other manufacturers? I think the main problem is Intel switching from Tick/Tock to process-architecture-optimization last March and thus, delaying all chips.






HumanSauce



The cheapest Chinese manufacturer is capable of doing incremental CPU/GPU updates.
I’m a Network Architect in a 5000+ user environment who has been the advocate that allowed Mac’s in our environment.
Apple lost me.  If they lost me, they are in trouble.  I was a fanboy.
I’m so pissed, I’m ditching my iPhone too.






The running vm



You are expecting a gpu upgrade, from apple of all people?






Merckel



Did you read the article?  Incremental updates are marginal ones.  Apple will VERY LIKELY be coming out with new MBP in Sept.  IF they had updated the processors to Skylake in June, those customers would have been PISSED it they bought on the eve of new designs this fall.  Is that so hard to understand?






jeremyg85



The rMBP line is well over a year old, updating in March or February would have been the right move, every other computer manufacture managed to do it with much lower sales.. getting 5-10% improvement at the same cost DOES make sense, how is that so hard to understand?










http://www.flickr.com/photos/catchphotography/                H23



14nm GPU’s intended for mobile (15-35 watts) will give GPU a boost in PC laptops and hopefully Mac. AMD’s SSG sounds perfect for a macpro.






Tony_IA



“The problem with criticizing Apple’s GPU performance is that Apple doesn’t care all that much about graphics” – So because Apple doesn’t care about graphics, the rest of the world should forget about it? That has to be the worst validation for a companies poor representation that i have ever heard. 
“there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete GPUs any more — at least, not many below the $1,000 price point” – I didn’t think Apple sold any Mac Pro as referenced for under $1,000, so does this comment even apply to Apple? 
I’m always amazed when comparing to Apple, writers chose the lowest end PC that costs sometimes a thousand dollars less and then say “look, it works the same as that computer” when they were never in the same league. If this article wanted to be non-biased, it would have compared a comparable priced new PC with an new Apple PC, and then said “how does the hardware compare within the same price range”? Sure, Apples tighter software integration would mitigate some of the hardware difference, but not nearly as much as this article tries to imply. My wife wants a faster mac…there is no option, she’s stuck with her slow and tired mac for now and the foreseeable future.






lord cheeseburger



The Mac Mini is like $600 and the low end Macbook Air is $899 last time I looked.






Tony_IA



True, my comment was poorly written. The paragraph above and below his statement references the Mac Pro, not the mini or air, so I’ve corrected my comment to reflect that. Of course, given how quickly you replied, maybe they do?








Joel Hruska



“”there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete GPUs any more — at least, not many below the $1,000 price point” – I didn’t think Apple sold any Mac Pro as referenced for under $1,000, so does this comment even apply to Apple?” 
Sorry, that was a mobile market statement. Apologies for it being unclear. 
Here’s what I’m saying: 
1).  Apple doesn’t care about graphics. 
2).  Apple has never cared about graphics. 
3).  If you buy Apple hardware, you probably don’t care about graphics performance, either *or* Apple’s limited performance is good enough for whatever you’re doing. 
If you continue to buy Apple hardware after being demonstrably shown that Apple continues to not-care about graphics, and your work or pleasure depends on high levels of graphics performance, well, that’s not very smart.






Alex Gollner



On the other hand, Apple’s move to GPU compute for iMovie and Final Cut Pro X has made them much better at dealing with compositing jobs that Adobe and Avid have problems with. 
The ProApps team care very much about GPU power. They may be only a $300m-400m business for Apple, but the wider organisation likes the idea of having high-end creative tools running on Macs and MacOS.
I think you are right that Apple are more honest than their competition, but HP seem to be spending millions on trying to attract high-end Mac users over to their kit.
Given that GPU power is at the heart of Final Cut, and as it is the perfect demo app for high end computers (even mainstream journalists understand what video editing is), I hope the MacPro and MacBook Pro has been waiting for the new GPU hotness that has been coming out this Summer. e.g. for MacBook Pro: Mobile version of NVIDIA GTX 970 (desktop card is $249) and for MacPro a custom version of NVIDIA GTX 1080 ($699). Apple have been known to switch GPU suppliers between generations of same model Mac.
PS: I’m only getting 4fps stitching a 6 GoPro video panorama in Kolor Autopano Video Pro on the 2013-era GPU in my MacBook, so I hope Apple do change things up in October.






Joel Hruska



Don’t mistake GPU acceleration for *scaling* well with higher-end GPUs. I observed this on numerous occasions when benchmarking workstation cards. You can get a kick moving from a CPU to a GPU, but adding higher-end GPUs rarely shows performance improvements at the rate one might expect. Typically you get a fairly static one-time jump with relatively minor improvements from higher-end cards. So the D500 on a Mac Pro might be 80% faster than using the CPU, but the D700 might only be 5-7% faster than the D500. 
Exactly how it all plays out will depend on workload, application, and tuning, of course.












BHesse



Apple REALLY needs to dump AMD and make at least one professional level computer with the latest Nvidia cards. I’ve been having to build my own Hackintosh builds to get decent performance for my neural networks in OS X these past few years, it’s absolutely ridiculous that Apple’s ‘best’ GPU is from 2013…






The running vm



Agreed, but AMD gives them cheeper prices.






Linuxcooldude



Apple is not too interested in Nvidia CUDA, as it locks in users to specific applications. With AMD a lot more is open source to utilize it without restrictions.








JD234



I’d be fine with a stagnant computer if they lowered the prices as the machines aged.  Keeping a 2012 MacBook Pro at roughly 2012 prices when the marginal price of components and construction has fallen is price gouging.  Sure, they can get away with it, and it may make sense for their bottom line.  But that doesn’t mean we have to like it, like them, or like Tim Cook for doing so.  They’d rather maintain premium brand appearance among those who don’t know any better, at the cost of appearing like jerks to those of us who do.  And all for the sake of profits they don’t even know what to do with.






grand_puba



I set a rule for myself regarding apple many years ago: never depend on apple products when it comes to my livelihood.
Through the decades, I have seen apple flip on its partners and customers SO MANY TIMES that I know better than to trust them. Apple products are for fun or for general use, not for work!

I have worked professionally with Mac’s for over 15 years in the Broadcast field, before that I used a Pc. To me it’s not about the hardware but the OS and OSX is just more solid and more reliable. When you need to meet an urgent deadline you can’t afford to mess about.








Tom Scharf



How can you possibly expect a company that only makes $50B in profit a year to spend the huuuuuuuge amount money it would take to upgrade their machines with new boards that Intel literally did all the hard work on?
This is absolutely unreasonable.






LostAlone



Apple definitely suffers the most from the slow down in development. They have focused their whole company around the image of innovation and now they can’t make good on that. PCs are cheaper and have copied all the interesting and different ideas like all in one systems and unibody aluminium laptops and now it’s a lot harder for Apple to stand out. They’re stuck using the same parts as everything else and dressing them up as more innovative some how and charging more too and that’s not a recipe for success. They are very much following now; the lacklustre iPad Pro being presented as a Surface-type tablet and doing so quite poorly is a great example.






don681



Truth is, unless you are gaming or producing media, the average 2 year old laptop or the average 4 year old desktop is more than capable of daily tasks.
We are almost at that point where computers will last the same age as a microwave or a fridge even, most people replace them when they break, not because they are outdated.






Mekhios



Still using my 2013 MacBook Air (fully loaded). Still works perfectly, is fast, and I see no reason to upgrade it.






Harrison Ford



While you’re not wrong that Apple doesn’t “care” about GPUs, it doesn’t excuse the fact that they don’t care about GPUs. 
It seems that CPUs have plateaued for now, but GPUs have not and a lot of the important developments in computing in the last years have been GPU bound. Such as VR. 
There’s no excuse for Apple ditching GPGPU and it’s incredibly myopic to look at computers as just a CPU with incidental GPUs hooked up to them. 
GPUs are what allowed smartphones and tablets to take over the market, the CPU of a phone is relatively pathetic, but the GPU is pretty amazing. 
And it’s not just the GPU, there’s RAM and a number of other things. There’s no excuse to be made for Apple, they just don’t have a vision any more. Calling that “honest” is far more charitable than they deserve.






Joel Hruska



Unfortunately, I can’t really call Apple out for pricing. RAM upgrades on hardware are almost always ridiculously expensive. With multiple manufacturers moving to soldered RAM for many systems, they charge just as much as Apple does for upgrades. 
What I’m calling honest is the fact that they *don’t* update hardware — as opposed to updating it, and then attempting to respin incredibly marginal improvements as huge leaps.






Daniel Glass



I think the biggest Sin in the current Mac Pro’s design is in completely ignoring the pre-existing user base that had been clamoring for an updated version of the big, broadly useful desktop for the line in favor of a super-compact unit that can’t be upgraded or take PCI/PCI-E cards without an expensive, bottlenecking Thunderbolt external enclosure.
But that’s par for the course for Apple and Pro users for the last decade or so, such as switching from PowerPC to Intel but giving software devs only about a year to completely re-write their code. Which wasn’t a big deal for some, but Adobe had done a lot of architecture-specific optimization on Creative Suite that dragged them to a crawl on Intel procs running OSX.






Joel Hruska



That’s a valid point, for sure. There were some customers who faced having to migrate their storage arrays to Thunderbolt external drives simply because Apple felt like removing drive bays. Don’t blame them for being upset. 
(Thunderbolt shouldn’t practically be a perf bottleneck on storage in the majority of cases, since most people don’t use vast RAID arrays that would saturate a PCIe 2.0 x4 connection — but I’m sure there were exceptions).






Daniel Glass



Not just storage though, there’s also task-specific cards that were built to run on the PCI-E bus that would be choked over thunderbolt.






Joel Hruska



Hrm. I can’t speak to that without knowing more. In consumer hardware, only GPUs and high-speed storage arrays can push enough data to really bottleneck the Thunderbolt bus. But there’s definitely a latency hit associated with Thunderbolt, mostly because the controller hangs off the southbridge as opposed to the CPU. GPU tests on T-bolt typically show a roughly 12% performance hit. 
But I can see how this could happen. If you had high-end video capture cards, for example, the PCIe 2.0 x4 link in Tbolt 2 wouldn’t be enough for high-speed video capture without bottlenecking.






Daniel Glass



There’s also the choice between having multiple enclosures so each gets a full T-bolt link or trying to make do with a 2-3 card box.














Croc



You could say the same thing for the mobile devices. And there is actually little need for iPhone 7 to exist with its small incremental changes.
Plus, hardware improvement is more than just CPU and GPU. The screen on that MBA is a disgrace.
Apple created the MB and MBA years ago not because it needed new enclosure for a fancy new CPU.
Winding the clock back 10 years, and if Apple had the same outdated product line, do you think it would have survived?






Frank_100



Apple really needs to allow the OS to run on non-apple hardware. It would provide much needed competition to the desktop that Linux doesn’t seem to provoke. There is nothing special or proprietary about a Mac- except the rom.






http://www.engadget.com/                Jon Fingas



No, it absolutely shouldn’t.  And that’s not because I’m trying to defend the status quo, it’s because you’re suggesting that Apple throw out the very thing that makes it successful.
Apple, at its heart, is a hardware company.  It’s not just that it gets its big profits from hardware sales; it’s that macOS thrives on tight integration between hardware and software.  It can support true 5K displays (as opposed to the grafted dual displays you see from PC vendors) because it custom-developed hardware to make that happen.  It was first with trackpad gestures because it custom-built the trackpads, the first to use Thunderbolt because it helped design the spec.  And so on.  The hardware is what lets its software shine.
If you let macOS run on third-party PCs, you end up in Microsoft’s boat. That means targeting the lowest common denominator of hardware, compiling catalogues of thousands of drivers… and having to attach your name to pieces of crap.  Do you really want macOS to be associated with the flimsy laptop you found at Best Buy with the dodgy trackpad, washed-out display and 4-hour battery life?  One of the reasons Microsoft started the Surface line was to fix Windows’ reputation for garbage hardware, to show vendors how a computer should be made.
Besides, Apple actually tried allowing Mac clones in the mid-1990s.  It nearly killed the company, and many credit Jobs’ decision to kill clones with contributing to Apple’s turnaround.  There’s no indication that Apple would fare any better if it made that choice in 2016, especially not when the overall PC market is on the decline.






Frank_100



Apple used to be a hardware company. Now it is a branding 
company with a pretty good user interface for FreeBSD. They could sell the OS for $250 a pop and still keep the profitability. The clone wars may or may not have hurt Apple. Many business will not buy equipment if there is only one supplier so Apple may have made inroads into industry that it wouldn’t without the clones. Apple was hurt by OS 8.5 and PowerPC being largely incompatible with OS 7 hardware or software. They did a dead drop of support for 7 years worth of customers. Not an infrequent event for Apple. Check the compatibility of OS 8, and 9.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_8
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9
 The PowerPC combined with OS X was a truly superior machine for its time (As is the Power 8 Chip Today) but that was a long time ago.
Oh, it was the ipod, itunes, and the iphone that saved Apple.

madrino



I’ve been an avid Apple user since the introduction of the Macintosh.  Unfortunately, the misguided steps of Beats, Watch and other non-core products show a lack of focus by the company for leading edge products.  It has become a gadget company outsourcing manufacturing for compromised products where return on investment is the only goal.  Without a significant upgrade to the MacPro and iMac this year, I will no longer be purchasing any of their products.






http://www.engadget.com/                Jon Fingas



They updated the iMac late last year, though (I’m using that model right now, in fact), and it’s entirely likely that you’ll see at least a mild refresh to it this year.








The Gnome



I’d love a new Macbook Pro but honestly the idea that mine has been solid for years and I haven’t had to worry about upgrading to get the latest new thing has been refreshing.     Thats not to say I’m not looking forward to something soon…  and I hope that one can stay “recent” for a few years after.   
As for Microsoft and the Surface.. um.. yea.   They DO have to keep iterating because its arguably still junk.   (maybe Windows is more to blame)






Joel Hruska



People I know seem fairly happy with the latest iteration of Surface. I haven’t reviewed one since the original Surface / Surface Pro, so I can’t comment much.








Mahmet Tokarev (Tajik Pride)



Lol at this pathetic attempt to rationalize Apple selling ancient hardware at wildly overblown prices with gigantic profit margins….
Just another day in the life of a lobotomized Apple cult drone-slave!






Joel Hruska



Did you miss the part where I don’t own any Apple laptops, desktops, or all-in-ones? 
I have an iPhone 5C that I bought when my old phone broke and Radio Shack sold it to me for $50. I’m a more expensive date then that, buddy. ;)








Void_Incarnate



Uh… nope. Variable Refresh Rate? High Refresh Rate? HDR Display? Vulkan? Thunderbolt 3/USB C? HDMI 2.0b/DP 1.4?
These are all technologies missing from Apple’s desktop (hahaha) lineup, with only the Macbook 2016 supporting TB3/USB-C, and even that does not hit the advertised transfer speeds.
High Refresh Rates are not just for gaming, I run my desktop at 120 Hz because it divides nicely into both 30 fps and 24 fps video content, making watching TV and movies much smoother than on my secondary 60 Hz monitor.
It’s not just about core counts and gigabytes, the user experience matters.






Joel Hruska



G-Sync/FreeSync, 120Hz displays, HDR, Tbolt 3, HDMI 2.0b/ DP 1.4 are all extremely uncommon in the PC notebook space. Boutique systems are the only places you’re going to find them outside of HDMI 2.0b, which can be had from NV or (I think) Skylake-class GPUs. AMD hasn’t launched the notebook variants of the GPUs that support those features yet. 
It’s true that Apple could update and refresh those features, but it’s not like the PC industry is shipping them in large numbers, either. As for Vulkan, Apple isn’t supporting it — but if it chose to, Vulkan *could* run on the AMD GPUs it already ships.

Apple is using old hardware with Mac Pro….If they wanted to be current they could use Xeon E5 v3 with 18 CPU cores (36 threads) x 2 CPUs = 36 CPU cores (72 threads) and that would completely blow away old, expensive Mac Pro:
http://ark.intel.com/products/81061/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2699-v3-45M-Cache-2_30-GHz






Joel Hruska



The Mac Pro isn’t dual-socket, though, so that’s a no-go. They *could* offer an 18-core CPU, but I addressed this:  That’s only useful to a limited customer base that can use them. If you need fewer cores and more clock, the benefits are much smaller.






Zoran



The point is that Apple are not using current hardware….whether your application needs it or not is not necessarily the point. Many power users including me need high end hardware and unfortunately Apple simply does not deliver. The old dual socket Mac Pro was far more versatile than current Mac Pro which is just a pretty toy with limited expansion.






Joel Hruska



“The old dual socket Mac Pro was far more versatile than current Mac Pro which is just a pretty toy with limited expansion.” 
Agreed. But that was true in 2013. 
“The point is that Apple are not using current hardware….whether your application needs it or not is not necessarily the point. ” 
I disagree. That’s *exactly* the point. 
Which would you rather have? 
1).  A situation in which a company doesn’t upgrade a product because it can’t deliver a tangible benefit. This means that if you bought your hardware in 2013, you don’t feel like you’re getting fleeced by ads for new products that aren’t actually better. 
2).  A situation in which a company upgrades hardware to remain current but doesn’t actually offer any benefits. They use marketing to *imply* benefits that don’t actually meaningfully exist. 
As a consumer I prefer #1. Some people might prefer #2 I suppose.






Zoran



Your original assertion was “Meet the new CPU, same as the old CPU”. That is simply not true….CPUs have advanced significantly and many high end applications need more powerful CPUs. 
Many users high end users like me are now using alternate powerful workstations like Dell Precision or HP Z which use current technology Intel Xeon E5 v3 CPUs.
There is a significant market for high end workstations and traditionally Apple used to value high end users…Yet Apple are now making to much money on consumer technology to care about their high end users. They are no longer keeping up!
If you need high end workstation look at alternatives!






Joel Hruska



All comparisons are made relative to two things: 
1).  What the company has previously sold. 
and
2).  What’s available on the market? 
I specifically state above that my comparison point is chosen to represent consumers who need *both* high clock speeds and solid core counts. Not all applications scale out well past a certain point. Photoshop, for example, doesn’t take advantage of higher core counts past about quad-cores. Other applications have their own limits. 
I can’t profile every single application that a person might use and the purpose of this article was not to evaluate whether the Mac Pro was or was not a good fit for any given workload. If, for example, you have an application that is embarrassingly parallel and can multi-thread for any number of CPU cores, then you probably don’t own a Mac Pro and this article does not apply to you. You can, as you note, buy a 2S system with Intel Xeon E5 v4 (not v3) processors. That’s 36 cores / 72 threads. But if you need 72 threads in a single system, you’re not buying a Mac Pro. 
And again — I note that the one upgrade that Apple could offer would be a higher core count. But if you’re a user who cares about CPU core count *and* clock speed, then a 16-core chip at 2.2GHz may not be faster than the 12-core chip at 3.5GHz.






Zoran



Once again….Apple have completely neglected high end users that require powerful CPUs for rendering, simulations, transcoding, development, running multiple VMs (my use case).
If user needs high core count Apple could offer Xeon E5 v4 with 2.2GHz CPUs (3.6GHz max) with 55MB cache, CPU with 22 cores and support for fast DDR4 memory.
http://ark.intel.com/products/91317/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2699-v4-55M-Cache-2_20-GHz
If not all CPU cores are being used the remaining cores can run at 3.6GHz (and still remain under thermal threshold)….this combined with larger caches and faster memory would blow away the old Mac Pro, furthermore if you have an application with a large working set footprint that not fit in much smaller cache footprint on old Mac Pro with E5-1620V2, then you have to access slow memory. Memory bandwidth/latency is a huge factor in applications performance. Lets say you have a 4GHz CPU and your memory is only 2GHz and the data is not in cache…then your CPU has to wait (slow down to 2GHz) to access memory. For more details see:
https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/
If user requires fastest possible single threaded performance Apple could offer i7-6700K :
http://ark.intel.com/products/88195/Intel-Core-i7-6700K-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_20-GHz
Apple are ignoring the high end workstation market!














Toe Knee Heel



Is there any chance they’ll switch to new Apple chips across their desktop range?  All their desktops are due for a renewal, and they’re bringing out a new version of macOS.  Could they have chips focused on power rather than efficient power use?  And an alternate version of macOS to run on the new Apple chips?






Joel Hruska



Probably not. I wrote about this two years ago, but nothing has changed since then: 
http://www.extremetech.com/computing/187513-why-apple-wont-dump-intel-x86-for-its-own-arm-chips-in-macbooks-and-the-mac-pro






Toe Knee Heel



Thanks for the pointer to your article.  A couple of thoughts, two years on…
– I’d have thought the world view of the importance of Windows software compatibility has diminished significantly as many major applications now have iOS (ARM) versions.  I believe there have been very few new Windows software applications developed outside the enterprise over the last few years. 
– The comparison of i7 to A9 chips shows the big disparity of performance, resulting in an inability to deliver chip unity from iOS to MacBook and Mac Pro.  However, much of the market seems to have settled into the i5, slower chips.  Without the restrictions of managing power consumption, I wonder how close Apple could get their chips to a competitive BIPS with specifically designed architecture?  Maybe the reception of the MacBook (v2) has demonstrated less users require raw power. 
– I’m sure there are some very clever hardware engineers at Apple that would like to design and build their own chips for the complete stack.  And sometimes, when the gauntlet is thrown down…
Ultimately, the timing just seems tactically interesting for September.  Apple has delayed releasing products across their entire macOS range. They are about to release a new version of macOS which includes a new file system (APFS), so they’ve created the opportunity to develop deep compatibility.  And they’ve kept new versions of their OS under wraps very well in recent years.  This September might just be interesting too…






Joel Hruska



The importance of Windows compatibility isn’t trivial when you consider that none of the professional applications people use have equivalent mobile applications. Adobe may make a photo manipulation program for iOS and they may even call it something like Photoshop (I haven’t checked), but it’s *not* full photoshop. You can’t run rendering software equivalents on ARM either. 
But the bigger issue here is that Apple is highly unlikely to switch until and unless it can deliver an ARM chip that is significantly faster than Intel across the entire product stack. Consider the Mac Pro, with its 12-core Intel CPU. If Apple wanted to, it could upgrade the Mac Pro to an option that includes a 22-24 core CPU. Does Apple have the expertise to build and design its own 22-24 core ARM chip for its own server? I doubt it. Not yet, anyway. 
Historically, Apple switches when two things are true: 
1).  It can gain performance for every product at every price level. 
2).  The performance gain is much more than just 5-8%. It wants 30-40% gains. 
Now they could always break from this pattern, so I’m not presenting this as gospel — but I suspect they will not. I think that if Apple decides to make a switch entirely to ARM, it won’t do so any time in the near future. Prototyping and bringing up a 22-24 core chip is difficult; that’s one reason why Intel’s higher-end multi-core Xeons lag about a year behind its consumer hardware.
It doesn’t make sense to move the Mac Mini and iMac to ARM if you still need x86 for the workstation line. So I don’t think we’ll see an ARM shift until Apple can deliver advances on ARM at every level and product type. 












The Shambolic Skeptic



Apologist is right on. Egads man. Everything needs to be current – and that includes graphics – given we’re paying top dollar for Macs.






freimacher



Apple users have to agree with Apple’s decisions whether they like it or not, so they rationalize reasons to keep a good image for their chosen brand.  With commodity PC hardware we have more choices.  I run Linux and Windows and build my own systems so I don’t have to kowtow to a single company if they’re lagging in innovation.
Think about it.  What if an Apple user wants a tablet with a good stylus that runs full desktop apps like Photoshop?  The loyalist will say it’s a bad idea because Apple hasn’t made one.  If they release one tomorrow it will suddenly be a good idea.






Kojen Ku



give us a software that no one consumer can refuse to buy and thus upgrade the hardware.






BorderGuard



So the author doesn’t know anything about graphics cards or storage.  Shouldn’t be writing on this topic.






Joel Hruska



The author is a hardware reviewer with 15 years of experience with everything from ray tracing equipment to 3D render stations, to consumer gaming. I cover storage, too. 
Now, if you’d like to disagree with something substantive, or raise an actual issue, or offer a viewpoint I can engage with, please feel free. :)








Madhuvidya Agnima



“If your workloads depend on GPUs and scale with graphics horsepower, you aren’t using Apple.”
In my industry, film and television, Apple hardware is the norm across many aspects of production. But the lack of hardware updates — especially for the Mac Pro — have people growing more and more tense by the day. Especially this month there has been a noticeable rise in frustration.






Brian



It isn’t a question of whether Apple should have updated their hardware. It’s the unqualified fact that Apply hasn’t made any innovations in the same amount of time. Apple, welcome to your decline.






danieleran



“in 2013, with the launch of the Mac Pro, it looked like Apple might embrace OpenCL, GPGPU programming and offload”
Uh, Apple created OpenCL. 
And Metal now incorporates GPGPU, effectively serving as a unified alternative to using OpenGL & OpenCL. 
That bizarre line greatly detracts from an otherwise serviceable article. 






Joel Hruska



“Uh, Apple created OpenCL.” 
Yes. And they’ve shamefully neglected it. 
http://www.cgchannel.com/2015/05/open-source-3d-devs-criticise-apples-opencl-support/
OpenCL is only supported on Apple hardware through 1.2. Because Apple writes its own drivers and bakes them into the OS, you can’t update them independently. Blender can’t run on the M370X for this reason.  https://developer.blender.org/T45071
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202823
OpenCL 1.2 was ratified on November 15, 2001. OpenCL 2.0 was ratified on November 18, 2013. Apple does not support OCL 2.0 on any of its hardware, including hardware with AMD graphics processors that are OCL 2.0 compatible under Windows. 
https://streamcomputing.eu/blog/2015-06-08/apple-metal-versus-vulkan-opencl-2-1/
As for why I say Apple continues to ignore graphics, my reasoning is simple. It’s been six years since they updated OpenGL on MacOS and nearly three years since they updated OpenCL. Are you going to tell me that there were no improvements or meaningful additions they could’ve supported during that time, even if they always intended to roll Metal long-term? 
I could believe that for OCL 2.0, since they were talking about it back in 2014. It’s a lot harder to believe for OGL, which they’d stopped updated long before.








KevinKillion



Apple offers three desktop choices:  a dinky little unimpressive looking cylinder with lousy expansion possibilities, a lower-performance machine that requires you to buy a monitor when what you want is just a computer, or its smallest computer that combines the worst of both, lower performance and poor expansion.






RaoulO



When they changed their name from Apple Computer they should have named themselves Apple (Hedge Fund). They’re just cashing in until they slide into their eventual irrelevance. iPhone is like the Apple II, it’s time will pass as well.






Anders Eklund



Lets not forget that Apple’s OpenCL drivers are really bad compared to Linux and Windows, another proof that Apple does not care about high performance computing.
