Welcome to SIGA Technologies
We are a company specializing in the development and commercialization of solutions for serious unmet medical needs and biothreats. Our lead product is TPOXX® (USAN tecovirimat, ST-246®) an orally administered antiviral drug that targets orthopoxvirus infections. While TPOXX is not yet approved as safe or effective by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, it is a novel small-molecule drug that is being delivered to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (“SNS”) under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (“Project Bioshield”).
Our Lead Product Candidate, TPOXX® 
SIGA believes that TPOXX® (USAN tecovirimat, ST-246®) is among the first new small-molecule drugs delivered to the Strategic Stockpile under Project BioShield. TPOXX is an investigational product that is not currently approved by the FDA as a treatment of orthopoxvirus infections such as smallpox, or any other indication. Nevertheless, the FDA has designated TPOXX for “fast-track” status, creating a path for expedited FDA review and eventual regulatory approval. TPOXX is a novel, patented oral drug that is easy to store, transport and administer. There could be several potential uses for an effective antiviral drug to treat orthopoxvirus infections: to reduce mortality and morbidity in those infected with the smallpox (or another orthopoxvirus) virus, to protect the non-immune who risk developing smallpox following virus exposure, and as an adjunct to the smallpox vaccine in order to reduce the frequency of serious adverse events due to the live virus used for vaccination. On May 13, 2011, SIGA signed a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “BARDA Contract”) pursuant to which SIGA agreed to deliver two million courses of TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile (“SNS”). The BARDA Contract is worth approximately $472 million, including $409.8 million for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of TPOXX (an additional 300,000 courses are being delivered to the SNS at no charge) and $62 million of potential reimbursements (the “Base Contract”). In addition to the Base Contract, the BARDA Contract also contains various options that are exercisable at BARDA’s discretion.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Operations[edit]
SIGA has strong relationship with federal agencies and academic laboratories for its research and development activities. SIGA is providing countermeasures to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and the Department of Defense (DoD), such as Category A pathogens using BSL-3 or -4 work.[3]
History[edit]
SIGA’s antiviral programs produce products to prevent pathogens and biodefense threats, using the robotics in the chemical compound library. The company’s bioinformatics infrastructure provides biological and chemical data and software platform for researchers to management and study (such as data mining). The current discovery targets are influenza virus (H5N1, H2N1), Bunyavirus (Rift Valley Fever virus, La Crosse virus), filovirus (Marburg virus, Ebola virus), flavivirus (West Nile virus).[4]
In September 2009, SIGA Technologies received a $1.6 million research fund from the National Institutes of Health ("NIH") for its broad-spectrum antiviral candidates.[5]
In August 2011, SIGA Technologies was awarded a $7.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop an antiviral drug for treating and preventing Lassa fever and others of Arenavirus origin.[6]
In 2011, SIGA was ordered to pay $232 million in damages in a legal dispute with PharmAthene over rights to the smallpox drug tecovirimat.[7]
In July 2013, SIGA Technologies delivered about 590,000 courses of its smallpox antiviral drug tecovirimat (Arestvy) to the United States Government's Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), meeting the requirement of Government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).[8]
In November 2013, SIGA laid off its entire research & development division located in Corvallis, Oregon. The company liquidated all laboratory equipment at auction from that site.
SIGA is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity.[9] The alliance is a public-private partnership and coalition of biopharmaceutical companies and academic organizations that promotes that works to ensure medical countermeasures are available to protect public health and improve national health security.[10]
In 2014, SIGA filed for bankruptcy protection.[11]
Products & services[edit]
SIGA’s products include tecovirimat (Arestvyr, ST-246), an orally administered antiviral drug for orthopoxviruses; anti-arenavirus drug for hemorrhagic fever classified as Category A agents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; anti-Orthopoxvirus Drug; Dengue Antiviral; Broad Spectrum Antiviral, screening for antivirals against Category A and B pathogens.[12]
Awards[edit]
In 2008, the company was selected as a winner of the Deloitte New York, New Jersey, Connecticut Technology Fast 50 Program for 2008, as a four-time winner of the reward.[13]
