It's no Moscow Farmers Market - that the manager, vendors and patrons can agree on.But Pullman Farmers Market manager Richard Link said that's not the point."The Moscow Market is very much a social event. And the things that they set up, policy wise, basically encourages that. And we wanted to really focus on the food and make it very local, very fresh food," Link said.





Tucked away in the Spot Shop Parking Lot at 240 NE Kamiaken Street, on Wednesday, eight vendors staked out tents for the market, which has been running since May 10. The market was attracting sporadic clusters of customers from the streets on the hot, summer solstice day. A child blew bubbles in the wind while local classic rock band, The Paradons, played live rock 'n' roll. Other children used chalk to write "Welcome" on the pavement.Customers might notice a lack of craft vendors at Pullman's market if they have ever visited Moscow's, which typically features dozens selling everything from soaps to jewelry. On Wednesday, Pullman's market featured homemade jams and bread and fresh farmed produce, meats and plants.The board running the market does not necessarily say no to craft vendors, but it is selective, Link said. It focuses on sponsoring local food. And though it is relatively small, Link said the people who do come, buy."And I think maybe a little bit of that is that we are inconvenient. You have to want to be here to be here," Link said with a laugh, adding the board is always searching for a better location.But one other factor might be preventing Pullman's market from reaching Moscow levels - state regulations.Wesley Harness of Kay's Krunch peanut brittle, based in Colfax, said the Moscow and Pullman markets are totally different - the company sells at both. His wife, Kay Pierson, boiled that difference down to Idaho and Washington state codes."A lot of Idaho people will not come to this market because they don't follow the same rules we do," Pierson said, adding she and Harness prepare their products in a commercial kitchen in Palouse to meet Washington regulations.At a booth for Omache Farm, based just southwest of Pullman, Margaret Parsley sold pork and vegetables. Her 7-year-old daughter, Alli, sat at her own miniature stand near the booth, selling manicures for $2 to $3."Since I got these for Christmas, I thought I could do people's nails," Alli said, sifting through her display of rainbow polish colors. She had yet to receive a customer Wednesday, but the most requested color this year has been her Crayola bubblegum-scented polish.





Though Margaret said there are not many differences in regulations for her products between state lines, she pointed out she cannot sell her eggs unless they have been washed in a sink outside of her living space, per Washington regulations. So Margaret does not sell eggs in Pullman but she does in Moscow on Saturdays.By contrast, Pioneer Produce owner Peggy Welsh currently sells her jams, herbs and vegetables solely in Washington as a relatively new grower with a small farm."I pretty much sell everything that I am able to produce so far. I'm getting bigger and bigger every year, but it takes a while, so I really don't have enough to go to the Moscow market yet," Welsh said.The Pullman Farmers Market runs every Wednesday through Oct. 18 with a rotation of live bands and vendors. The market has been extended to run from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. this year to give people time to come after work, Link said. The market used to run until 6 p.m.Taylor Nadauld can be reached at (208) 883-4630, by email to tnadauld@dnews.com and on Twitter @tnadauldarg.

Pullman 3000 Circuit Board Replacement
Hi there, we have a pullman 3000 installed in our house which we're having a few issues with. I have opened it up & found corroded joints & a blown capacitor in the circuit board. There are no ident numbers on the board for me to order a replacement. I was hoping I would be able to purchase a replacement, can you please advise if you are able to supply this part? 


Answer:
Unfortunately, we do not have cross-reference information available for Pullman 3000 central vacuum systems.  You may view our generic circuit boards by clicking of the following link: Generic Central Vacuum Circuit Board Options.  Please note that the mini-breaker and low voltage connection tower come with nuts that screw down and secure the board to the outside of the vacuum tank. If these two holes do not align with holes on the vacuum tank a new hole will have to be made. 




Replacement Bag For Pullman BIV-105?
I need replacement bags for a Pullman model BIV-105.

TX
John


Answer:
Pullman Holt filtration is typically a center weighted cloth filter and a plastic collection bag. Since Pullman no longer produces central vacuums or filtration, we recommend cleaning or washing the cloth filter, being sure it is completely dry before installation. Instead of the plastic bag you can use this http://builtinvacuum.com/bagsfilters/paper-bags.html elastic top paper bag. It fits like the plastic bag and works just as well.





Bang Unit to Start it - Bad Motor?
Would you have a motor for model number BIV102 ball bearing motor serial number 7178 amp13 volts 115. We have to bang it to start it.
                                               Thank you


Answer:
Yes, we have the motor on this page under the part number http://builtinvacuum.com/help/pullman/motor.html. It is the complete motor and new. If you have to bang the unit to start it then the motor needs to be replaced.




Electric Nozzle Replacement Needed
I have a Pullman central vacuum and I need an electric beater bar head.  Will other brands work,such as Nutone as I like those better.

Thanks.


Answer:
Most likely there are brushes that fit your wand and electrical connection. Note one of them is unique to the brand. Other brands may have been used and can be. There are a few styles and most are represented here http://builtinvacuum.com/brushes/electric.html. If you send a photo of the nozzle and hose connection, and the cord end we can certainly give you your options.




Pullman Never Clog Vacuum Parts
Hi - I have a Pullman BIV Never Clog.  I believe it was put into the house in the early '80s and it still works great.  I would like to buy a new hose and also need a new hard floor attachment. Do you have parts that will work for me?


Answer:
We have a lot of options for you. Full hose and tool kits, accessories and more. They are all compatible with your Pullman. Let us know if you have questions. You can get started here http://builtinvacuum.com/help/pullman.html 




Filter Type?
We just purchased the home and found we have a have a BIV 205.P2. and when i looked in the canister i found a plastic bag (like a trash bag).  there must be some paper filter bag or something in there rather than a plastic bag.  Can you help?

Bob


Answer:
Hi, the filter used in the Pullman is a center weighted cloth filter that hangs down when not in use. Sometimes there was a plastic bag at the bottom to make emptying easier, but that is not necessary. If your unit is 14 inches wide you can use this filter: http://builtinvacuum.com/retail/shopretail.php?part_no=711B




Which Motor is Replacement?
I'm the second owner of a house with a built in pullman vaccuum.  The motor is starting to fail (brushes no longer make good contact). How do I find out what I need for a motor.  Is there any numbering on the outside of the vaccuum (didn't see any) and if not, will I find what I need on the motor itself when I take it out?
Thanks.


Answer:
Hello, here is a link to our Pullman help page and it has a list of the models and the motors that go in them. Look near the minibreaker for a plate with the model number on it. Also, you can take a look at your motor and compare it with the photographs of the replacements on the Pullman motor section. It will be obvious which it is.




Pullman Model 95 Replacement Motor
Can you replace my Pullman vacuum cleaner motor BIV 95; serial number 427; 115 volt; 6.4 amps; 1 hp?  It is a ball-bearing motor.


Answer:
Yes, we are sure we have the motor you need. Please call us when you are near it so we can ask the right questions to find the right motor. 




Replacing Pullman Canister Unit
I just moved into my father in laws home and he has a Pullman BIV30 vacuum for the house. The motor is not sucking like it did 40 years ago. I want to replace it without having to change the piping in the house. 
Michael New Jersey


Answer:
Hello Michael, we have a full line of vacuum units that fit right into your existing pipe system. You can start reading about them here http://builtinvacuum.com/products.html. They are available through dealers here www.builtinvacuum.com/find-dealers.html. 




Pullman Model 108 Maintenance, Accessories
We inherited a Pullman BIV 108 and not sure about how to maintain the unit.  The suction is just ok.  We have very old hoses, etc. and probably ought to upgrade the hoses and attachments.  Our home is about 3,000 sq. ft and we have combo hardwood floors, area rugs and some wall to wall in the bedrooms.  I would appreciate recommendations on how to optimize the machine as well as equipment attachment recommendations.  Thanks! 


Answer:
Hello, congratulations on the vacuum. Assuming it is installed in the home already, all the maintenance required is dropping the bottom of it and emtying it. Then shaking the center weighted filter with a plastic bag over it. Yes, a new hose and tool kit will give you a much better performance and a new electric kit will clean the carpet better then ever before. Use the help here and call us if you have questions: http://builtinvacuum.com/help/pullman.html. If you want to test the system use this guide www.builtinvacuum.com/flowchrt.html. 




Better Filter?
looking for a replacement "never clog" filter for my pullman BIV105??


Answer:
Hello, we don't know about a perfect filter but we do sell a great replacement here http://builtinvacuum.com/retail/shopretail.php?part_no=710AV




Replace Vacuum Unit
I have a Pullman Holt 105 2hp central vac.  The unit just stopped working and I was looking to replace it.  I have learned here that they no longer make these units.  What do you recommend as the system is installed throughout the house or are they all made to standard size? 

Jennifer Great Neck, NY


Answer:
Hello Jennifer, they are all standard size so you can replace the unit with another brand such as SilentMaster or you can replace the motor in yours. Give us a toll-free call so we can give you your choices.




New Kit for Pullman
Imagine my surprise when I discovered our up-north vacation place has an older Pullman Power Brush Central Vac system installed! The base unit seems fine, but power brush, hose, & attachments appear "tired." I've tried to research on-line when I get home (3 hours away) and keep coming back to The Stealth on your website. How can I be sure to order the correct item? What is your return policy if I were to order the wrong item? Also, our place is closed up for the (Michigan) winter. Should I wait to order until spring when I can test immediately upon receipt?


Answer:
The Stealth will make all the difference in vacuuming with your Pullman. You have standard inlets so you need a 'corded' Stealth Kit. There is no shipping and a 30-day money back satisfaction guarantee (you pay the shipping back). Order the kit when you have that 30 day window open.




Replace BIV 205
I have a Pullman Holt Model  BIV 205 Central Vacuum about 15 years old. I want to replace the Power Unit.
The product code is;B205200. Do you sell such a unit, what is the cost? 


Answer:
Your model had lots of good CFM, or air flow. We recommend another dual motor system but one that is quieter and has better filtration. The best replacement would be the SilentMaster S2, in our opinion. Please click on the dealer locator on the top of this page and use your zip code to contact a dealer for a price.

Pullman Porters Take Their Place in History
Amtrak honors rail workers who paved the way for the black middle class. 
by Michael Zielenziger, AARP Bulletin, February 13, 2009|Comments: 0












They were dignified men who did undignified labor. They made beds and cleaned toilets. They shined shoes, dusted jackets, cooked meals and washed dishes in cramped and rolling quarters.
Yet the thousands of African American men who rode the nation’s railroads as Pullman porters between 1867 and 1969 changed history. In the face of adversity and racial prejudice, they created the first labor union for African Americans. They helped build the civil rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s, and exemplified the possibility of upward mobility for black males long before Barack Obama took up residence in the White House.




 Brian Kersey/AP A textile conservator examines a Pullman railroad porter hat dating from the 1930s.
“These are ordinary men who did extraordinary things,” noted Lyn Hughes, a Pullman porters historian, in a tribute to five former porters held this week at the Oakland, Calif., Amtrak station as part of Black History Month. As the award ceremony took place, passenger trains could be heard whistling and chugging to a stop on nearby tracks.
“You knew who they were,” Hughes said. “They dressed well, they carried themselves well. They were men of purpose and principle,” whose standard of excellence became the measure by which others were judged. Hughes, founder and curator of the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum in Chicago, has spent years compiling records of every porter, dining car worker and maid who served on the railroads into the book An Anthology of Respect.
Still the best-dressed men in any train station, none of the retired porters would dare speak with such immodesty about themselves. “It was a job, and you got used to it,” said Lee Gibson of Los Angeles, who started working for the Union Pacific Railroad in 1936 and still wears a crisp white shirt, tie and stylish dark suit at age 98. “You would get up each morning and do the best job you could and accept whatever comes. But it was a steady job and we got pretty good money. Got to travel the country, and the work wasn’t too hard. It was kind of fun, but you know, it was a service job.”
Like many Pullman workers, Gibson grew up in the South, in Louisiana and Texas, and was introduced to railroad work by a church deacon after moving to Los Angeles in 1935. “He carried me down to the superintendent’s office and he hired me right then. He told me, ‘You ought to make a good porter for us,’ so I went to work.”
Gibson thinks his work as a Pullman porter allowed him to stay married 76 years, until his wife passed away three years ago. “We had five days on the railroad and five days off. So by the time the wife was tired of you, you were gone. And by the time you got back, she was happy to see you again,” he said with a chuckle.
Troy Walker, 90, was born in Oklahoma and was working in a bar at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., when he learned he could get work on a Union Pacific dining car. “It was a good job. You made a lot of your money in tips because the salary wasn’t great. But we served first-class meals, and because we were in the dining car you got to meet a lot of movie stars and business people.” He remembers wearing tuxedo pants, a white dinner jacket and a black bow tie while waiting on his customers, who included director Orson Welles and actress Elizabeth Taylor. “In my era, it was about the only good job a black fella could get.” Walker, who stayed with the railroad for 37 years before retiring in Seattle, attended the Oakland ceremony with fellow honoree Thomas Henry Gray, 71, a third-generation railroad porter.




While the Pullman porters were held in high esteem in the black community, their historical legacy is often overlooked.
Chicago industrialist George Pullman began recruiting black men as porters on his new luxurious rail sleeper cars, which revolutionized train travel, just after the end of the Civil War. He was looking to hire men for his rolling hotels who were dignified and diligent, and who epitomized Pullman’s vision of safe, reliable and invisible servants. But the jobs came with a price. Historians note that for over a century, in the intimate confines of railcars that crisscrossed America, a Pullman porter had workloads lasting sometimes 400 hours per month and encountered indignities and outright humiliations from passengers. Most white customers called their porters “George” after Pullman, or simply “boy.”
For a time in the mid-20th century, more black American males worked for the railroads than anywhere else. The good pay and steady work made a Pullman uniform a status symbol for generations of African American families hoping to gain economic mobility. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and his father were both Pullman porters. So was the father of former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, as well as the father of Tom Bradley, the first black mayor of Los Angeles. Filmmaker Gordon Parks and activist Malcolm X also served as Pullman porters.
The porters were also inextricably linked to the union and civil rights movements. After contentious battles both within the black community and against management of the Pullman company, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, founded by A. Philip Randolph, won recognition in 1937 after a 12-year campaign. The union’s organizing slogan was “Fight or Be Slaves.”
In December 1955, when Rosa Parks refused to sit in the back of a Montgomery, Ala., municipal bus and was arrested, E.D. Nixon, a Pullman porter who headed the local branch of the NAACP, helped organize the pivotal Montgomery bus boycott. Randolph and one of his chief lieutenants, Bayard Rustin, were also the chief architects of the 1963 March on Washington. “They learned to organize by standing up for themselves and organizing a union,” Hughes said. “And perhaps unintentionally, they helped organize the civil rights movement, too.”
The porters disappeared in the 1970s when Amtrak took over the trains and porters became “attendants.” “The white people they hired didn’t want to be called ‘porter’ and they didn’t want to wear the uniform,” Walker explained.
But to train buffs like Brian Rosenwald, who used to hang out in Chicago’s Union Station as a teen and now is the chief of product management for Amtrak, the contribution of the Pullman porters remains vivid.
“You know it’s just cold steel,” Rosenwald said. “But these men gave the trains their soul.”
