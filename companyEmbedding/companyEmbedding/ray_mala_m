	Encision Reports Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Results










	BOULDER, Colo., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Encision Inc. (ECIA), a medical device company owning patented surgical technology that prevents dangerous stray electrosurgical burns in minimally invasive surgery, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter that ended March 31, 2017.


	The Company posted quarterly net revenue of $2.21 million for a quarterly net loss of $115 thousand, or $(0.01) per share. These results compare to net revenue of $2.29 million for a net loss of $282 thousand, or $(0.03) per share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin on net revenue was 52% in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and 46% in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. Gross margin on
	net revenue was lower in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter principally as a result of slow moving and obsolete inventory costs of $164 thousand. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes slow moving and obsolete inventory costs, was 53% in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.


	The Company posted twelve months net revenue of $8.87 million for a twelve months net loss of $729 thousand, or $(0.07) per share. These results compare to net revenue of $9.34 million for a net loss of $880 thousand, or $(0.08) per share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin on net revenue was 50% and 49% in the fiscal 2017 and 2016 twelve months, respectively.


	"Although our year over year fourth quarter revenue decreased, we are pleased that our AEM product revenue had a 2% comparable product increase," said Greg Trudel, President and CEO. "In our fiscal year 2017, we generated cash from operations
	principally by reducing our net inventories."


	Highlights of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and first quarter of fiscal 2018, to date:



	We began to sell our next-generation AEM® Burn Protection Cable at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.


	We received our initial order from the manufacturer of our next-generation durable monitors. We have received pre-orders and, after testing, we will begin to sell them in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.


	An NBC News Investigative Report produced and aired an insightful story on patient safety during laparoscopic surgery.  It highlighted the devastating impact that preventable stray energy burns can have on patients' lives.  The report used our videos and showed that these injuries can be eliminated with AEM® Technology. The report may be viewed at: http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/Surgery-Risk-Burns-Laparoscopic-Investigation-412929203.html?t=0


	Encision's Active Electrode Monitoring (AEM®) Technology received a new recommendation in the March 2017 issue of the AORN Journal (Guideline Implementation: Energy-Generating Devices, Part 1-Electrosurgery).  The article looks at a stray energy burn case study and recommends practical steps for the operating room team to adopt to reduce preventable patient injuries during the use of monopolar energy. The article may be viewed at:  https://www.aorn.org/websitedata/cearticle/pdf_file/CEA17508-0001.pdf


	We launched the Encision App. It may be downloaded by searching for "Encision Laparoscopic Surgery" in the App Store (iOS/Apple) and GooglePlay Store (Android). The Encision App is an easy way to access our information, including videos, directly from a phone or tablet.


	We were released from responding to subpoenas which were issued by the plaintiff and defendant in a lawsuit that we are not a party to. This will eliminate future legal fees in connection with the subpoenas.


	In a letter received from the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), we received a questionnaire regarding Stray Energy and how to prevent patient injuries from Stray Energy during laparoscopic procedures. We provided the FDA with extensive information on burns and our program for eliminating them. The FDA has not yet responded to us.


	We received a one-time, non-cancellable order from a customer for approximately $500 thousand of non-AEM product. We expect that approximately 55% of that order will be filled in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the balance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.



	Mr. Trudel added, "We continue to fine tune our operations as we roll out new products that promise to enhance market adoption of AEM® Technology and drive higher top and bottom line results. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, Peter Geary joined us as VP Operations. His knowledge of manufacturing will strengthen our executive team and improve our productivity. We have achieved good success to date with our AEM EndoShield®2 and are looking forward to the release of the EM3. The EM3 is our next-generation durable monitor, which will make AEM® Safety adoption even more
	attractive for our customers and drive new levels of performance and growth. After quarters of losses, we expect to achieve profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018."


	Encision Inc. designs and markets a portfolio of high performance surgical instrumentation that delivers advances in patient safety with AEM technology, surgical performance, and value to hospitals across a broad range of minimally invasive surgical procedures. Based in Boulder, CO, the company pioneered the development and deployment of Active Electrode Monitoring, AEM technology, to eliminate dangerous stray energy burns during minimally invasive procedures.



	In accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company notes that statements in this press release and elsewhere that look forward in time, which include everything other
	than historical information, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially include, among others, its ability to develop new or enhanced products and have such products accepted in the market, its ability to increase net sales through the Company's distribution channels, its ability to compete successfully against other manufacturers of surgical instruments, insufficient quantity of new account conversions, insufficient cash to fund operations, delay in developing new products and receiving FDA approval for such new products and other factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are encouraged to review the risk factors and other disclosures appearing in the
	Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of the receipt of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Description

From the director of Trader Horn and Tarzan the Ape Man comes this riveting Arctic adventure, the first feature film shot in Alaska and in a Native American tongue. When Mala (Ray Mala) is told there's a White Man's boat harbored in Tjarnak that will barter furs for guns, the Inuk makes the 500-mile trek across the tundra accompanied by his woman, Aba (Lulu Wong Wing). Trading his skins for a rifle, Mala goes out on a hunt, returning to learn Aba was killed while escaping the ship's lecherous captain (Peter Freuchen). Stabbing him dead, Mala goes home, unaware he's broken the White Man's law and that the Mounties are tracking him down. Based on two books by Peter Freuchen, the Danish explorer who plays the role of the captain, Eskimo also featured director W.S. Van Dyke doubling as Inspector White and received the 1934 Film Editing Oscar, the first ever awarded.

Movie


TitleEskimo


Release Year1933


Running Time117 min


CategoriesDramas / Adventure / Families / Infidelity / Vengeance


SynopsisThe remarkable location-filmed ESKIMO was adapted from two books: DIE FLUCHT INS WIESSE LAND and DER ESKIMO, both written by naturalist Peter Freuchen. Director Woody Van Dyke, in the tradition of his WHITE SHADOWS ON THE SOUTH SEAS and TRADER HORN, took his cast and crew on location to the Arctic, arriving by whaling schooner at the topmost settlement in Alaska with author Freuchen as his guide. Van Dyke, Freuchen, and cinematographer Ray Wise also played prominent on-screen roles in the film. Eskimo Ray Mala (billed only by his last name) essays the title role, speaking in the tongue of his ancestors (even though his English was excellent). Rather than use superimposed titles, Van Dyke resorted to old-fashioned silent-movie subtitles in several dialogue sequences. The story concentrates on the more exotic aspects of Eskimo life, notably the race's (alleged) casual approach to sex. Though tribal leader Mala has, by his own admission, slept with 20 women without benefit of clergy, woe betide anyone who tries to steal his current sweetheart -- as a rapacious trader discovers when he's harpooned to death by the cuckolded hero. Mala is ultimately undone by the Canadian Mounties, whose efforts to civilize the Eskimo community result in a sudden and tragic shift of the balance of power. Editor Conrad A. Nervig won an Oscar for his Herculean efforts to bring cohesiveness to the story. Performing respectably at the box office, ESKIMO inspired another location jaunt in 1935: LAST OF THE PAGANS, which also starred Ray Mala.

Atwill is the "god of life"






                        3 March 2014 | by utgard14

Mad scientist Lionel Atwill is at it again. This time he's run out of San Francisco for performing experiments that involve killing people so he can bring them back to life. He eventually makes his way to a tropical island where he uses his scientific abilities to fool the natives into thinking he has the power of resurrection. Minor Universal horror film is still enjoyable. Lionel Atwill is great as always. He's got some nice support from the likes of Noble Johnson, Claire Dodd, and John Eldredge. Nat Pendleton and cutie Una Merkel provide the comic relief. It's not a classic but any movie where Atwill plays a villain, especially a mad scientist, is worth checking out.

Product Description
In Republic Pictures’ 14 chapter serial, Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island, rugged G-man Ray Mala is sent to distant Clipper Island to investigate mysterious air disasters that have struck fear into the shareholders of Pacific Dirigible Airlines. Accompanied by his faithful four-footed comrades, Rex the stallion and Buck the dog; as well as crusty Scotchman Hank McGlaurie (William Newell) and English novelist Anthony Tupper (John Ward). 
Mala faces adversity and certain death as he races to uncover an international spy ring lead by the cloaked demon known only as H.K. Mala discovers that H.K. directs his nefarious henchmen out of a secret base on Clipper Island. While investigating this perilous mystery, Mala is diverted by local jungle politics when Princess Melani (Mamo Clark) is usurped by the evil priest, Porotu (John Picori), who turns out to be in league with the omnisciently evil H.K. High adventure, angry volcano gods and the shocking surprise identity of master spy H.K. make Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island a magnificent serial adventure.
Ray Mala, Rex – King of the Wild Horses, Buck, Mamo Clark, William Newll, Selmer Jackson, John Ward. John Picori. Directed by Ray Taylor and Mack V. Wright.
Not rated. Black and white. 12 chapters. 333 minutes. Region 0 encoding (can be played worldwide).
