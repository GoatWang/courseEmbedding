            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.

Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. Enters into New Credit Agreement
Jun 1 17
On June 1, 2017, Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. completed acquisition of RidgeWorth Holdings, LLC. To fund a portion of the purchase price for the RidgeWorth acquisition, the company entered into a credit agreement on June 1, 2017 with the lenders party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for: a $260.0 million term loan for the company with a seven-year term; and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility for the company with a five-year term. The company has the right, subject to customary conditions specified in the Credit Agreement, to request additional revolving credit facility commitments and additional term loans to be made under the Credit Agreement up to an aggregate amount equal to the sum of: $75.0 million; and unlimited amounts subject to a pro forma secured net leverage ratio of the company of no greater than 1.75 to 1.00. The proceeds of the term loans have been applied to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration for the company’s acquisition of RidgeWorth and fees and expenses in connection therewith. The Credit Agreement also provides for a $7.5 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including ongoing working capital requirements. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) for interest periods of one, two, three or six months (or, solely in the case of the revolving credit facility, if agreed to by each relevant Lender, twelve months or periods less than one month) (subject to a “floor” of 0% in the case of the revolving credit facility and 0.75% in the case of the term loan) or an alternate base rate, in either case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are initially set at 3.75%, in the case of LIBOR-based loans, and 2.75%, in the case of alternate base rate loans and will, following the first delivery of certain financial reports required under the Credit Agreement, range from 3.50% to 3.75%, in the case of LIBOR-based loans, and 2.50% to 2.75%, in the case of alternate base rate loans, based on the secured net leverage ratio of the Company as of the last day of the preceding fiscal quarter, as reflected in such financial reports. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to alternate base rate loans and on the last day of each interest period with respect to LIBOR-based loans (but, in the case of any LIBOR-based loan with an interest period of more than three months, at three-month intervals). The term loans will amortize at the rate of 1.00% per annum payable in equal quarterly installments. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the term loans be mandatorily prepaid with (a) 50% of the Company’s excess cash flow on an annual basis, stepping down to 25% if the Company’s secured net leverage ratio declines below 1.00 to 1.00 and stepping down to 0% if the Company’s secured net leverage ratio declines below 0.50 to 1.00, (b) the net proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty or condemnation events, subject to customary reinvestment rights, and (c) the proceeds of any indebtedness incurred other than indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the Credit Agreement. At any time, upon timely notice, the Company may terminate the Credit Agreement in full, reduce the commitment under the facility in minimum specified increments or prepay loans in whole or in part, subject to the payment of breakage fees with respect to LIBOR-based loans and, in the case of any term loans that are prepaid in connection with a “repricing transaction” occurring within the six-month period following the closing date of the Credit Agreement, a 1.00% premium. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the company is required to pay certain fees to the Lenders, including, among others, a quarterly commitment fee on the average unused amount of the revolving credit facility, which fee is initially set at 0.50% and will, following the first delivery of certain financial reports required under the Credit Agreement, range from 0.375% to 0.50%, based on the secured net leverage ratio of the Company as of the last day of the preceding fiscal quarter, as reflected in such financial reports. The obligations of the company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. In connection with the company’s entry into the Credit Agreement, on June 1, 2017, the company terminated its existing Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016, with the lenders party thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon, as agent, and the credit documents entered into in connection therewith.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
