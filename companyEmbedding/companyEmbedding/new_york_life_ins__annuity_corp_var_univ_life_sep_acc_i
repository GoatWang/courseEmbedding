With a little help, everyone can be good at life.





  











Get good guidance, so you can be good at life.


Financial Strength

                        Trust us, we’ve been doing this for over 170 years. Ask your great-great grandparents.
                    


Shared Ownership

                        We answer to you, not Wall Street. Together, we can make amazing things happen.
                    


Living Benefits

                        Call us crazy, but we think life insurance should benefit you while you’re, well, living.*

With New York Life helping manage your family’s financial future, you can live life and focus on the things that matter most to you. That’s what we call being good at life.    

Imagine a company that is owned by its policy owners** and designed to drive their collective financial strength. A company that can focus on doing the right thing because it never has to answer to Wall Street or shareholders. A company that has been around for over 170 years and only focuses on one thing: being there for its clients when they need it most and paying out dividends, even during major financial crises.*** A company that empowers its clients to make smart financial decisions that can benefit them throughout their lives.
New York Life is that company. And when you have that company by your side, you can stop worrying about financial things, and start being good at life.    
“We are more than a life insurance company. We help people achieve financial security and be good at life. It starts with helping clients make smart financial decisions today, knowing we will be there to keep our promises tomorrow.”

 Ted Mathas, CEO, New York Life

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

life insurance policies issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC) referenced above. You should read this information carefully and retain this supplement for future reference together with the Prospectus for your
policy. This supplement is not valid unless it is read in conjunction with the Prospectus for your policy. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as those included in your Prospectus. 
The purpose of this supplement is to note changes to (i) MainStay VP Cornerstone GrowthInitial Class that will become effective on or about
July 29, 2016; (ii) MainStay VP Cash ManagementInitial Class that will become effective on or about August 26, 2016; and (iii) the fees and expenses of UIF U.S. Real Estate PortfolioClass I that will become effective
July 1, 2016. Keeping these purposes in mind, please note the following:   


A.
Changes to MainStay VP Cornerstone GrowthInitial Class (the Cornerstone Portfolio)   


 
1.
Change in Subadviser.  Effective on or about July 29, 2016, the Cornerstone Portfolios current subadviser, Cornerstone Capital Management LLC, will be replaced by an interim subadviser,
Cornerstone Capital Management Holdings LLC.   


 
2.
Increase in Fees and Expenses.  In conjunction with the subadviser change, subject to shareholder approval, there will be an increase in the Cornerstone Portfolios total fund annual expenses, from

B.
Changes to MainStay VP Cash ManagementInitial Class   


 
1.
Name Change. The MainStay VP Cash Management portfolio will be renamed MainStay VP U.S. Government Money Market portfolio. Effective August 26, 2016, all references to MainStay VP Cash
ManagementInitial Class will be deleted and replaced with MainStay VP U.S. Government Money MarketInitial Class.   


 
2.
Delete and replace the section titled Funds and Eligible Portfolios  Money Market Fund Fees and Gates with the following: 
Money Market Fund Fees and Gates  The SEC has adopted rules
that provide that all money market funds can impose liquidity fees and/or suspend redemptions under certain circumstances. The liquidity fees can be up to 2% of the amount redeemed, and the suspensions of redemptions (redemption gates)
can last for ten (10) business days. Money market funds can impose these fees and gates (which could be applied to all Policy transfers, surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments from that portfolio) based on the liquidity of the funds
assets and other factors. All types of money market funds have the ability to impose these fees and gates, but government money market funds (that invest at least 99.5% of their assets in cash, U.S. government securities and/or repurchase agreements
that are secured by cash or government securities) are less likely to impose such fees and gates.   


C.
Changes to UIF U.S. Real Estate PortfolioClass I (UIF Real Estate Portfolio)   


 
1.
Reduction in Fees and Expenses.  Effective July 1, 2016, the maximum expense ratio for the UIF Real Estate Portfolios Class I shares will be decreased. Accordingly, effective July 1,
2016, the following entry will replace the existing entry for the UIF Real Estate Portfolio in the table titled Annual Portfolio Company Operating Expenses:

 (***)The Portfolios Adviser, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Inc., has agreed to reduce its advisory fee and/or reimburse the Portfolio so that Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses, excluding certain investment related expenses, taxes, interest and other extraordinary expenses (including litigation),
will not exceed 0.95%. The fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year or until such time as the Board of Directors of The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc. (the Fund) acts to discontinue all or a
portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate.

 INVESTING IN 
NYLIAC Variable Universal Life Separate Account-I  This
supplement amends the prospectuses (each a Prospectus, and together, the Prospectuses) for the New York Life variable universal life insurance policies listed above that are issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity
Corporation (NYLIAC). The purpose of this supplement is to describe changes to the investment options available under such policies. You should read this information carefully and retain this supplement for future reference together with
the Prospectus for your policy. This supplement is not valid unless it is read in conjunction with the Prospectus for your policy. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as those included in the Prospectuses. 
NYLIAC has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) for an order permitting the above-referenced separate account to
substitute shares of the Existing Portfolio with shares of the Replacement Portfolio below. NYLIAC anticipates that, if such order is granted, the SEC will issue the order approving the proposed substitution in early August 2016. The effective date
established for the substitution is expected to be on or about August 26, 2016 (the Effective Date). All expenses incurred in connection with the substitution will be paid by either NYLIAC or an affiliate. You will not incur any
fees or charges or any tax liability because of the substitution.   






Proposed Substitution

Existing Portfolio
  
Replacement Portfolio

Royce Micro-Cap Portfolio  Investment Class
  
MainStay VP Small Cap Core  Initial Class
 Prior to the Effective Date.  From the current date to the Effective Date, if you have allocations in the Existing
Portfolio, you may transfer such allocations to any other available investment option without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see the Limits on Transfers section in the Prospectus for your policy)) and
without the transfer counting toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. Such transfer will be based on the cash value of the Investment Division as of the close of the Business Day that we receive the
transfer request. All other transfers are subject to limitations, and may be subject to charges, as described in the Prospectus for your policy. Please see the Prospectus for your policy for information on how to complete transfers from the Existing
Portfolio to other investment options that we currently offer.  Until the Effective Date, we will continue to process automatic transactions (such as Dollar Cost
Averaging, Automatic Asset Rebalancing, and Interest Sweep), involving the Existing Portfolio, unless you provide us with alternate allocation instructions. Also note that the Existing Portfolio will not accept new premium payment allocations or
transfers as of the Effective Date. We have included the prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio along with this supplement. 


On the Effective Date.  Any of your cash value that remains in the Existing Portfolio will be redeemed.
Those redemptions will then be used to purchase accumulation units in the Replacement Portfolio. All policyowners affected by the substitution will receive a written confirmation of the transaction. The redemption and subsequent repurchase
transactions required to effectuate the substitution will not be treated as transfers that count toward the number of free transfers that may otherwise be made in a given Policy Year. 
Your cash value immediately prior to the Effective Date will be equal to your cash value immediately after the Effective Date; however, the number of accumulation units
you receive in the Replacement Portfolio may be different from the number of accumulation units in the Existing Portfolio. There will also be no change to your policys death benefit as a result of the substitution. 
On the Effective Date, all references in your Prospectus to the Existing Portfolio will be deleted. 
After the Effective Date.  Immediately following the Effective Date, the Existing Portfolio will no longer be available as an investment option under
the policies. In addition, for the thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, you may transfer all or a portion of your cash value out of the Replacement Portfolio to another investment option without any charge or limitation (except
potentially harmful transfers (see the Limits on Transfers section in the Prospectus for your Policy)) and without the transfer counting toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. Such
transfers will be based on the cash value of the Investment Division as of the close of the Business Day that we receive the transfer request. All other transfers are subject to limitations, and may be subject to charges, as described in the
Prospectus for your policy. Please see the Prospectus for your policy for information on how to complete transfers from the Replacement Portfolio to other investment options that we currently offer. 
We will also continue to process automatic transactions (such as Dollar Cost Averaging, Automatic Asset Rebalancing and Interest Sweep) after the Effective Date, except
that allocations previously processed to or from the Existing Portfolio will be processed to or from the Replacement Portfolio.  A complete list of the investment
options that are available under your policy is set forth in the Prospectus for your policy. You may obtain a copy of the Prospectus for your policy by calling
1-800-598-2019. Additional information regarding the Replacement Portfolio, including the investment objectives, policies, risks and fees and expenses, is contained in
the Replacement Portfolios fund prospectus included with this supplement.

 This agreement (the "Agreement") is between certain portfolios,
specified below and in Schedule C, of Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance     
Products Trust, an open-end management investment company organized as a        
business trust under Massachusetts law (the "Trust"), Franklin Templeton        
Distributors, Inc., a California corporation which is the principal underwriter 
for the Trust (the "Underwriter," and together with the Trust, "we" or "us") and
the insurance company identified on Schedule a ("you") and your distributor, on 
your own behalf and on behalf of each

segregated asset account maintained by you that is listed on Schedule B, as that
schedule may be amended from time to time ("Account" or "Accounts").            

   The purpose of this Agreement is to entitle you, on behalf of the
Accounts, to purchase the shares, and classes of shares, of portfolios of the   
Trust ("Portfolios") that are identified on Schedule C, solely for the purpose  
of funding benefits of your variable life insurance policies or variable annuity
contracts ("Contracts") that are identified on Schedule D. This Agreement does  
not authorize any other purchases or redemptions of shares of the Trust.        

2.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES                                         
2.1      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY YOU                

You represent and warrant that:                               

                 2.1.1 You are an insurance company duly organized and in good
standing under the laws of your state of incorporation.                         

               2.1.2 All of your directors, officers, employees, and other
individuals or entities dealing with the money and/or securities of the Trust   
are and shall be at all times covered by a blanket fidelity bond or similar     
coverage for the benefit of the Trust, in an amount not less than $5 million.   
Such bond shall include coverage for larceny and embezzlement and shall be      
issued by a reputable bonding company. You agree to make all reasonable efforts 
to see that this bond or another bond containing such provisions is always in   
effect, and you agree to notify us in the event that such coverage no longer    
applies.                                                                        

            2.1.3 Each Account is a duly organized, validly existing
segregated asset account under applicable insurance law and interests in each   
Account are offered exclusively through the purchase of or transfer into a      
"variable contract" within the meaning of such terms under Section 817 of the   
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code") and the regulations          
thereunder. You will use your best efforts to continue to meet such definitional
requirements, and will notify us immediately upon having a reasonable basis for 
believing that such requirements have ceased to be met or that they might not be
met in the future.                                                              

                2.1.4 Each Account either: (i) has been registered or, prior
to any issuance or sale of the Contracts, will be registered as a unit          
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act"); or (ii) 
has not been so registered in proper reliance upon an exemption from            
registration under Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act; if the Account is exempt from  
registration as an investment company under Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act, you   
will use your best efforts to maintain such exemption and will notify us        
immediately upon having a reasonable basis for believing that such exemption no 
longer applies or might not apply in the future.                                

                 2.1.5 The Contracts or interests in the Accounts: (i) are or,
prior to any issuance or sale will be, registered as securities under the       
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"); or (ii) are not registered 
because they are properly exempt from registration

under Section 3(a)(2) of the 1933 Act or will be offered exclusively in         
transactions that are properly exempt from registration under Section 4(2) or   
Regulation D of the 1933 Act, in which case you will make every effort to       
maintain such exemption and will notify us immediately upon having a reasonable 
basis for believing that such exemption no longer applies or might not apply in 
the future.                                                                     

               2.1.6 The Contracts: (i) will be sold by broker-dealers, or
their registered representatives, who are registered with the Securities and    
Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as   
amended (the "1934 Act") and who are members in good standing of the National   
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"); (ii) will be issued and   
sold in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal and     
state laws; and (iii) will be sold in compliance in all material respects with  
state insurance suitability requirements and NASD suitability guidelines.       

            2.1.7 The Contracts currently are and will be treated as
annuity contracts or life insurance contracts under applicable provisions of the
Code and you will use your best efforts to maintain such treatment; you will    
notify us immediately upon having a reasonable basis for believing that any of  
the Contracts have ceased to be so treated or that they might not be so treated 
in the future.                                                                  

               2.1.8 The fees and charges deducted under each Contract, in
the aggregate, are reasonable in relation to the services rendered, the expenses
expected to be incurred, and the risks assumed by you.                          

                  2.1.9 You will use shares of the Trust only for the purpose of
funding benefits of the Contracts through the Accounts.                         

           2.1.10 Contracts will not be sold outside of the United
States.                                                                         

             2.1.11 With respect to any Accounts which are exempt from
registration under the 1940 Act in reliance on 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7)       
thereof:                                                                        

                         2.1.11.1    the principal underwriter for each such
                                      Account and any subaccounts thereof is a
                                   registered broker-dealer with the SEC
                 under the 1934 Act;

                           2.1.11.2    the shares of the Portfolios of the Trust
                                  are and will continue to be the only
                               investment securities held by the
                            corresponding subaccounts; and

                     2.1.11.3    with regard to each Portfolio, you,
                            on behalf of the corresponding
               subaccount, will:

                                     (a)  vote such shares held by it in the
                                          same proportion as the vote of all
                                         other holders of such shares; and

                                      (b)  refrain from substituting shares of
                                        another security for such shares
                                        unless the SEC has approved such

                                           substitution in the manner provided
                                      in Section 26 of the 1940 Act.

              2.1.12 You undertake and agree to comply, and to take full
responsibility in complying with any and all laws, regulations, protocols and   
other requirements relating to money laundering both United States and foreign, 
including, without limitation, the International Money Laundering Abatement and 
Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001 (Title III of the USA Patriot Act),        
hereinafter, collectively with the rules, regulations and orders promulgated    
thereunder, the "Act," and any requirements and/or requests in connection       
therewith, made by regulatory authorities, the Trust or the Underwriter or their
duly appointed agents, either generally or in respect of a specific transaction,
and/or in the context of a "primary money laundering concern" as defined in the 
Act.                                                                            

You agree as a condition precedent to any transaction taking or continuing to be
in effect, to comply with any and all anti-money laundering laws, regulations,  
orders or requirements, and without prejudice to the generality of the above, to
provide regulatory authorities, the Trust, the Underwriter or their duly        
appointed agents, with all necessary reports and information for them to fulfill
their obligations, if any, under the Act for the purposes of the Trust, the     
Underwriter, or other third parties complying with any and all anti-money       
laundering requirements, including, without limitation, the enhanced due        
diligence obligations imposed by the Act, the filing of Currency Transaction    
Reports and/or of Suspicious Activity Reports obligations required by the Act,  
and/or the sharing of information requirements imposed by the Act.              

In the event satisfactory reports and information are not received within a     
reasonable time period from the date of the request, the Trust or the           
Underwriter reserve the right to reject any transaction and/or cease to deal    
with you and/or the Accounts.                                                   

Further, you represent that you have not received notice of, and to your        
knowledge, there is no basis for, any claim, action, suit, investigation or     
proceeding that might result in a finding that you are not or have not been in  
compliance with the Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  
You agree to notify the Trust and the Underwriter immediately if the            
representation in the previous sentence is no longer true or if you have        
reasonable basis for believing that such representation may no longer be true.  

2.2      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE TRUST          

The Trust represents and warrants that:                       

                  2.2.1 It is duly organized and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Massachusetts.                                                  

              2.2.2 All of its directors, officers, employees and others
dealing with the money and/or securities of a Portfolio are and shall be at all 
times covered by a blanket fidelity bond or similar coverage for the benefit of 
the Trust in an amount not less than the minimum coverage required by Rule 17g-1
or other regulations under the 1940 Act. Such bond shall include coverage for   
larceny and embezzlement and be issued by a reputable bonding company.          

4 

P-->EX-99.H.155th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
               2.2.3 It is registered as an open-end management investment
company under the 1940 Act.                                                     

                2.2.4 Each class of shares of the Portfolios of the Trust is
registered under the 1933 Act.                                                  

                 2.2.5 It will amend its registration statement under the 1933
Act and the 1940 Act from time to time as required in order to effect the       
continuous offering of its shares.                                              

                 2.2.6 It will comply, in all material respects, with the 1933
and 1940 Acts and the rules and regulations thereunder.                         

              2.2.7 It is currently qualified as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Code, it will make every effort to maintain  
such qualification, and will notify you immediately upon having a reasonable    
basis for believing that it has ceased to so qualify or that it might not so    
qualify in the future.                                                          

                2.2.8 The Trust will use its best efforts to comply with the
diversification requirements for variable annuity, endowment or life insurance  
contracts set forth in Section 817(h) of the Code, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, including without limitation Treasury Regulation 1.817-5. Upon      
having a reasonable basis for believing any Portfolio has ceased to comply and  
will not be able to comply within the grace period afforded by Regulation       
1.817-5, the Trust will notify you immediately and will take all reasonable     
steps to adequately diversify the Portfolio to achieve compliance.              

                2.2.9 It currently intends for one or more classes of shares
(each, a "Class") to make payments to finance its distribution expenses,        
including service fees, pursuant to a plan ("Plan") adopted under rule 12b-1    
under the 1940 Act ("Rule 12b-1"), although it may determine to discontinue such
practice in the future. To the extent that any Class of the Trust finances its  
distribution expenses pursuant to a Plan adopted under rule 12b-1, the Trust    
undertakes to comply with any then current SEC interpretations concerning rule  
12b-1 or any successor provisions.                                              

2.3      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE UNDERWRITER    

The Underwriter represents and warrants that:                 

                2.3.1 It is registered as a broker dealer with the SEC under
the 1934 Act, and is a member in good standing of the NASD.                     

                2.3.2 Each investment adviser listed on Schedule C (each, an
"Adviser") is duly registered as an investment adviser under the Investment     
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and any applicable state securities law.      

2.4      WARRANTY AND AGREEMENT BY BOTH YOU AND US            

     We received an order from the SEC dated November 16, 1993 (file no.
812-8546), which was amended by a notice and an order we received on September
17, 1999 and October 13, 1999,

respectively (file no. 812-11698) (collectively, the "Shared Funding Order,"    
attached to this Agreement as Schedule H). The Shared Funding Order grants      
exemptions from certain provisions of the 1940 Act and the regulations          
thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Trust to be sold to  
and held by variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of   
both affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies and qualified pension 
and retirement plans outside the separate account context. You and we both      
warrant and agree that both you and we will comply with the "Applicants'
Conditions" prescribed in the Shared Funding Order as though such conditions    
were set forth verbatim in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the   
provisions regarding potential conflicts of interest between the separate       
accounts which invest in the Trust and regarding contract owner voting          
privileges. In order for the Trust's Board of Trustees to perform its duty to   
monitor for conflicts of interest, you agree to inform us of the occurrence of  
any of the events specified in condition 2 of the Shared Funding Order to the   
extent that such event may or does result in a material conflict of interest as 
defined in that order.                                                          

3.       PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF TRUST PORTFOLIO SHARES                      

         3.1 We will make shares of the Portfolios available to the Accounts for
the benefit of the Contracts. The shares will be available for purchase at the  
net asset value per share next computed after we (or our agent) receive a       
purchase order, as established in accordance with the provisions of the then    
current prospectus of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust's     
Board of Trustees ("Trustees") may refuse to sell shares of any Portfolio to any
person, or may suspend or terminate the offering of shares of any Portfolio if  
such action is required by law or by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction 
or if, in the sole discretion of the Trustees, they deem such action to be in   
the best interests of the shareholders of such Portfolio. Without limiting the  
foregoing, the Trustees have determined that there is a significant risk that   
the Trust and its shareholders may be adversely affected by investors whose     
purchase and redemption activity follows a market timing pattern, and have      
authorized the Trust, the Underwriter and the Trust's transfer agent to adopt   
procedures and take other action (including, without limitation, rejecting      
specific purchase orders) as they deem necessary to reduce, discourage or       
eliminate market timing activity. You agree to cooperate with us to assist us in
implementing the Trust's restrictions on purchase and redemption activity that  
follows a market timing pattern.                                                

 3.2 We agree that shares of the Trust will be sold only to life
insurance companies which have entered into fund participation agreements with  
the Trust ("Participating Insurance Companies") and their separate accounts or  
to qualified pension and retirement plans in accordance with the terms of the   
Shared Funding Order. No shares of any Portfolio will be sold to the general    
public.                                                                         

        3.3 You agree that all net amounts available under the Contracts shall
be invested in: (i) the Company's general account; (ii) investment companies    
currently available as funding vehicles for the Contracts and appearing on      
Schedule E of this Agreement; or (iii) other investment companies, provided that
you shall have given the Trust and the Underwriter thirty (30) days' advance    
written notice of your intention to add such other investment companies.        

         3.4 You shall be the designee for us for receipt of purchase orders and
requests for redemption resulting from investment in and payments under the     
Contracts ("Instructions"). The                                                 

6 

P-->EX-99.H.157th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
Business Day on which such Instructions are received in proper form by you and  
time stamped by the close of trading will be the date as of which Portfolio     
shares shall be deemed purchased, exchanged, or redeemed as a result of such    
Instructions. Instructions received in proper form by you and time stamped after
the close of trading on any given Business Day shall be treated as if received  
on the next following Business Day. You warrant that all orders, Instructions   
and confirmations received by you which will be transmitted to us for processing
on a Business Day will have been received and time stamped prior to the Close of
Trading on that Business Day. Instructions we receive after 9 a.m. Eastern Time 
shall be processed on the next Business Day. "Business Day" shall mean any day  
on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the Trust 
calculates its net asset value pursuant to the rules of the SEC and its current 
prospectus.                                                                     

        3.5 We shall calculate the net asset value per share of each Portfolio
on each Business Day, and shall communicate these net asset values to you or    
your designated agent on a daily basis as soon as reasonably practical after the
calculation is completed (normally by 6:30 p.m. Eastern time).                  

        3.6 You shall submit payment for the purchase of shares of a Portfolio
on behalf of an Account in federal funds transmitted by wire to the Trust or to 
its designated custodian, which must receive such wires no later than the close 
of the Reserve Bank, which is 6:00 p.m. East Coast time, on the Business Day    
following the Business Day as of which such purchases orders are made.          

         3.7 We will redeem any full or fractional shares of any Portfolio, when
requested by you on behalf of an Account, at the net asset value next computed  
after receipt by us (or our agent) of the request for redemption, as established
in accordance with the provisions of the then current prospectus of the Trust.  
We shall make payment for such shares in the manner we establish from time to   
time, but in no event shall payment be delayed for a greater period than is     
permitted by the 1940 Act.                                                      

         3.8 Issuance and transfer of the Portfolio shares will be by book entry
only. Stock certificates will not be issued to you or the Accounts. Portfolio   
shares purchased from the Trust will be recorded in the appropriate title for   
each Account or the appropriate subaccount of each Account.                     

        3.9 We shall furnish, on or before the ex-dividend date, notice to you
of any income dividends or capital gain distributions payable on the shares of  
any Portfolio. You hereby elect to receive all such income dividends and capital
gain distributions as are payable on shares of a Portfolio in additional shares 
of that Portfolio, and you reserve the right to change this election in the     
future. We will notify you of the number of shares so issued as payment of such 
dividends and distributions.                                                    

  3.10 Each party to this Agreement agrees that, in the event of a
material error resulting from incorrect information or confirmations, the       
parties will seek to comply in all material respects with the provisions of     
applicable federal securities laws.                                             

4.       FEES, EXPENSES, PROSPECTUSES, PROXY MATERIALS AND REPORTS              

7 

P-->EX-99.H.158th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
 4.1 We shall pay no fee or other compensation to you under this
Agreement except as provided on Schedule F, if attached.                        

      4.2 We shall prepare and be responsible for filing with the SEC, and
any state regulators requiring such filing, all shareholder reports, notices,   
proxy materials (or similar materials such as voting instruction solicitation   
materials), prospectuses and statements of additional information of the Trust. 
We shall bear the costs of preparation and filing of the documents listed in the
preceding sentence, registration and qualification of the Trust's shares of the 
Portfolios.                                                                     

        4.3 We shall use reasonable efforts to provide you, on a timely basis,
with such information about the Trust, the Portfolios and each Adviser, in such 
form as you may reasonably require, as you shall reasonably request in          
connection with the preparation of disclosure documents and annual and          
semi-annual reports pertaining to the Contracts.                                

        4.4 At your option, we shall provide you, at our expense, with either:
(i) for each Contract owner who is invested through the Account in a subaccount 
corresponding to a Portfolio ("designated subaccount"), one copy of each of the 
following documents on each occasion that such document is required by law or   
regulation to be delivered to such Contract owner who is invested in a          
designated subaccount: the Trust's current prospectus, annual report,           
semi-annual report and other shareholder communications, including any          
amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, pertaining specifically to   
the Portfolios ("Designated Portfolio Documents"); or (ii) a camera ready copy  
of such Designated Portfolio Documents in a form suitable for printing and from 
which information relating to series of the Trust other than the Portfolios has 
been deleted to the extent practicable. In connection with clause (ii) of this  
paragraph, we will pay for proportional printing costs for such Designated      
Portfolio Documents in order to provide one copy for each Contract owner who is 
invested in a designated subaccount on each occasion that such document is      
required by law or regulation to be delivered to such Contract owner, and       
provided the appropriate documentation is provided and approved by us. We shall 
provide you with a copy of the Trust's current statement of additional          
information, including any amendments or supplements, in a form suitable for you
to duplicate. The expenses of furnishing, including mailing, to Contract owners 
the documents referred to in this paragraph shall be borne by you. For each of  
the documents provided to you in accordance with clause (i) of this paragraph   
4.4, we shall provide you, upon your request and at your expense, additional    
copies. In no event shall we be responsible for the costs of printing or        
delivery of Designated Portfolio Documents to potential or new Contract owners  
or the delivery of Designated Portfolio Documents to existing contract owners.  

4.5 We shall provide you, at our expense, with copies of any  
Trust-sponsored proxy materials in such quantity as you shall reasonably require
for distribution to Contract owners who are invested in a designated subaccount.
You shall bear the costs of distributing proxy materials (or similar materials  
such as voting solicitation instructions) to Contract owners.                   

  4.6 You assume sole responsibility for ensuring that the Trust's
prospectuses, shareholder reports and communications, and proxy materials are   
delivered to Contract owners in accordance with applicable federal and state    
securities laws.                                                                

5.       VOTING                                                                 

8 

P-->EX-99.H.159th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
      5.1 All Participating Insurance Companies shall have the obligations
and responsibilities regarding pass-through voting and conflicts of interest    
corresponding to those contained in the Shared Funding Order.                   

         5.2 If and to the extent required by law, you shall: (i) solicit voting
instructions from Contract owners; (ii) vote the Trust shares in accordance with
the instructions received from Contract owners; and (iii) vote Trust shares for 
which no instructions have been received in the same proportion as Trust shares 
of such Portfolio for which instructions have been received; so long as and to  
the extent that the SEC continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require          
pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners. You reserve the    
right to vote Trust shares held in any Account in your own right, to the extent 
permitted by law.                                                               

         5.3 So long as, and to the extent that, the SEC interprets the 1940 Act
to require pass-through voting privileges for Contract owners, you shall provide
pass-through voting privileges to Contract owners whose Contract values are     
invested, through the Accounts, in shares of one or more Portfolios of the      
Trust. We shall require all Participating Insurance Companies to calculate      
voting privileges in the same manner and you shall be responsible for assuring  
that the Accounts calculate voting privileges in the manner established by us.  
With respect to each Account, you will vote shares of each Portfolio of the     
Trust held by an Account and for which no timely voting instructions from       
Contract owners are received in the same proportion as those shares held by that
Account for which voting instructions are received. You and your agents will in 
no way recommend or oppose or interfere with the solicitation of proxies for    
Portfolio shares held to fund the Contracts without our prior written consent,  
which consent may be withheld in our sole discretion.                           

6.       SALES MATERIAL, INFORMATION AND TRADEMARKS

television, telephone or tape recording, videotape display, signs or billboards,
motion pictures, electronic communication or other public media), sales

any other advertisement, sales literature or published article or electronic    
communication), educational or training materials or other communications       
distributed or made generally available to some or all agents or employees in   
any media, and disclosure documents, shareholder reports and proxy materials.

at least one complete copy of each registration statement, prospectus, statement
of additional information, private placement memorandum, retirement plan        
disclosure information or other disclosure documents or similar information, as 
applicable (collectively "Disclosure Documents"), as well as any report,        
solicitation for voting instructions, Sales literature or other Promotional     
materials, and all amendments to any of the above that relate to the Contracts  
or the Accounts prior to its first use. You shall furnish, or shall cause to be 
furnished, to us or our designee each piece of Sales literature or other        
Promotional material in which the Trust or an Adviser is named, at least fifteen

            7.1.2 You shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any Losses to which an Indemnified Party would        
otherwise be subject by reason of such Indemnified Party's willful misfeasance, 
bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such Indemnified Party's   
duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party's reckless disregard of           
obligations and duties under this Agreement or to the Trust or Underwriter,     
whichever is applicable. You shall also not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any claim made against an Indemnified Party unless    
such Indemnified Party shall have notified you in writing within a reasonable   
time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the   
nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Indemnified Party (or after
such Indemnified Party shall have received notice of such service on any        
designated agent), but failure to notify you of any such claim shall not relieve
you from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party against whom  
such action is brought otherwise than on account of this indemnification        
provision. In case any such action is brought against the Indemnified Parties,  
you shall be entitled to participate, at your own expense, in the defense of    
such action. Unless the Indemnified Party releases you from any further         
obligations under this Section 7.1, you also shall be entitled to assume the    
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.    
After notice from you to such party of your election to assume the defense      
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any          
additional counsel retained by it, and you will not be liable to such party     
under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by   
such party independently in connection with the defense thereof other than      
reasonable costs of investigation.

commencement of any litigation or proceedings against them in connection with   
the issuance or sale of the Trust shares or the Contracts or the operation of   
the Trust.

in connection therewith) (collectively, "Losses") to which the Indemnified      
Parties may become subject under any statute, at common law or otherwise,       
insofar as such Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of the shares of  
the Trust or the Contracts and:

Trust (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing)
         (collectively, the "Trust Documents") or arise out of or are based upon

     conduct of the Trust, Adviser or Underwriter or persons under their
       control, with respect to the sale or distribution of the Contracts or
Trust shares; or

         or sales literature covering the Contracts, or any amendment thereof or
  supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state
       therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
  make the statement or statements therein not misleading, if such
       statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished
to you by or on behalf of the Trust; or

        provide the services and furnish the materials under the terms of this
        Agreement (including a failure, whether unintentional or in good faith
         or otherwise, to comply with the qualification representation specified
       above in Section 2.2.7 and the diversification requirements specified
above in Section 2.2.8); or

with the provisions of Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 hereof.       

        7.2.2 The Underwriter shall not be liable under this
indemnification provision with respect to any Losses to which an Indemnified    
Party would otherwise be subject by reason of such Indemnified Party's willful  
misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such          
Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party's reckless    
disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement or to you or the       
Accounts, whichever is applicable.                                              

        7.2.3 The Underwriter shall not be liable under this
indemnification provision with respect to any claim made against an Indemnified 
Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the Underwriter in      
writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process 
giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such  
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice of
such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the Underwriter of 
any such claim shall not relieve the Underwriter from any liability which it may
have to the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than
on account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, the Underwriter will be entitled to

named in the action. After notice from the Underwriter to such party of the     
Underwriter's election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party     
shall bear the expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the       
Underwriter will not be liable to such party under this Agreement for any legal 
or other expenses subsequently incurred by such party independently in          
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of              
investigation.

damages, liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement with the written     
consent of the Trust, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or      
litigation (including legal and other expenses) to which the Indemnified Parties
may become subject under any statute, at common law or otherwise, insofar as    
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect    
thereof) or settlements result from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful  
misconduct of the Board or any member thereof, are related to the operations of 
the Trust, and arise out of or result from any material breach of any           
representation and/or warranty made by the Trust in this Agreement or arise out 
of or result from any other material breach of this Agreement by the Trust; as  
limited by and in accordance with the provisions of Sections 7.3.2 and 7.3.3    
hereof. It is understood and expressly stipulated that neither the holders of   
shares of the Trust nor any Trustee, officer, agent or employee of the Trust    
shall be personally liable hereunder, nor shall any resort be had to other      
private property for the satisfaction of any claim or obligation hereunder, but 
the Trust only shall be liable.                                                 

                  7.3.2 The Trust shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation
incurred or assessed against any Indemnified Party as such may arise from such  
Indemnified Party's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the  
performance of such Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such Indemnified 
Party's reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement or to

the opinion of your counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to  
us) to the effect that any redemption pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section   
9.9 is a Legally Required Redemption. Furthermore, you shall not prevent        
Contract owners from allocating payments to any Portfolio that has been         
available under a Contract without first giving us ninety (90) days advance     
written notice of your intention to do so.

Each Portfolio named below shall pay the following amounts pursuant to the terms
and conditions referenced below under its Class 2 Rule 12b-1 Distribution Plan, 
stated as a percentage per year of Class 2's average daily net assets

AGREEMENT PROVISIONS                                                            

     If the Company, on behalf of any Account, purchases Trust Portfolio
shares ("Eligible Shares") which are subject to a Rule 12b-1 plan adopted under 
the 1940 Act (the "Plan"), the Company may participate in the Plan.             

  To the extent the Company or its affiliates, agents or designees
(collectively "you") provide any activity or service which is primarily intended
to assist in the promotion, distribution or account servicing of Eligible Shares
("Rule 12b-1 Services") or variable contracts offering Eligible Shares, the     
Underwriter, the Trust or their affiliates (collectively, "we") may pay you a   
Rule 12b-1 fee. "Rule 12b-1 Services" may include, but are not limited to,      
printing of prospectuses and reports used for sales purposes, preparing and     
distributing sales literature and related expenses, advertisements, education of
dealers and their representatives, and similar distribution-related expenses,   
furnishing personal services to owners of Contracts which may invest in Eligible
Shares ("Contract Owners"), education of Contract Owners, answering routine     
inquiries regarding a Portfolio, coordinating responses to Contract Owner       
inquiries regarding the Portfolios, maintaining such accounts or providing such 
other enhanced services as a Trust Portfolio or Contract may require, or        
providing other services eligible for service fees as defined under NASD rules. 
Your acceptance of such compensation is your acknowledgment that eligible       
services have been rendered. All Rule 12b-1 fees, shall be based on the value of
Eligible Shares owned by the Company on behalf of its Accounts, and shall be    
calculated on the basis and at the rates set forth in the Compensation Schedule 
stated above. The aggregate annual fees paid pursuant to each Plan shall not    
exceed the amounts stated as the "annual maximums" in the Portfolio's           
prospectus, unless an increase is approved by shareholders as provided in the   
Plan. These maximums shall be a specified percent of the value of a Portfolio's 
net assets attributable to Eligible Shares owned by the Company on behalf of its
Accounts (determined in the same manner as the Portfolio uses to compute its net
assets as set forth in its effective Prospectus). The Rule 12b-1 fee will be    
paid to you within thirty (30) days after the end of the three-month periods    
ending in January, April, July and October.                                     

   You shall furnish us with such information as shall reasonably be
requested by the Trust's Boards of Trustees ("Trustees") with respect to the    
Rule 12b-1 fees paid to you pursuant to the

Plans. We shall furnish to the Trustees, for their review on a quarterly basis, 
a written report of the amounts expended under the Plans and the purposes for   
which such expenditures were made.                                              

       The Plans and provisions of any agreement relating to such Plans must
be approved annually by a vote of the Trustees, including the Trustees who are  
not interested persons of the Trust and who have no financial interest in the   
Plans or any related agreement ("Disinterested Trustees"). Each Plan may be     
terminated at any time by the vote of a majority of the Disinterested Trustees, 
or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding shares as provided in the Plan, on
sixty (60) days' written notice, without payment of any penalty. The Plans may  
also be terminated by any act that terminates the Underwriting Agreement between
the Underwriter and the Trust, and/or the management or administration agreement
between Franklin Advisers, Inc. and its affiliates and the Trust. Continuation  
of the Plans is also conditioned on Disinterested Trustees being ultimately     
responsible for selecting and nominating any new Disinterested Trustees. Under  
Rule 12b-1, the Trustees have a duty to request and evaluate, and persons who   
are party to any agreement related to a Plan have a duty to furnish, such       
information as may reasonably be necessary to an informed determination of      
whether the Plan or any agreement should be implemented or continued. Under Rule
12b-1, the Trust is permitted to implement or continue Plans or the provisions  
of any agreement relating to such Plans from year-to-year only if, based on     
certain legal considerations, the Trustees are able to conclude that the Plans  
will benefit each affected Trust Portfolio and class. Absent such yearly        
determination, the Plans must be terminated as set forth above. In the event of 
the termination of the Plans for any reason, the provisions of this Schedule F  
relating to the Plans will also terminate. You agree that your selling          
agreements with persons or entities through whom you intend to distribute       
Contracts will provide that compensation paid to such persons or entities may be
reduced if a Portfolio's Plan is no longer effective or is no longer applicable 
to such Portfolio or class of shares available under the Contracts.             

Any obligation assumed by the Trust pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited 
in all cases to the assets of the Trust and no person shall seek satisfaction   
thereof from shareholders of the Trust. You agree to waive payment of any       
amounts payable to you by Underwriter under a Plan until such time as the       
Underwriter has received such fee from the Trust.                               

The provisions of the Plans shall control over the provisions of the            
Participation Agreement, including this Schedule F, in the event of any         
inconsistency.                                                                  

You agree to provide complete disclosure as required by all applicable statutes,
rules and regulations of all rule 12b-1 fees received from us in the prospectus

   Supplementary Information: The following is a summary of the application. The
complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference     
Branch, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549-0102 (tel. (202)         
942-8090).                                                                      

Applicants' Representations:                                              

1. Each of the Funds is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end      
management investment company and was organized as a Massachusetts business     
trust. The Templeton Trust currently consists of eight separate series, and the 
VIP Trust consists of twenty-five separate series. Each Fund's Declaration of   
Trust permits the Trustees to create additional series of shares at any time.   
The Funds currently serve as the underlying investment medium for variable      
annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by various        
insurance companies. The Funds have entered into investment management          
agreements with certain investment managers ("Investment Managers") directly or 
indirectly owned by Franklin Resources, Inc. ("Resources"), a publicly owned    
company engaged in the financial services industry through its subsidiaries.    

2. TFAC is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Resources. TFAC is the 
sole insurance company in the Franklin Templeton organization, and specializes  
in the writing of variable annuity contracts. The Templeton Trust has entered   
into a Fund Administration Agreement with Franklin Templeton Services, Inc. ("FT
Services"), which replaced TFAC in 1998 as administrator, and FT Services       
subcontracts certain services to TFAC. FT Services also serves as administrator 
to all series of the VIP Trust. TFAC and FT Services provide certain            
administrative facilities and services for the VIP and Templeton Trusts.        

3. On November 16, 1993, the Commission issued an order granting exemptive
relief to permit shares of the Templeton Trust to be sold to and held by        
variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of both          
affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies (Investment Company Act    
Release No. 19879, File No. 812-8546) (the "Original Order"). Applicants        
incorporate by reference into the application the Application for the Original  
Order and each amendment thereto, the Notice of Application for the Original    
Order, and the Original Order, to the extent necessary, to supplement the       
representations made in the application in support of the requested relief.     
Applicants represent that all of the facts asserted in the Application for the  
Original Order and any amendments thereto remain true and accurate in all       
material respects to the extent that such facts are relevant to any relief on   
which Applicants continue to rely. The Original Order allows the Templeton Trust
to offer its shares to insurance companies as the investment vehicle for their  
separate accounts supporting variable annuity contracts and variable life       
insurance contracts (collectively, the "Variable Contracts"). Applicants state  
that the Original Order does not (i) include the VIP Trust or Future Funds as   
parties, nor (ii) expressly address the sale of shares of the Funds or any      
Future Funds to qualified pension and retirement plans outside the separate     
account context including, without limitation, those trusts, plans, accounts,   
contracts or annuities described in Sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408(b),    
408(k), 414(d), 457(b), 501(c)(18) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as     
amended (the "Code"), and any other trust, plan, contract, account or annuity   
that is determined to be within the scope of Treasury Regulation                
1.817.5(f)(3)(iii) ("Qualified Plans").                                         

 4. Separate accounts owning shares of the Funds and their insurance company
depositors are referred to in the application as "Participating Separate        
Accounts" and "Participating Insurance Companies," respectively. The use of a   
common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for    
both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of a single 
insurance company (or of two or more affiliated insurance companies) is referred
to as "mixed funding." The use of a common management investment company as the 
underlying investment medium for variable annuity and/or variable life insurance
separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to as "shared 
funding."                                                                       

Applicants' Legal Analysis:                                               

  1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an amended order pursuant to
Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, adding the VIP Trust and Future Funds to the      
Original Order and exempting scheduled premium variable life insurance separate 
accounts and flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts of      
Participating Insurance Companies (and, to the extent necessary, any principal  
underwriter and depositor of such an account) and the Applicants from Sections  
9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and         
6e-3(T)(b)(15) (and any comparable rule) thereunder, respectively, to the extent
necessary to permit shares of the Funds and any Future Funds to be sold to and  
held by                                                                         

29

P-->EX-99.H.1530th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
Qualified Plans. Applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate
in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and        
consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
1940 Act.                                                                       

2. The Original Order does not include the VIP Trust or Future Funds as   
parties nor expressly address the sale of shares of the Funds or any Future     
Funds to Qualified Plans. Applicants propose that the VIP Trust and Future Funds
be added as parties to the Original Order and the Funds and any Future Funds be 
permitted to offer and sell their shares to Qualified Plans.                    

3. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in part, that the Commission, by
order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, 
security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or      
transactions from any provisions of the 1940 Act or the rules or regulations    
thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the  
purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.          

4. In connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life      
insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 
Act as a unit investment trust ("UIT"), Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial       
exemptions from various provisions of the 1940 Act, including the following: (1)
Section 9(a), which makes it unlawful for certain individuals to act in the     
capacity of employee, officer, or director for a UIT, by limiting the           
application of the eligibility restrictions in Section 9(a) to affiliated       
persons directly participating in the management of a registered management     
investment company; and (2) Sections 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to  
the extent that those sections might be deemed to require "pass-through" voting 
with respect to an underlying fund's shares, by allowing an insurance company to
disregard the voting instructions of contractowners in certain circumstances.   

5. These exemptions are available, however, only where the management     
investment company underlying the separate account (the "underlying fund")      
offers its shares "exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of  
the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company." Therefore, Rule 
6e-2 does not permit either mixed funding or shared funding because the relief  
granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium
variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund 
that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or a flexible premium variable
life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life   
insurance company. Rule 6e-2(b)(15) also does not permit the sale of shares of  
the underlying fund to Qualified Plans.                                         

6. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts  
issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a UIT, Rule  
6e-3(T)(b)(15) also provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a)
and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. These exemptions, however, are available only where  
the separate account's underlying fund offers its shares "exclusively to        
separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance      
company, offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or 
which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life 
insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company." Therefore, Rule 6e-3(T)    
permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding and also does not      
permit the sale of shares of the underlying fund to Qualified Plans. As noted   
above, the Original Order granted the Templeton Trust exemptive relief to permit
mixed and shared funding, but did not expressly address the sale of its shares  
to Qualified Plans.                                                             

7. Applicants note that if the Funds were to sell their shares only to    
Qualified Plans, exemptive relief under Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) would not be 
necessary. Applicants state that the relief provided for under Rule 6e-2(b)(15) 
and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) does not relate to qualified pension and retirement     
plans or to a registered investment company's ability to sell its shares to such
plans.                                                                          

8. Applicants state that changes in the federal tax law have created the  
opportunity for each of the Funds to increase its asset base through the sale of
its shares to Qualified Plans. Applicants state that Section 817(h) of the      
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), imposes certain         
diversification standards on the assets underlying Variable Contracts. Treasury 
Regulations generally require that, to meet the diversification requirements,   
all of the beneficial interests in the underlying investment company must be    
held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more life insurance companies.  
Notwithstanding this, Applicants note that the Treasury Regulations also contain
an exception to this requirement that permits trustees of a Qualified Plan to   
hold shares of an investment company, the shares of which are also held by      
insurance company segregated asset accounts, without adversely affecting the    
status of the investment                                                        

30

P-->EX-99.H.1531st�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
company as an adequately diversified underlying investment of Variable Contracts
issued through such segregated asset accounts (Treas. Reg. 1.817-5(f)(3)(iii)). 

9. Applicants state that the promulgation of Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and        
6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act preceded the issuance of these Treasury       
Regulations. Thus, Applicants assert that the sale of shares of the same        
investment company to both separate accounts and Qualified Plans was not        
contemplated at the time of the adoption of Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and               
6e-3(T)(b)(15).                                                                 

10. Section 9(a) provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as 
investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end          
investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a      
disqualification enumerated in Section 9(a)(1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and    
6e-3(T)(b)(15) provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances,
subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding. These exemptions limit  
the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or    
companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying         
portfolio investment company.                                                   

11. Applicants state that the relief granted in Rule 6e-2(b)(15) and      
6e-3(T)(b)(15) from the requirements of Section 9 limits, in effect, the amount 
of monitoring of an insurer's personnel that would otherwise be necessary to    
ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the   
policy and purposes of Section 9. Applicants submit that those Rules recognize  
that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly 
intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of
Section 9(a) to the many individuals involved in an insurance company complex,  
most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to        
investment companies funding the separate accounts.                             

   12. Applicants to the Original Order previously requested and received relief
from Section 9(a) and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) to the extent        
necessary to permit mixed and shared funding. Applicants maintain that the      
relief previously granted from Section 9(a) will in no way be affected by the   
proposed sale of shares of the Funds to Qualified Plans. Those individuals who  
participate in the management or administration of the Funds will remain the    
same regardless of which Qualified Plans use such Funds. Applicants maintain    
that more broadly applying the requirements of Section 9(a) because of          
investment by Qualified Plans would not serve any regulatory purpose. Moreover, 
Qualified Plans, unlike separate accounts, are not themselves investment        
companies and therefore are not subject to Section 9 of the 1940 Act.           

13. Applicants state that Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)  
provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirement with respect to     
several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared       
funding are observed. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)      
provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its 
contractowners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any     
contract between a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an
insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs         
(b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of the Rules). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and        
6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(2) provide that the insurance company may disregard      
contractowners' voting instructions if the contractowners initiate any change in
such company's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any investment    
adviser (provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and  
subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii)(B) and  
(C) of the Rules).                                                              

14. Applicants assert that Qualified Plans, which are not registered as   
investment companies under the 1940 Act, have no requirement to pass-through the
voting rights to plan participants. Applicants state that applicable law        
expressly reserves voting rights to certain specified persons. Under Section    
403(a) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), shares of a  
fund sold to a Qualified Plan must be held by the trustees of the Qualified     
Plan. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustee(s) must have exclusive      
authority and discretion to manage and control the Qualified Plan with two      
exceptions: (1) when the Qualified Plan expressly provides that the trustee(s)  
are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which
case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the  
terms of the Qualified Plan and not contrary to ERISA; and (2) when the         
authority to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of the Qualified Plan is      
delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of   
ERISA. Unless one of the two above exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, 
Qualified Plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for     
voting proxies. Where a named fiduciary to a Qualified Plan appoints an         
investment manager, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the   
shares held unless the right to vote such                                       

31

P-->EX-99.H.1532nd�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary. Where a Qualified    
Plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions,  
Applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of    
interest between or among variable contract holders and Qualified Plan investors
with respect to voting of the respective Fund's shares. Accordingly, Applicants 
state that, unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts, the issue 
of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is
not present with respect to such Qualified Plans since the Qualified Plans are  
not entitled to pass-through voting privileges.                                 

15. Even if a Qualified Plan were to hold a controlling interest in one of
the Funds, Applicants believe that such control would not disadvantage other    
investors in such Fund to any greater extent than is the case when any          
institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any      
open-end management investment company. In this regard, Applicants submit that  
investment in a Fund by a Qualified Plan will not create any of the voting      
complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding. Unlike mixed or    
shared funding, Qualified Plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by   
veto rights of insurers or state regulators.                                    

 16. Applicants state that some of the Qualified Plans, however, may provide
for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers), or another named       
fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from        
participants. Where a Qualified Plan provides participants with the right to    
give voting instructions, Applicants see no reason to believe that participants 
in Qualified Plans generally or those in a particular Qualified Plan, either as 
a single group or in combination with participants in other Qualified Plans,    
would vote in a manner that would disadvantage Variable Contract holders. In    
sum, Applicants maintain that the purchase of shares of the Funds by Qualified  
Plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not         
otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding.                                

17. Applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares of the Funds to 
Qualified Plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable         
conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors. In         
particular, Applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond that 
which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance
contractowners.                                                                 

18. As noted above, Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain            
diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable contracts held in
an underlying mutual fund. The Code provides that a variable contract shall not 
be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance, as applicable, for any     
period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments are not, in        
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department, adequately   
diversified.                                                                    

   19. Treasury Department Regulations issued under Section 817(h) provide that,
in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements, all of the         
beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated   
asset accounts of one or more insurance companies. However, the Regulations     
contain certain exceptions to this requirement, one of which allows shares in an
underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a qualified pension or     
retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the        
underlying fund also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in  
connection with their variable contracts (Treas. Reg. 1.817-5(f)(3)(iii)). Thus,
Applicants believe that the Treasury Regulations specifically permit "qualified 
pension or retirement plans" and separate accounts to invest in the same        
underlying fund. For this reason, Applicants have concluded that neither the    
Code nor the Treasury Regulations or revenue rulings thereunder presents any    
inherent conflict of interest.                                                  

 20. Applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which
distributions from Variable Contracts and Qualified Plans are taxed, these      
differences will have no impact on the Funds. When distributions are to be made,
and a Separate Account or Qualified Plan is unable to net purchase payments to  
make the distributions, the Separate Account and Qualified Plan will redeem     
shares of the Funds at their respective net asset value in conformity with Rule 
22c-1 under the 1940 Act (without the imposition of any sales charge) to provide
proceeds to meet distribution needs. A Qualified Plan will make distributions in
accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan.                                

  21. Applicants maintain that it is possible to provide an equitable means of
giving voting rights to Participating Separate Account contractowners and to    
Qualified Plans. In connection with any meeting of shareholders, the Funds will 
inform each shareholder, including each Participating Insurance Company and     
Qualified Plan, of information necessary for the meeting, including their       
respective share of ownership in the relevant Fund. Each Participating Insurance
Company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with Rules 6e-2 and 
6e-3(T), as applicable, and its participation agreement with the relevant Fund. 
Shares held by Qualified Plans will be voted in accordance with                 

32

P-->EX-99.H.1533rd�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
applicable law. The voting rights provided to Qualified Plans with respect to   
shares of the Funds would be no different from the voting rights that are       
provided to Qualified Plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general 
public.                                                                         

22. Applicants have concluded that even if there should arise issues with 
respect to a state insurance commissioner's veto powers over investment         
objectives where the interests of contractowners and the interests of Qualified 
Plans are in conflict, the issues can be almost immediately resolved since the  
trustees of (or participants in) the Qualified Plans can, on their own, redeem  
the shares out of the Funds. Applicants note that state insurance commissioners 
have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance        
companies usually cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund  
and invest in another. Generally, time-consuming, complex transactions must be  
undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers. Conversely, the        
trustees of Qualified Plans or the participants in participant-directed         
Qualified Plans can make the decision quickly and redeem their interest in the  
Funds and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory       
impediments faced by separate accounts or, as is the case with most Qualified   
Plans, even hold cash pending suitable investment.                              

23. Applicants also state that they do not see any greater potential for  
material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of participants 
under Qualified Plans and contractowners of Participating Separate Accounts from
possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exist   
between variable annuity contractowners and variable life insurance             
contractowners.                                                                 

  24. Applicants state that the sale of shares of the Funds to Qualified Plans
in addition to separate accounts of Participating Insurance Companies will      
result in an increased amount of assets available for investment by the Funds.  
This may benefit variable contractowners by promoting economies of scale, by    
permitting increased safety of investments through greater diversification, and 
by making the addition of new portfolios more feasible.                         

25. Applicants assert that, regardless of the type of shareholders in each
Fund, each Fund's Investment Manager is or would be contractually and otherwise 
obligated to manage the Fund solely and exclusively in accordance with that     
Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as well as any          
guidelines established by the Board of Trustees of such Fund (the "Board"). The 
Investment Manager works with a pool of money and (except in a few instances    
where this may be required in order to comply with state insurance laws) does   
not take into account the identity of the shareholders. Thus, each Fund will be 
managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund. Applicants therefore see no
significant legal impediment to permitting the sale of shares of the Funds to   
Qualified Plans.                                                                

26. Applicants state that the Commission has permitted the amendment of a 
substantially similar original order for the purpose of adding a party to the   
original order and has permitted open-end management investment companies to    
offer their shares directly to Qualified Plan in addition to separate accounts  
of affiliated or unaffiliated insurance companies which issue either or both    
variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance contracts. Applicants     
state that the amended order sought in the application is identical to precedent
with respect to the conditions Applicants propose should be imposed on Qualified
Plans in connection with investment in the Funds.                               

Applicants' Conditions:                                                   

If the requested amended order is granted, Applicants consent to the      
following conditions:                                                           

  1. A majority of the Board of each Fund shall consist of persons who are not
"interested persons" thereof, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act,   
and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the        
Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death,    
disqualification or bona fide resignation of any Board Member or Members, then  
the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) for a period of 45 days 
if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the remaining Board Members; (b)   
for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the       
vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may       
prescribe by order upon application.                                            

2. The Board will monitor their respective Fund for the existence of any  
material irreconcilable conflict among the interests of the Variable Contract   
owners of all Separate Accounts investing in the Funds and of the Qualified Plan
participants investing in the Funds. The Board will determine what action, if   
any, shall be taken in response to such conflicts. A material irreconcilable    
conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) an action by any    
state                                                                           

33

P-->EX-99.H.1534th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable federal or state     
insurance, tax or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private   
letter ruling, no-action or interpretive letter, or any similar action by       
insurance, tax or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or   
judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the       
investments of the Funds are being managed; (e) a difference in voting          
instructions given by variable annuity contract owners, variable life insurance 
contract owners, and trustees of Qualified Plans; (f) a decision by an insurer  
to disregard the voting instructions of Variable Contract owners; or (g) if     
applicable, a decision by a Qualified Plan to disregard the voting instructions 
of Qualified Plan participants.                                                 

3. Participating Insurance Companies, the Investment Managers, and any    
Qualified Plan that executes a fund participation agreement upon becoming an    
owner of 10 percent or more of the assets of an Fund (a "Participating Qualified
Plan"), will report any potential or existing conflicts of which it becomes     
aware to the Board of any relevant Fund. Participating Insurance Companies, the 
Investment Managers and the Participating Qualified Plans will be responsible   
for assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibilities under these        
conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for 
the Board to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is   
not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform 
the Board whenever voting instructions of Contract owners are disregarded and,  
if pass-through voting is applicable, an obligation by each Participating       
Qualified Plan to inform the Board whenever it has determined to disregard      
Qualified Plan participant voting instructions. The responsibility to report    
such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, will be contractual    
obligations of all Participating Insurance Companies investing in the Funds     
under their agreements governing participation in the Funds, and such agreements
shall provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only  
to the interests of the Variable Contract owners. The responsibility to report  
such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, will be contractual    
obligations of all Participating Qualified Plans under their agreements         
governing participation in the Funds, and such agreements will provide that     
their responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of 
Qualified Plan participants.                                                    

   4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board of a Fund, or by a majority
of the disinterested Board Members, that a material irreconcilable conflict     
exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies and Participating        
Qualified Plans will, at their own expense and to the extent reasonably         
practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested Board Members, take
whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable 
conflict, which steps could include: (a) in the case of Participating Insurance 
Companies, withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Separate      
Account s from the Fund or any portfolio thereof and reinvesting such assets in 
a different investment medium, including another portfolio of an Fund or another
Fund, or submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be       
implemented to a vote of all affected Variable Contract owners and, as          
appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., variable    
annuity contract owners or variable life insurance contract owners of one or    
more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation,
or offering to the affected Variable Contract owners the option of making such a
change; (b) in the case of Participating Qualified Plans, withdrawing the assets
allocable to some or all of the Qualified Plans from the Fund and reinvesting   
such assets in a different investment medium; and (c) establishing a new        
registered management investment company or managed Separate Account. If a      
material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating
Insurance Company to disregard Variable Contract owner voting instructions, and 
that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, 
then the insurer may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw the       
insurer's Separate Account investment in such Fund, and no charge or penalty    
will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. If a material irreconcilable    
conflict arises because of a Participating Qualified Plan's decision to         
disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and    
that decision represents minority position or would preclude a majority vote,   
the Participating Qualified Plan may be required, at the Fund's election, to    
withdraw its investment in such Fund, and no charge or penalty will be imposed  
as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in   
the event of a determination by a Board of a material irreconcilable conflict   
and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of
all Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans under   
their agreements governing participation in the Funds, and these                
responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interest of        
Variable Contract owners and Qualified Plan participants.                       

   5. For purposes of Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested Board Members
of the applicable Board will determine whether or not any proposed action       
adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but in no event will  
the relevant Fund or the Investment Managers be required to establish a new     
funding medium for any Contract. No Participating Insurance Company shall be    
required by Condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any Variable      

34

P-->EX-99.H.1535th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the   
Variable Contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material      
irreconcilable conflict. Further, no Participating Qualified Plan shall be      
required by Condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any Participating 
Qualified Plan if (a) a majority of Qualified Plan participants materially and  
adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such 
offer, or (b) pursuant to governing Qualified Plan documents and applicable law,
the Participating Qualified Plan makes such decision without a Qualified Plan   
participant vote.                                                               

6. The determination of the Board of the existence of a material          
irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing      
promptly to all Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified   
Plans.                                                                          

7. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting     
privileges to Variable Contract owners who invest in registered Separate        
Accounts so long as and to the extent that the Commission continues to interpret
the 1940 Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for Variable Contract  
owners. As to Variable Contracts issued by unregistered Separate Accounts,      
pass-through voting privileges will be extended to participants to the extent   
granted by issuing insurance companies. Each Participating Insurance Company    
will also vote shares of the Funds held in its Separate Accounts for which no   
voting instructions from Contract owners are timely received, as well as shares 
of the Funds which the Participating Insurance Company itself owns, in the same 
proportion as those shares of the Funds for which voting instructions from      
contract owners are timely received. Participating Insurance Companies will be  
responsible for assuring that each of their registered Separate Accounts        
participating in the Funds calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent  
with other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting
privileges in a manner consistent with all other registered Separate Accounts   
investing in the Funds will be a contractual obligation of all Participating    
Insurance Companies under their agreements governing their participation in the 
Funds. Each Participating Qualified Plan will vote as required by applicable law
and governing Qualified Plan documents.                                         

  8. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by the Board of a
Fund and all action by such Board with regard to determining the existence of a 
conflict, notifying Participating Insurance Companies and Participating         
Qualified Plans of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action      
adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the 
meetings of such Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other  
records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.                 

  9. Each Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that separate
disclosure in their respective Separate Account prospectuses may be appropriate 
to advise accounts regarding the potential risks of mixed and shared funding.   
Each Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that (a) the Fund is intended to be a
funding vehicle for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts      
offered by various insurance companies and for qualified pension and retirement 
plans; (b) due to differences of tax treatment and other considerations, the    
interests of various Contract owners participating in the Fund and/or the       
interests of Qualified Plans investing in the Fund may at some time be in       
conflict; and (c) the Board of such Fund will monitor events in order to        
identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine
what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such conflict.          

10. Each Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring   
voting by shareholders (which, for these purposes, will be the persons having a 
voting interest in the shares of the Funds), and, in particular, the Funds will 
either provide for annual shareholder meetings (except insofar as the Commission
may interpret Section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply
with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act, although the Funds are not the type of trust
described in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act, as well as with Section 16(a) of the
1940 Act and, if and when applicable, Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further,   
each Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the    
requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of Board       
Members and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect      
thereto.                                                                        

   11. If and to the extent Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act is amended,
or proposed Rule 6e-3 under the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief
from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules promulgated thereunder, with    
respect to mixed or shared funding on terms and conditions materially different 
from any exemptions granted in the order requested in the application, then the 
Funds and/or Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified      
Plans, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with 
such Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), as amended, or proposed Rule 6e-3, as adopted, to  
the extent that such Rules are applicable.                                      

35

P-->EX-99.H.1536th�Page�of�37TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
 12. The Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans
and/or the Investment Managers, at least annually, will submit to the Board such
reports, materials or data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Board
may fully carry out obligations imposed upon it by the conditions contained in  
the application. Such reports, materials and data will be submitted more        
frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations of the           
Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans to provide  
these reports, materials and data to the Board, when the Board so reasonably    
requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance      
Companies and Participating Qualified Plans under their agreements governing    
participation in the Funds.                                                     

   13. If a Qualified Plan should ever become a holder of ten percent or more of
the assets of a Fund, such Qualified Plan will execute a participation agreement
with the Fund that includes the conditions set forth herein to the extent       
applicable. A Qualified Plan will execute an application containing an          
acknowledgment of this condition upon such Qualified Plan's initial purchase of 
the shares of any Fund.                                                         

Conclusion:                                                               

Applicants assert that, for the reasons summarized above, the requested   
exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the       
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and      
provisions of the 1940 Act.                                                     

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to 
delegated authority.

 Templeton Variable Products Series Fund, et al.

File No. 812-11698

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Release No. IC-24079

 1999 SEC LEXIS 2177
October 13, 1999

ACTION:  Order Granting Exemptions                                              

TEXT: Templeton Variable Products Series Fund ("Templeton Trust"), Franklin     
Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust ("VIP Trust"), Templeton Funds      
Annuity Company ("TFAC") or any successor to TFAC, and any future open-end      
investment company for which TFAC or any affiliate is the administrator,        
sub-administrator, investment manager, adviser, principal underwriter, or       
sponsor ("Future Funds") filed an application on July 14, 1999, and an amendment
on September 17, 1999 seeking an amended order of the Commission pursuant to    
Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") exempting them  
from the provisions of Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and
Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15). The prior order (Rel. No. IC-19879)       
granted exemptive relief to permit shares of the Templeton Trust to be sold to  
and held by variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of   
both affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies. The proposed relief  
would amend the prior order to add as parties to that order the VIP Trust and   
any Future Funds and to permit shares of the Templeton Trust, the VIP Trust, and
Future Funds to be issued to and held by qualified pension and retirement plans 
outside the separate account context.                                           

A notice of the filing of the application was issued on September 17, 1999
(Rel. No. IC-24018). The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to       
request a hearing and stated that an order granting the application would be    
issued unless a hearing should be ordered. No request for a hearing has been    
filed, and the Commission has not ordered a hearing.                            

 The matter has been considered, and it is found that granting the requested
exemptions is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the        
protection of investors and the purposes intended by the policy and provisions  
of the 1940 Act.                                                                

Accordingly,                                                              

 IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, that the requested
exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules
6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, be, and hereby are, granted,         
effective forthwith.                                                            

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to

 NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION
 RIDER
 INSURANCE EXCHANGE (IE)

1.     WHAT IS YOUR BENEFIT? On or after the first policy anniversary and while 
      this rider is in force, you may exchange this policy for a new policy on
     the life of another person in whom you have an insurable interest. This
  person will be the new Insured under the new policy, if he or she is
acceptable under our then current issue rules.                    

    You may want to consult with your tax advisor, prior to exercising the
exchange option provided under this rider.                        

2.     WHAT IS THE DATE OF EXCHANGE? The date of exchange will be the Monthly   
     Deduction Day of this policy, which is on or next following the date on
which we have received all of the following at our Home Office:   

  1)     The application for the new policy, signed by you and the new
Insured;                                            
2)     this policy;                                               
     3)     proof, acceptable to us, of the insurability of the person to be
Insured;                                            
4)     proof of your insurable interest in that person;           
5)     any loan repayment, as required by Item 7 of this rider;   
      6)     any extra payment we may require in connection with the exchange,
as required by Item 6 of this rider.                

      On the date of exchange, the new policy will take effect and this policy
     will become void. No insurance will be provided under this policy on or
     after that date. If an assignment is in effect under this policy on the
 date of exchange, we shall require that the assignee give a written
consent to the exchange.                                          

3.     WHAT TYPE OF INSURANCE WILL THE NEW POLICY PROVIDE? The new policy will  
       provide the same type of insurance as this policy. The new policy will be
     the same edition, and will have the same provisions and limitations, as
 policies we are issuing on the date of exchange. If, on the date of
   exchange, we are no longer offering a policy which is similar to this
  policy, then the new policy will be another policy which we are then
making available for these types of exchanges.                    

   The face amount of the new policy cannot exceed the lesser of (1) the
    initial face amount of this policy when it was issued, or (2) the face
     amount of this policy on the date of exchange. Riders may not be made a
part of the new policy, unless we agree.                          

      The policy date of the new policy will be the date of exchange. The cost
of insurance charges for the new policy will be based on the new  
      Insured's age, sex and class of risk on the date of exchange, as well as
our cost of insurance rate scale in effect at that time.

 INSURANCE EXCHANGE (IE)
 (CONTINUED)
4.     WHEN DO THE INCONTESTABILITY AND SUICIDE EXCLUSION PERIODS BEGIN FOR THE 
  NEW POLICY? The periods of time described in the Incontestability or
      Suicide Exclusion provisions of the new policy will be measured from the
date of issue of the new policy.                                  

5.     WHEN DOES THE SURRENDER CHARGE PERIOD BEGIN FOR THE NEW POLICY? The      
    period during which the surrender charges, if any, apply under the new
policy will be measured from the policy date of this policy.      

6.     HOW DO WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF ANY REQUIRED EXTRA PAYMENT? The cash   
       value of the new policy will be the same as the cash value of this policy
   on the date of exchange. However, the cash surrender value of the new
     policy may be different than that of this policy if different surrender
    charges are applicable to the new Insured. At the time the exchange is
     requested, we may require an extra payment to be paid no later than the
       date of exchange. The method we use to determine this extra payment is as
follows:                                                          

       a)     If the cash surrender value of the new policy will exceed the cash
           surrender value of this policy, then a payment equal to 103% of
the difference between these two values is required.

  b)     It may happen that the cash surrender value of the new policy
              after the exchange would be zero or less than zero. In this event,
             we will require a payment in an amount sufficient to keep the new
        policy in force for 2 months following the date of exchange.

7.     WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS POLICY HAS AN UNPAID LOAN? Loans on this policy     
 cannot be carried over to the new policy. If you have not repaid an
       outstanding loan before the date of exchange, the amount of the loan will
be deducted from the cash value before the exchange takes place.  

8.     DOES THIS RIDER HAVE CASH OR LOAN VALUES? This rider does not have cash  
value or loan value.                                              

9.     IS THERE A CHARGE FOR THIS RIDER? There is no charge for this rider.     

10.    IS THIS RIDER PART OF THE CONTRACT? This rider is made a part of the     
policy to which it is attached.                                   

11.    WHEN DOES THIS RIDER END? You can cancel this rider by sending us your   
   signed notice. This rider ends at the death of the Insured or if this
policy ends or is surrendered.                                    

     This rider will also end when the right to exchange this policy for one
      on the life of a new Insured is exercised in accordance with the rider's
provisions.

New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual insurance company, which means it is not publicly traded and has no shareholders. Instead, its policy owners are the ones who share in ownership rights of the company. With a mutual company, clients who purchase participating products are entitled to vote in the board of directors elections and are eligible to share in annual dividends that are declared. The company's priority is to safeguard their interests. Policies issued by our subsidiary companies are not participating and do not share in these rights.
Figure encompasses all policy owners of New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC) and its insurance company subsidiaries. New York Life's company strength is based on several factors, including insurance in force. 
Figures reflect the consolidated results of NYLIC and its insurance subsidiaries presented on a statutory basis. Benefits paid primarily include death claims paid to beneficiaries and annuity payments. It also includes dividends paid to eligible policyholders. For more a more complete breakdown of this data, please see our Report to Policyholders.
**** While New York Life has historically paid a dividend on its participating policies, dividends on its participating policies are not guaranteed.

Note: All figures are as of Dec. 31 2015.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.

Annuities Overview

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
