NEW YORK, Aug. 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Committee to Rescue Reed's ("The Committee") announced today that it has formally nominated five highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Reed's, Inc. (NYSE MKT: REED) ("Reed's" or the "Company") board of directors (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2016 annual meeting.
The Committee issued the following statement regarding the need for change at Reed's:








"Since going public, Reed's has been plagued by poor financial performance and serious corporate governance deficiencies.  For evidence of these serious corporate governance deficiencies, shareholders need to look no further than the following set of troubling facts: (i) two of the four current members of the Board include the Chairman and CEO and his spouse, (ii) one of the independent directors has been cited by Institutional Shareholder Services for his failure 'to attend at least 75 percent of his board and committee meetings since 2009', (iii) the Board has allowed the other current independent director to serve despite his failure to receive majority vote support at the last two annual meetings and (iv) Reed's received notice from the New York Stock Exchange for its failure to meet the standards for continued listing."
"In recent months, members of The Committee have made multiple attempts to engage in good faith dialogue with Chairman and CEO Chris Reed in order to avoid a potentially costly and time consuming proxy contest.  Unfortunately, their efforts were met with deafening silence from Mr. Reed.  The Committee is concerned that the Company's exceptionally poor operating performance will continue to deteriorate and that each shareholder's investment runs the risk of being entirely destroyed unless new, independent voices are added in the boardroom."
"The Committee had hoped to work constructively with the Board to address its concerns.  Unfortunately, it is as if Reed's does not have a functioning Board to engage with.  Additionally, Mr. Reed has been entirely unresponsive to date.  These circumstances have left us with no choice but to nominate a slate of highly qualified and independent candidates with the relevant skill sets required to address the Company's serious shortcomings.  The Committee has nominated Jeffrey T. Glidden, Jeffrey V. Hembrock, Edwin R. Lozano, James G. McRitchie and Matthew D. Tekulsky, who are committed to dramatically improving Reed's operating performance and instituting best in class governance practices at Reed's."
The Committee's nominees are:

Jeffrey T. Glidden – twenty-five years of experience in global operations, supply chain optimization, and general management with expertise in the consumer foods and beverages industry. 
Jeffrey V. Hembrock – over 38 years of experience in the brewing industry holding numerous senior executive positions at Miller Brewing Company. 
Edwin R. Lozano – over 25 years of experience in sales, marketing and general management with expertise in the consumer foods and beverages industry. 
James G. McRitchie – highly regarded expert in corporate governance with a long-standing dedication to shareholder advocacy. 
Matthew D. Tekulsky – long-term investor in Reed's with substantial financial expertise with an emphasis in the consumer foods and beverages industry.

NEW YORK, Aug. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- An investor group led by Edwin R. Lozano, which collectively owns approximately 2.7% of outstanding shares in Reed's, Inc. (AMEX:    REED) ("Reed's" or the "Company"), announced today that it has formed The Committee to Rescue Reed's ("The Committee") and has delivered a letter to the Chairman and CEO and the Board of Directors of Reed's highlighting the Company's poor financial performance and serious corporate governance deficiencies.  The Committee is extremely disappointed that Chairman and CEO Chris Reed has rebuffed recent attempts by Mr. Lozano to engage in a dialogue regarding his serious concerns and is preparing to nominate a slate of highly qualified candidates for election to the Reed's Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting.








The Committee has retained Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP as its legal and strategic advisor in connection with its investment and involvement at Reed's.
The full text of the letter follows:
THE COMMITTEE TO RESCUE REED'S
August 18, 2016
VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL
Reed's, Inc. 13000 South Spring Street Los Angeles, California  90061 Attn: Christopher J. Reed, Chairman and CEO 
cc:  Board of Directors
Dear Chris,
The Committee to Rescue Reed's ("The Committee") is a group of well-informed, long-term investors who collectively own a significant stake in Reed's, Inc. ("Reed's" or the "Company").  We have grown increasingly frustrated by the shortcomings in the Company's operational strategy and financial performance, as well as its weak governance oversight and practices.  In our opinion, these factors are key contributors to Reed's lackluster stock price performance over the past several years.  We have attempted to engage constructively with you in good-faith, but our serious concerns have unfortunately fallen on deaf ears.  You have therefore left us with little choice but to go public with our concerns.
We believe that the Board has failed to demonstrate a shareholder-focused mindset, has failed to hold management or itself accountable, and has failed to place the best interests of its shareholders ahead of the personal interests of insiders. As significant shareholders, our objective is to see the full value of our shares and the shares of all other owners of this Company be recognized in the marketplace.  We are committed to working on behalf of all shareholders to ensure that shareholders' interests are represented in the boardroom.  To this end, we fully intend to nominate a slate of highly qualified candidates for election to the Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting.
Remarkably, it has been more than a decade since the Board has seated a new member.  Certainly, this Board would benefit from thoughtful refreshment.  More specifically, what is needed are members who have greater industry expertise and proven business acumen.  A shareholder-focused mindset has simply been lacking on this Board for too long.  The Company's 2015 Proxy states, "We intend to maintain at least three independent directors on our Board of Directors at all times in the future."  Yet, since the sudden resignation of Mark Harris on June 1, 2016, the Board has failed to maintain a majority of independent directors as required under NYSE MKT listing rules.
We are not the only ones who have voiced serious concerns with the corporate governance practices at Reed's.  Notably, Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") recommended that shareholders withhold votes on each and every Reed's Board member at the 2015 Annual Meeting and stated the following in its 2015 Report:
"ISS has highlighted several problematic governance issues at the company in recent years, including repricing of options without prior shareholder approval, eliminating shareholders' right to call special meetings without prior shareholder ratification, and a director with chronic poor attendance at board and committee meetings. A history of governance issues heightens the concern that the board is not being accountable to shareholders."
Noted shareholder advocate James McRitchie has also recently called into serious question the corporate governance practices at Reed's on his popular corporate governance portal, CorpGov.Net.
The Committee has grave concerns regarding the following severe governance and operational deficiencies at Reed's:

Poor Share Price Performance.  Since the start of 2016, the Company's price per share has fallen approximately 51%, compared to an increase of approximately 9% for the S&P 500 Index.  Since going public, the Company's price per share has fallen approximately 34%, compared to an increase of approximately 54% for the S&P 500 Index. 
Poor Financial Performance.  Since going public, the Company has never had a profitable fiscal year.  Additionally, Reed's debt levels have ballooned to the point where debt makes up over 25% of the Company's enterprise value.  These high debt levels coupled with the Company's weak cash flows and lack of profitability has necessitated that the Company undertake multiple capital raises, which has led to ongoing shareholder dilution. 
Poor Executive Compensation Practices.  The 2015 Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan permits the repricing and cash buyout of awards without prior shareholder approval. The Company repriced outstanding stock options via a reduction of exercise price.  The repricing of outstanding stock options led ISS to recommend a withhold vote for all members of the Compensation Committee at the 2015 Annual Meeting. 
Independence of Directors.  The Company is in the rare position of having spouses serving on the Board together.  In light of the unfilled Board vacancy created this past June by the sudden resignation of Mark Harris, there are only four directors currently on the Board.  Consequently, only half of the Board is independent, which, even more disturbingly, means that half of the Board is presently husband and wife. This governance structure fails to provide the appropriate checks and balances needed between the Board and management, which, in turn, engenders the market to have the harmful and value-destroying perception of a general lack of accountability on the part of the Board. 
Absent Director.  Michael Fischman has been essentially missing in action from his duties as a director.  His absences have not gone unnoticed by ISS, which recommended a withhold vote on Mr. Fischman in 2014.  ISS noted in their 2014 report on Reed's that Mr. Fischman "has failed to attend at least 75 percent of his board and committee meetings since 2009." 
Quality of Directors.  In addition to Mr. Fischman's absenteeism, there are doubts as to whether certain directors have the requisite, specific industry expertise to properly oversee the Company and put it on the right path towards enhancing shareholder value.  We also have concerns regarding the lack of meaningful share ownership by the independent directors. 
Notice of Delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.  To add insult to injury, on June 22, 2016, the Company received notice from the New York Stock Exchange for failure to meet standards for continued listing.
We are extremely disappointed by your apparent dismissal of the serious concerns we have raised.  We continue to welcome an open dialogue with you, but to date you have demonstrated no interest in engaging constructively with us.  Our sincere hope is that the Board will take a fresh look at the opinions we have outlined above and take immediate action to work with us in embracing change rather than engage in a protracted and costly proxy contest in an effort to preserve the troubling status quo. Please know, however, that we are making the necessary preparations to nominate a slate of highly qualified candidates for election to the Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting.
We remain open to speaking with you at any time.
Respectfully yours,
Edwin R. Lozano

	   Lab Grown Diamond  - Lab grown diamonds, or lab created diamonds, display the same physical, chemical, and optical characteristics as natural diamonds, but are more environmentally friendly because they are grown in a lab. Created by duplicating the conditions under which diamonds naturally develop, lab grown diamonds are nearly impossible to differentiate from natural diamonds and are subject to the same grading credentials as mined diamonds, such as cut, color, and clarity. Lab created diamonds available for purchase should always come with a gem certification identifying them as laboratory grown.

(NYSE MKT: REED) ("Reed's" or the "Company").The Committee issued the following statement:"For the past several weeks, we have been working with Chris Reed to see if we could arrive at a mutually agreeable Board slate to avoid a costly and protracted proxy contest at the upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting.  We are appreciative of the efforts of two significant shareholders in mediating this process, Joseph Grace and David Robinov, both of whom previously served as members on the Reed's Board.  Both the Committee and Mr. Reed encouraged and fully supported a process whereby Messrs. Grace and Robinov were to interview and properly vet candidates put forth by each party and to, on the basis of the aforementioned vetting process, recommend a qualified, unified slate of Board nominees. While the independent mediators contacted, interviewed and quickly vetted all five candidates put forth by the Committee, Mr. Reed failed to provide the names and contact information for the Company's recommended nominees.""Mr. Reed did, however, volunteer the name of Bruce Nierenberg for inclusion as a possible Board nominee. Messrs. Grace and Robinov were successful in their efforts to contact, interview, and vet Mr. Nierenberg. Further, according to a recent BevNET article, Mr. Reed also announced the possibility of John Bello joining the Board, but Mr. Bello reportedly refused to be vetted by the independent mediators.  After numerous requests to Mr. Reed and missed milestones regarding delivery of the Board's proposed nominees, the mediators submitted a seven-member Board recommendation consisting of the Committee's five nominees along with Bruce Nierenberg and Mr. Reed. This recommendation was, unfortunately, ignored and the settlement discussions have ceased as of October 6th.  Consequently, the Committee continues preparations for a proxy contest at the upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting.""Despite the recent setback, the Committee remains hopeful that an expanded, mutually agreeable slate of nominees will ultimately be agreed upon by the parties. It is the sincere desire of the Committee to avoid a long and potentially destructive proxy contest. However, chances for arriving at such a unified slate are quickly dissipating, as filing deadlines loom.""The Committee has had discussions with several significant shareholders of Reed's, all of whom share our serious concerns regarding the Company's poor financial performance and serious corporate governance deficiencies.  We encourage any Reed's shareholders who may share our concerns to contact us at the numbers listed below.

Committee to Rescue Reed’s: Proxy Vote 
James McRitchie, November 16, 2016 , 

Committee to Rescue Reed’s Declares Victory
The Committee to Rescue Reed’s declares victory and states how members intend to vote their proxies. With the annual meeting now set for November 29, I will post a more detailed analysis of the proxy by tomorrow. I have already received a number of inquiries from those asking how I will vote. Advice to me? Use the comment box below.
The Committee to Rescue Reed’s Announces That It Has Completed Its Near-Term Objectives at Reed’s and Is Therefore Withdrawing Its Board Nominees and Proxy Contest
Gratified That its Involvement Led to a Reconstituted Board with Four New Independent Directors
Rescue Reed’s Members State Their Intention to Vote Against Chairman & CEO Chris Reed for Failing to Work in Good Faith with the Committee to Appoint Shareholder Nominees to the Board 
Rescue Members Intend to Remain Vigilant in Monitoring the Performance of the Company, its CEO and New Directors
NEW YORK, November 16, 2016 — The Committee to Rescue Reed’s (“Rescue Reed’s”), a group of concerned shareholders of Reed’s, Inc. (NYSE MKT:REED) (“Reed’s” or the “Company”), announced today that it has withdrawn its nomination of director candidates and proxy contest at the upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders after achieving virtually all of its near-term objectives for the Company, including a reconstituted Board with four new independent directors. Rescue Reed’s grew concerned in recent weeks that a proxy contest could have unintended consequences on the tenuous financials of the Company and had grown wary of the Company’s incumbent-favoring majority vote standard for contested elections.
Rescue Reed’s issued the following statement:
As a direct result of the steadfast efforts of The Committee, the Company has not only put forth four new independent Board nominees who seem to have the requisite industry, governance and financial expertise to properly oversee the Company, but has also finally separated the Chairman and CEO roles. While the Committee is grateful that the Company finally took the steps to enhance the composition of its Board, it remains disappointed, though not surprised, that CEO Chris Reed failed to appoint shareholder representatives to the Board, as agreed in principle a month ago. Nevertheless, The Committee believes its actions and recommendations are not only in the best interests of the Company but also of shareholders as evidenced by the 69% increase in the stock price to-date since the Committee formally engaged the Company on August 2, 2016.
With respect to voting on the proposals at the upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the members of Rescue Reed’s intend to vote their shares as follows:

Proposal 1: WITHHOLD votes against Christopher J. Reed for failing to work in good faith with The Committee to appoint shareholder representatives to the Board.
Proposal 2: Vote AGAINST the auditor. After seven years, it is time the Company engaged a new auditor.
Proposal 3: Vote FOR the say-on-pay vote.
Proposal 4: Vote AGAINST re-pricing of previously issued stock options. Performance goals were not met. Re-pricing options would simply reward failure. Stockholders do not get the benefit of re-priced shares, why should employees?
Proposal 5: Vote FOR the bylaw amendment requiring Directors to resign if they fail to receive the required vote for re-election. There should be no “zombie” Directors.
Proposal 6: Vote FOR the shareholder proposal to require an independent Chairman. The Chairman should be separate from the CEO to ensure greater oversight and accountability.
Proposal 7: Vote FOR the shareholder proposal on proxy access. Allowing long-term shareholders to add up to two nominees to the corporate proxy will enhance the Board’s accountability to shareholders.”

Rescue Reed’s concluded,
It is our hope that the newly constituted Board will be fully committed to representing the best interests of stockholders. We continue to be convinced that the Company has good products and can continue to grow with competent operational leadership and functional corporate governance. This has been sorely lacking under Chris Reed’s tenure as CEO for the past 28 years and simply cannot continue. We will remain vigilant in monitoring what we hope will be a successful transformation from historically poor performance to enhancement of shareholder value under improved governance and leadership.

(NYSE MKT: REED) ("Reed's" or the "Company"), announced today that it has withdrawn its nomination of director candidates and proxy contest at the upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders after achieving virtually all of its near-term objectives for the Company, including a reconstituted Board with four new independent directors. The Committee grew concerned in recent weeks that a proxy contest could have unintended consequences on the tenuous financials of the Company and had grown wary of the Company's incumbent-favoring majority vote standard for contested elections. The Committee issued the following statement:"As a direct result of the steadfast efforts of The Committee, the Company has not only put forth four new independent Board nominees who seem to have the requisite industry, governance and financial expertise to properly oversee the Company, but has also finally separated the Chairman and CEO roles.
