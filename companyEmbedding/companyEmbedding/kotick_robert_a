Career





This article needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2017)


Early career
Kotick began his career in 1983 while he was still in college at the University of Michigan,[4][5] when he began creating software for the Apple II with financial backing from Steve Wynn.[6] Kotick credits Steve Jobs for advising him to drop out of college to pursue his entrepreneurial interests in the software business.[7]
In 1987, he tried to acquire Commodore International. He planned to remove the keyboard and disk drive from the Amiga 500 and turn it into the first 16 bit video game system. He was unsuccessful in persuading Commodore's then-Chairman Irving Gould to sell control of the company.[4][5] He subsequently purchased a controlling stake in Leisure Concepts, Nintendo's licensing agent,[5] which was renamed 4Kids Entertainment.[1]
Kotick and his partner Brian Kelly bought a 25% stake in Activision in December 1990,[4][5] and became CEO in February 1991.[1] Kotick also served as a founder of International Consumer Technologies and was President from 1986 to January 1995. In 1995, International Consumer Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision.[8]
Work with Activision Blizzard
At Activision, Kotick set out to build "an institutional quality, well managed company with a focus on the independent developer."[5] In a 14 June 2010 interview with gaming blog Kotaku, Kotick stated, "…[P]art of the whole philosophy of Activision was whether you're owned outright or not, if you're a studio you have control of your destiny, you could make decisions about who to hire, flexibility on what products to make, how to make them, schedules appropriate to make them, budgets."[6]
Kotick engineered the Activision Blizzard merge, and stockholders of Activision Blizzard approved Kotick as CEO of the combined company on 9 July 2008.[9] In 2009, as reported by Forbes magazine, Robert Kotick received approximately $3.2 million USD in salary, benefits, options and incentives for his work with Activision Blizzard, of which $953,654 was his actual salary.[1] By 2013, Kotick was the second highest compensated CEO in the United States, earning $64.9 million USD, mostly in stock.[10]
Kotick has used Activision Blizzard's industry position to push partners for changes that he maintains would benefit the gaming community. In July 2009, Kotick threatened to stop making games for the PlayStation 3 platform if Sony did not cut the price of the console.[11] Kotick also urged the British government to reward Activision for continuing to invest in the country's pool of game developers by providing Activision with the same kinds of tax incentives provided by Canada, Singapore and eastern bloc countries.[12] Kotick has launched an Independent Games Competition with $500,000 in total available prize money for small developers working with new platforms and has stated that "keeping passion in game development is something that's important to him."[4][13]
In October 2009, under Kotick’s direction, Activision Blizzard launched Call of Duty Endowment, a non-profit public benefit corporation, which helps soldiers transition to civilian careers after their military service, with a commitment to create thousands of jobs for veterans including those returning from the Middle East. Kotick recruited an advisory board composed of veterans representing the various service branches.[14]
Recent
In October 2016, Kotick confirmed the creation of Activision Blizzard's Overwatch League.[15]
In 2016 November, Activision Blizzard inked a deal with Kotick where he might receive bonuses if certain financial benchmarks were met concerning M&A. Earlier that that year, Activision had acquired companies such as King Digital Ent and Major League Gaming.[16]
Boards of Directors
Kotick was also a Yahoo! board member from March 2003 to August 2008,[1][17][18] and is currently a board member for the Center for Early Education, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Tony Hawk Foundation.[1]
Controversy
Gaming press

Kotick has at times been a controversial figure in the gaming community.[6] In part this can be attributed to advocating a business strategy focused on only developing intellectual property which can be, in his words, "exploited" over a long period, to the exclusion of new titles which cannot guarantee sequels.[19] In responding to why Activision Blizzard chose not to publish certain games following the Activision/Blizzard merger, he stated that focusing on franchises that "have the potential to be exploited every year on every platform with clear sequel potential and have the potential to become $100 million franchises" has "worked very well for Activision Blizzard". Kotick described this business strategy as "narrow and deep" or "annualizable" and cited it as key to attracting development talent who may not be drawn to "speculative franchises".[20] Kotick also created a stir when commenting on Activision Blizzard's peripheral-driven franchises. During Activision Blizzard's Q2 2009 financial results conference, Kotick was challenged over his "comfort level" around high prices attached to "new games that have some expensive controllers" and said, "if it was left to me, I would raise the prices even further."[21] While Spong took the comment at face value,[22] Gamesindustry.biz thought the comment was a joke, but could be seen as "insensitive at a time when consumers are likely to be feeling the economic pinch".[23]
A frequent complaint from the gaming press is the gap between Kotick and Activision's chief consumers. Ars Technica editor Ben Kuchera wrote, "Kotick doesn't play his games, and it shows."[19] Video game developer Tim Schafer said Kotick "doesn't have to be as much of a dick" in his attitude towards Activision's customers.[24] Gaming blog Kotaku reported, however, that Kotick confessed to a passion for video games that "has never really gone away," and "rattle[d] off an impressive list of consoles he's owned in the past and games he loved."[6]
Personal life
A native of Long Island, New York, Kotick resides in California with his family.[25] He divorced his wife in late 2012.[26] He had a cameo role in the 2011 film Moneyball.[27]

Career





This article needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2017)


Early career
Kotick began his career in 1983 while he was still in college at the University of Michigan,[4][5] when he began creating software for the Apple II with financial backing from Steve Wynn.[6] Kotick credits Steve Jobs for advising him to drop out of college to pursue his entrepreneurial interests in the software business.[7]
In 1987, he tried to acquire Commodore International. He planned to remove the keyboard and disk drive from the Amiga 500 and turn it into the first 16 bit video game system. He was unsuccessful in persuading Commodore's then-Chairman Irving Gould to sell control of the company.[4][5] He subsequently purchased a controlling stake in Leisure Concepts, Nintendo's licensing agent,[5] which was renamed 4Kids Entertainment.[1]
Kotick and his partner Brian Kelly bought a 25% stake in Activision in December 1990,[4][5] and became CEO in February 1991.[1] Kotick also served as a founder of International Consumer Technologies and was President from 1986 to January 1995. In 1995, International Consumer Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision.[8]
Work with Activision Blizzard
At Activision, Kotick set out to build "an institutional quality, well managed company with a focus on the independent developer."[5] In a 14 June 2010 interview with gaming blog Kotaku, Kotick stated, "…[P]art of the whole philosophy of Activision was whether you're owned outright or not, if you're a studio you have control of your destiny, you could make decisions about who to hire, flexibility on what products to make, how to make them, schedules appropriate to make them, budgets."[6]
Kotick engineered the Activision Blizzard merge, and stockholders of Activision Blizzard approved Kotick as CEO of the combined company on 9 July 2008.[9] In 2009, as reported by Forbes magazine, Robert Kotick received approximately $3.2 million USD in salary, benefits, options and incentives for his work with Activision Blizzard, of which $953,654 was his actual salary.[1] By 2013, Kotick was the second highest compensated CEO in the United States, earning $64.9 million USD, mostly in stock.[10]
Kotick has used Activision Blizzard's industry position to push partners for changes that he maintains would benefit the gaming community. In July 2009, Kotick threatened to stop making games for the PlayStation 3 platform if Sony did not cut the price of the console.[11] Kotick also urged the British government to reward Activision for continuing to invest in the country's pool of game developers by providing Activision with the same kinds of tax incentives provided by Canada, Singapore and eastern bloc countries.[12] Kotick has launched an Independent Games Competition with $500,000 in total available prize money for small developers working with new platforms and has stated that "keeping passion in game development is something that's important to him."[4][13]
In October 2009, under Kotick’s direction, Activision Blizzard launched Call of Duty Endowment, a non-profit public benefit corporation, which helps soldiers transition to civilian careers after their military service, with a commitment to create thousands of jobs for veterans including those returning from the Middle East. Kotick recruited an advisory board composed of veterans representing the various service branches.[14]
Recent
In October 2016, Kotick confirmed the creation of Activision Blizzard's Overwatch League.[15]
In 2016 November, Activision Blizzard inked a deal with Kotick where he might receive bonuses if certain financial benchmarks were met concerning M&A. Earlier that that year, Activision had acquired companies such as King Digital Ent and Major League Gaming.[16]
Boards of Directors
Kotick was also a Yahoo! board member from March 2003 to August 2008,[1][17][18] and is currently a board member for the Center for Early Education, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Tony Hawk Foundation.[1]
Controversy
Gaming press





Some of this article's listed sources may not be reliable. Please help this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged or deleted. (July 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Kotick has at times been a controversial figure in the gaming community.[6] In part this can be attributed to advocating a business strategy focused on only developing intellectual property which can be, in his words, "exploited" over a long period, to the exclusion of new titles which cannot guarantee sequels.[19] In responding to why Activision Blizzard chose not to publish certain games following the Activision/Blizzard merger, he stated that focusing on franchises that "have the potential to be exploited every year on every platform with clear sequel potential and have the potential to become $100 million franchises" has "worked very well for Activision Blizzard". Kotick described this business strategy as "narrow and deep" or "annualizable" and cited it as key to attracting development talent who may not be drawn to "speculative franchises".[20] Kotick also created a stir when commenting on Activision Blizzard's peripheral-driven franchises. During Activision Blizzard's Q2 2009 financial results conference, Kotick was challenged over his "comfort level" around high prices attached to "new games that have some expensive controllers" and said, "if it was left to me, I would raise the prices even further."[21] While Spong took the comment at face value,[22] Gamesindustry.biz thought the comment was a joke, but could be seen as "insensitive at a time when consumers are likely to be feeling the economic pinch".[23]
A frequent complaint from the gaming press is the gap between Kotick and Activision's chief consumers. Ars Technica editor Ben Kuchera wrote, "Kotick doesn't play his games, and it shows."[19] Video game developer Tim Schafer said Kotick "doesn't have to be as much of a dick" in his attitude towards Activision's customers.[24] Gaming blog Kotaku reported, however, that Kotick confessed to a passion for video games that "has never really gone away," and "rattle[d] off an impressive list of consoles he's owned in the past and games he loved."[6]
Personal life
A native of Long Island, New York, Kotick resides in California with his family.[25] He divorced his wife in late 2012.[26] He had a cameo role in the 2011 film Moneyball.[27]

This article needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2017)


Early career
Kotick began his career in 1983 while he was still in college at the University of Michigan,[4][5] when he began creating software for the Apple II with financial backing from Steve Wynn.[6] Kotick credits Steve Jobs for advising him to drop out of college to pursue his entrepreneurial interests in the software business.[7]
In 1987, he tried to acquire Commodore International. He planned to remove the keyboard and disk drive from the Amiga 500 and turn it into the first 16 bit video game system. He was unsuccessful in persuading Commodore's then-Chairman Irving Gould to sell control of the company.[4][5] He subsequently purchased a controlling stake in Leisure Concepts, Nintendo's licensing agent,[5] which was renamed 4Kids Entertainment.[1]
Kotick and his partner Brian Kelly bought a 25% stake in Activision in December 1990,[4][5] and became CEO in February 1991.[1] Kotick also served as a founder of International Consumer Technologies and was President from 1986 to January 1995. In 1995, International Consumer Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision.[8]
Work with Activision Blizzard
At Activision, Kotick set out to build "an institutional quality, well managed company with a focus on the independent developer."[5] In a 14 June 2010 interview with gaming blog Kotaku, Kotick stated, "…[P]art of the whole philosophy of Activision was whether you're owned outright or not, if you're a studio you have control of your destiny, you could make decisions about who to hire, flexibility on what products to make, how to make them, schedules appropriate to make them, budgets."[6]
Kotick engineered the Activision Blizzard merge, and stockholders of Activision Blizzard approved Kotick as CEO of the combined company on 9 July 2008.[9] In 2009, as reported by Forbes magazine, Robert Kotick received approximately $3.2 million USD in salary, benefits, options and incentives for his work with Activision Blizzard, of which $953,654 was his actual salary.[1] By 2013, Kotick was the second highest compensated CEO in the United States, earning $64.9 million USD, mostly in stock.[10]
Kotick has used Activision Blizzard's industry position to push partners for changes that he maintains would benefit the gaming community. In July 2009, Kotick threatened to stop making games for the PlayStation 3 platform if Sony did not cut the price of the console.[11] Kotick also urged the British government to reward Activision for continuing to invest in the country's pool of game developers by providing Activision with the same kinds of tax incentives provided by Canada, Singapore and eastern bloc countries.[12] Kotick has launched an Independent Games Competition with $500,000 in total available prize money for small developers working with new platforms and has stated that "keeping passion in game development is something that's important to him."[4][13]
In October 2009, under Kotick’s direction, Activision Blizzard launched Call of Duty Endowment, a non-profit public benefit corporation, which helps soldiers transition to civilian careers after their military service, with a commitment to create thousands of jobs for veterans including those returning from the Middle East. Kotick recruited an advisory board composed of veterans representing the various service branches.[14]
Recent
In October 2016, Kotick confirmed the creation of Activision Blizzard's Overwatch League.[15]
In 2016 November, Activision Blizzard inked a deal with Kotick where he might receive bonuses if certain financial benchmarks were met concerning M&A. Earlier that that year, Activision had acquired companies such as King Digital Ent and Major League Gaming.[16]
Boards of Directors
Kotick was also a Yahoo! board member from March 2003 to August 2008,[1][17][18] and is currently a board member for the Center for Early Education, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Tony Hawk Foundation.[1]
Controversy
Gaming press

Kotick has at times been a controversial figure in the gaming community.[6] In part this can be attributed to advocating a business strategy focused on only developing intellectual property which can be, in his words, "exploited" over a long period, to the exclusion of new titles which cannot guarantee sequels.[19] In responding to why Activision Blizzard chose not to publish certain games following the Activision/Blizzard merger, he stated that focusing on franchises that "have the potential to be exploited every year on every platform with clear sequel potential and have the potential to become $100 million franchises" has "worked very well for Activision Blizzard". Kotick described this business strategy as "narrow and deep" or "annualizable" and cited it as key to attracting development talent who may not be drawn to "speculative franchises".[20] Kotick also created a stir when commenting on Activision Blizzard's peripheral-driven franchises. During Activision Blizzard's Q2 2009 financial results conference, Kotick was challenged over his "comfort level" around high prices attached to "new games that have some expensive controllers" and said, "if it was left to me, I would raise the prices even further."[21] While Spong took the comment at face value,[22] Gamesindustry.biz thought the comment was a joke, but could be seen as "insensitive at a time when consumers are likely to be feeling the economic pinch".[23]
A frequent complaint from the gaming press is the gap between Kotick and Activision's chief consumers. Ars Technica editor Ben Kuchera wrote, "Kotick doesn't play his games, and it shows."[19] Video game developer Tim Schafer said Kotick "doesn't have to be as much of a dick" in his attitude towards Activision's customers.[24] Gaming blog Kotaku reported, however, that Kotick confessed to a passion for video games that "has never really gone away," and "rattle[d] off an impressive list of consoles he's owned in the past and games he loved."[6]
Personal life
A native of Long Island, New York, Kotick resides in California with his family.[25] He divorced his wife in late 2012.[26] He had a cameo role in the 2011 film Moneyball.[27]

PEOPLE who love video games love to hate Bobby Kotick.Mr. Kotick, the C.E.O. of Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, inspired a stocky, auburn-haired character named Money Sack, who, in a game created by a competitor and a former employee, wields a wide grin and an automatic weapon. In another video, Mr. Kotick pops up from behind a fortified wall, and in a husky, ominous voice says he’ll set the price of his biggest game, Call of Duty, to “your soul” — a dig at its cost. Then fiery lasers shoot out of his eyes, wreaking havoc on an apocalyptic fantasy world. In several online photographs he is depicted as the Devil, with red horns against a Hades-like background.On this particular Sunday, it’s those Photoshopped horns that really irk Mr. Kotick. He is seated at a corner table in the cavernous breakfast room of the Pierre hotel, across the street from Central Park, shaking a leg nervously and whispering in a conspiratorial hush.“Think about what it’s like for my dating life when the first picture that comes up is me as the Devil,” says Mr. Kotick, who is recently divorced. “You see all this chatter and you realize that they game the search results. These super-sophisticated 19-year-olds are smarter than our expensive P.R. firm.” (His publicist, Steven Rubenstein, shrugs sheepishly.)Mr. Kotick, 49, has reason to be annoyed. Not since the music industry’s heyday has there been a business with such a wide disparity between the popularity of its products and its customers’ perception of the chief executive who made those products possible. Video games are among the most successful segments in the entertainment industry, and the disdain heaped on Mr. Kotick in video game blogs is second only to the admiration for him on Wall Street.

He bought the company that is now Activision in 1990, when it was nearly bankrupt and when analysts dismissed video games as fads. But in his 22 years as C.E.O. he has built Activision into a company with a stock market value of $12.7 billion, almost three times that of its top rival, Electronic Arts.

Mr. Kotick isn’t the most technology-driven executive. (He still prefers a BlackBerry.) And he doesn’t get into the weeds of creative storytelling; he leaves that to the studios Activision has acquired. But like David Geffen, who never played a musical instrument well but signed Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and the Eagles, Mr. Kotick has a knack for identifying hit after blockbuster hit. He wakes up each day thinking about those hits — some would say obsessing about them — and how Activision can lavish games like Call of Duty, Diablo and World of Warcraft with ever more bells and whistles to keep customers happy and ensure that the next release is a big success, too.The latest edition of Activision’s biggest game, the shoot’em-up megahit Call of Duty: Black Ops II, was released Nov. 13 and had sales of $500 million in its first 24 hours and more than $1 billion in the first 15 days. That fell short of some analysts’ expectations but was nevertheless more than the total domestic box-office revenue of “Avatar,” the highest-grossing movie of all time.BUT expensive, immersive games now face a challenge as free online games from companies like Zynga and Rovio compete for users’ attention. Retail sales of video games in the United States totaled $7.5 billion from January to October, down 26 percent from the same period in 2011, according to the NPD Group.In response, Activision is doubling down on a handful of games with high margins. The strategy is to have customers pay $60 or more to traverse for hundreds of hours through story lines with orchestral soundtracks and realistic, hologram-like heroes and heroines. With each new version “we need more resources, more time, and our development schedule has to get longer,” Mr. Kotick says. “How do you make the games better each year?”Developers of Call of Duty took the risky step of bringing the mostly historical war series into the not-so-distant future of 2025. David S. Goyer, co-writer of the story for “The Dark Knight Rises,” was a co-writer on the story for the latest Call of Duty. Trent Reznor, the Nine Inch Nails singer who won an Oscar for the soundtrack of “The Social Network,” did the theme song. Oliver L. North served as an adviser for the game, which features a virtual David H. Petraeus, the former Central Intelligence Agency director.The Activision strategy relies heavily on the holiday season. “This is a nail-biting time for us,” said Brian G. Kelly, Mr. Kotick’s longtime business partner, who is co-chairman of the Activision Blizzard board.In the three months ended Sept. 30, Activision exceeded analysts’ expectations and increased its earnings by 53 percent, to $226 million, or 20 cents a share, even as video game console sales declined slightly.

Mr. Kotick’s compensation is tied to the company’s performance. He made more than $8 million in 2011 and has an estimated net worth of over $1 billion. Fans have complained that Activision rakes in revenue by increasing the prices of their beloved games — though the company says the new Call of Duty costs around $60, the same price as previous releases. Fans also bemoan its practice of releasing only a few franchise games a year.“He gets wealthy if investors get wealthy and that’s why investors really like the guy and most gamers hate the guy,” Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said of Mr. Kotick.In an industry that is equal parts glitz and gritty computer programming, Mr. Kotick has always fit firmly among the former. He made a cameo in “Moneyball,” the 2011 film, as a cheapskate baseball team owner. His Beverly Hills home is filled with Abstract Expressionist art, and he recently flew his helicopter to pick up his friend Jeffrey Katzenberg for a Los Angeles Lakers game.Mr. Kotick’s games may regularly make more money than the movies, but his movie-star lifestyle doesn’t sit well with some gamers.But mostly Mr. Kotick has never lived down a 2009 Forbes magazine article that praised his business acumen but said he did not play video games, a claim that he says was inaccurate.Gamers went ballistic. “It’s doubtful he even knows the name of Azeroth,” the video game writer Ben Kuchera said of Mr. Kotick, a reference to the fantasy world in World of Warcraft, an online, multiplayer Activision Blizzard game with more than 10 million subscribers.Mr. Kotick dismisses such accusations. “When you dig down and look at the people who are vocal in their criticism of me, it’s a small number,” Mr. Kotick says. He holds out his thumb and says he had calluses from playing too much Defender, a 1980s arcade game set on a fictional planet that requires users to protect astronauts by shooting aliens. Today, he says he mostly plays Activision’s newest series, Skylanders, with his 11-year-old daughter.“People criticize me for not being passionate about the products, but I am,” he says.BUT even if it wasn’t about playing his own games, there’s something about Robert A. Kotick, a brassy Long Islander turned Hollywood mogul, who strikes some critics as the type of moneyed, outgoing jokester who would have teased obsessive gamers in high school.

He once spotted Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, surrounded by security guards, and jokingly put him in a chokehold from behind.“Is that Bobby Kotick?” Mr. Villaraigosa said, without turning around, according to a person who was standing with the mayor. Bobby Kotick is that kind of guy.Even in high school in Roslyn, N.Y., he had a taste for showmanship, picking up friends in a chauffeured limo to take them to Studio 54. He showed up at college at the University of Michigan in a Fiat convertible, with a stack of Italian cashmere sweaters in various ’80s hues, according to two former classmates.Ask the casino giant Steve Wynn and he’ll tell you that Mr. Kotick is still the precocious, if pushy, 19-year-old who in 1982 started a technology company with a friend and computer whiz, Howard Marks, in their Michigan dorm room. That company, the Arktronics Corporation, made a software package called Jane that cost $295 and was designed to emulate Apple’s Lisa operating system, which back then cost $10,000.During his sophomore year, Mr. Kotick, trying to secure financing for the company, tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron’s Ball in Dallas, a denim-and-diamonds fund-raiser held at Southfork Ranch, the setting of the fictional home of J. R. Ewing. That’s where he met Mr. Wynn.Mr. Kotick hitched a ride on Mr. Wynn’s plane to Atlantic City, figuring he could always make his way back to his parents’ house on Long Island. He used the flight to pitch Mr. Wynn on Arktronics.A couple of weeks later, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Marks were summoned to Mr. Wynn’s office, then on the top floor of the Bankers Trust building on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Bodyguards took them to a nearby heliport, from which they were flown to the Golden Nugget hotel in Atlantic City. Waiting in the casino basement, Mr. Kotick said he envisioned Mr. Wynn emerging in a custom Fioravanti suit and a pinkie ring. When he arrived, Mr. Wynn gave them a check for $300,000 to invest in Arktronics. (Mr. Wynn confirms the story, but has said he’s never worn a pinkie ring.)Mr. Kotick asked if they needed a contract.“ ‘Contracts-schmontracks — we’re family now,’ ” Mr. Wynn replied, in Mr. Kotick’s telling.

Mr. Kotick says: “I thought: ‘O.K., we’re in the basement with a guy who owns casinos who said we’re his family now. We’re going to die.”

The investment paid off. Ten years later, after Mr. Kotick had bought a controlling stake in a nearly insolvent company called Mediagenic and built it into Activision, he stopped by Mr. Wynn’s white-leathered office at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. He asked Mr. Wynn if he had been paying attention to the Activision share price, which then was about $18.“I have no idea about Activision,” Mr. Wynn said. “Is that good, Bobby?”“It’s good if you own a million and a half shares,” Mr. Kotick replied.“I sat at my desk speechless,” Mr. Wynn recalled recently, while on board his private jet, a Bombardier Global Express, en route to Monte Carlo. “The kid was telling me I had $31 million I didn’t know about.”Mr. Wynn was henceforth known as Uncle Steve.But it was another Steve, Steven P. Jobs of Apple, who persuaded Mr. Kotick to drop out of college. Mr. Jobs had heard about the Jane software package and visited Mr. Kotick and Mr. Marks in Ann Arbor. He told them that they were wasting their time in class.Mr. Kotick, an art history major, took the advice. At the time, his father, a real estate lawyer, and his mother, a homemaker and art collector, were skeptical. In a 1983 Forbes article, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Marks were shown grinning in front of an Andy Warhol silk-screen of Steve Wynn. A subheading read: “When Bobby Kotick wanted to get into the computer business, his father told him to cut the crap and start doing some schoolwork.”Seven years later, Mr. Kotick and his partners paid $440,000 for a controlling stake in Mediagenic , a software company founded by Atari programmers. It had $30 million in debt and $2 million in assets, and its office in Menlo Park, Calif., was in such disarray that the local sheriff showed up to repossess an I.B.M. mainframe computer. Mr. Kotick says an office assistant handed over a cheaper PDP 11 computer instead. The sheriff “didn’t know the difference between an I.B.M. and a PDP 11,” Mr. Kotick recalls.MR. KOTICK and Mr. Kelly moved the company to Santa Monica, Calif., and aggressively acquired development studios. In 1994, Activision raised $42.5 million from private investors. “That’s when I felt like we cannot fail. We have to make this successful,” Mr. Kotick says.The company spent much of that money on increased production and distribution of new games. From 1997 to 2003, Activision acquired nine development studios. In 1995, it introduced its first hit game, MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, followed in 1999 by the popular Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.

Then, in 2008, Mr. Kotick spearheaded one of the largest video game mergers in history when he combined Activision Inc. with the games division of Vivendi, the French telecommunications conglomerate; that unit was mostly made up of Blizzard Entertainment. Today, the combined company has more than 7,000 employees worldwide.“It’s one of the great success stories of all time,” says Herb Allen III, the president of Allen & Company, the boutique investment bank.This past July, Activision was the talk of Allen & Company’s media and technology retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, after reports emerged that Vivendi had consulted Goldman Sachs and Barclays about selling its 61 percent stake in Activision Blizzard. At a price tag of roughly $8.1 billion, no buyer immediately emerged. The uncertainty has put pressure on Activision’s stock, which closed at $11.41 on Friday, down from a 52-week high of $13.01 in May. A spokesman for Vivendi declined to comment.As the stakes in the video game industry have skyrocketed, so have the number of lawsuits. Gaming has started to look more like the movie industry, with creators and executives often suing each other over who should benefit from the windfall of profits on successful games.In May, Mr. Kotick settled a lawsuit against two of the founders of Infinity Ward, the video game developer and Activision subsidiary that created Call of Duty. Activision acquired Infinity Ward for $5 million in 2003; since then, it has turned Call of Duty into a multibillion-dollar franchise and one of the world’s most lucrative entertainment assets.The developers Jason West and Vince Zampella sued Activision, accusing it of wrongful termination, after they were fired in 2010. Activision countersued, contending that the employees had been disloyal. Activision later sued Electronic Arts for recruiting Mr. West and Mr. Zampella.The lawsuit enraged the game world. Mr. Kotick was painted as an evil capitalist and the developers as creative heroes. But Mr. Kotick says the decision to let the developers go was a no-brainer. “You find out two executives are planning to break their contracts, keep the money you gave them and steal 40 employees. What do you do? You fire them,” he says.Robert M. Schwartz, a lawyer for Mr. West and Mr. Zampella, said Mr. Kotick had “falsely promised huge bonuses and franchise control” to his clients. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, said Mr. Kotick’s “history of suing developers and competitors” appears to be “a fundamental part of his business model.”

CALL OF DUTY may look like a movie, but Mr. Kotick has little interest in turning it into one — and has turned down several studios’ requests. He says movies based on video games rarely please devoted fans and could taint the brand.“He’s a very, very careful thinker about how value is created in the business,” says Bruce Hack, who was chief executive of Vivendi Games when it merged with Activision. He says that most Silicon Valley companies, meanwhile, haven’t figured out how to make money on free online games.But analysts caution that even the most popular brands reach saturation. Call of Duty, which makes up an estimated one-third of Activision’s more than $4 billion in annual revenue, faces a potential threat from the Electronic Arts shooter game Battlefield 3.In 2010, Activision stopped making Guitar Hero, the game that lets users become living-room rock stars, after the market became flooded with it and related knockoffs. Since then, Activision has lacked a game that widely appeals to women. “Guitar Hero was much more about us not innovating in a way that was appealing to audiences,” Mr. Kotick says. “It’s not about oversaturating the market.”Last year, Activision released the first version of Skylanders, a video game with accompanying figurines; it’s aimed at young boys. Mr. Kotick, giddy about an entirely new concept in a company based mostly on old reliables, showed off a stack of prototype Skylanders action figures to friends.“We’re at some fancy-pantsy restaurant, and he has a shopping bag with him,” Mr. Katzenberg recalls. “I’m trying to be polite, but everyone is staring at us like we’ve lost our minds. Here are two grown men playing with toys.”Mr. Katzenberg, a prominent donor in Democratic Party politics, says he’s close to Mr. Kotick despite their political differences. Mr. Kotick, who calls himself a libertarian, voted for Mitt Romney for president, and in 2007 and 2008 donated a combined $47,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Mr. Kotick’s restlessness and competitiveness lead his friends to speculate about what he will do next, and whether it will be at Activision or elsewhere.“I like what I’m doing,” Mr. Kotick says. “If I didn’t like what I was doing, I’d be doing something else.”

Mr. Wynn, for one, doesn’t see his surrogate nephew sitting still.“He’s got to decide what to do with the rest of his life,” says Mr. Wynn from somewhere over the Atlantic. He compares Mr. Kotick to the millionaire bank robber who tested his luck with a second heist in “The Thomas Crown Affair” — the 1968 version with Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen. “I think all of us in life want to know if we can do it twice.”

Last modified on Tuesday 21 February 2017 12.44 EST






Three years ago, a group of senior Activision executives led by CEO Bobby Kotick met with Stephane Kurgan and Riccardo Zacconi, the heads of mobile gaming company King. It was, says Kotick, a social engagement, two powerhouses of the global games industry shooting the breeze in a fancy restaurant. During an investor call this week, however, Zacconi talked about the “mutual fear and respect” at the table. Executives don’t meet like this for fun. They were sizing each other up.
On Monday, Activision announced that it would be acquiring King, creator of the massively successful Candy Crush Saga game – as well as other more modest smartphone hits – for $5.9bn. Predictably, the revelation sent shockwaves through the industry: it’s a hefty sum – more than Disney paid for legacy entertainment companies Marvel and LucasFilm. What was Activision thinking?
Of course, the basic strategy was obvious. Although Activision is big in console games with its Call of Duty, Destiny and Skylanders brands, and has might in PC gaming thanks to the Blizzard titles (Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft), it has largely failed to make an impact in the explosive smartphone gaming sector. Purchasing King would bring it an experienced workforce, plenty of proven IP, and a vast global audience, stretching far beyond the traditional “hardcore” gaming demographic.
But analysts were quick to question the deal. King shares have consistently traded below the asking price set at the company’s disastrous IPO in March 2014. The latest accounts showed an 18% year-on-year fall in revenue. Candy Crush Saga has probably peaked, and although titles like Pet Rescue and Farm Heroes have performed well, they’re not doing well enough to replace Candy Crush Saga as the sugar rush fades. 
In a coruscating article on the deal, the journalist Rob Fahey wrote: “In all likelihood, Activision has just paid a huge premium for a company which is past the peak of its greatest hit title and into a period of managed decline, not to mention a company with which its core businesses simply don’t fit in any meaningful way.” 
The IHS Digital analyst Piers Harding-Rolls added: “The mobile games market is highly unpredictable, even with a strong set of games franchises and brands success is far from guaranteed.” 
So what does Bobby Kotick make of all this? Activision’s boss, the pantomime villain of gamers everywhere, is the longest-standing CEO in the tech industry. In 1991, he took control of a fading games company and over the next 25 years turned it into an entertainment giant with a brand – Call of Duty – that could dwarf Hollywood box office takings. Unsurprisingly, he has a different view on the deal.
“Look, here’s my immodesty,” he says via a phone call from Activision’s HQ in Santa Monica, “but if you look at the growth in operating profits and the return on invested capital that we’ve generated for our shareholders, we are really good at prioritising opportunities. We have now gotten to a place where we’ve seen mobile as an opportunity. We’ve prioritised it, evaluated a variety of alternatives, both building and buying, and we came to the conclusion that King does the best job of any team that we’ve come across in the creation of franchises, in sustaining those franchises, in commercialising those franchises and thinking about new franchises. Today, mobile is a $36bn market. King supports audiences in 196 countries. We felt very confident that they were the right partner for us.”
But then, traditional game publishers have floundered in the past when they tried to buy their way into the mobile industry. Electronic Arts paid $680m for Jamdat in 2005, $300m for social gaming specialist Playfish in 2009 and $750m for Bejeweled creator PopCap Games in 2011. While the latter still exists as a brand, the others have faded and disappeared. Is this not a stark lesson in how the gears grind when very different development cultures meet?
“Well, if you look at the history of our company, we don’t do a lot of acquisition,” says Kotick. “The reason is, we need to see that people are culturally and philosophically aligned with the way that we approach the business. At the end of that first meeting with Riccardo and Stephane I said to the other Activision participants, ‘That team is aligned with the way we operate the business. If we can someday figure out how to do something with them we should’. It’s very rare that you find people who have the same commitments, and the same commercial instinct.”
Kotick also shrugs off concerns about King’s reliance on Candy Crush. “They had product concentration, and so Mr Market looks at that and says, ‘Hey, you know, is that a one-trick pony?’ But when we looked at King, we saw four great franchises with lots of potential, one super franchise, and a fantastic pipeline. That got us really excited.”
From King’s point of view, the deal makes sense in that it gives them Activision’s proven IP with which to build new smartphone titles. But again, there’s another question: is the world ready for Call of Duty Saga? Destiny Soda? Skylanders Rescue? The latter is the most obvious brand for re-thinking into the casual smartphone space, and Call of Duty should be a useful asset in the growing “mid-core” sector of more challenging mobile gaming experiences. 
But is that what this is about? “Just reskinning games with our intellectual property is not an appealing prospect for opportunity,” assures Kotick. “That isn’t something that creates long-term value for shareholders.”
Indeed, you get the sense that what really interests Activision – or at least its CEO – is sheer numbers. “We now have 500 million players in 196 countries around the world,” he says with barely contained zeal. “In the past, our business was largely concentrated around middle-class consumers who could afford $300 or $400 for a dedicated game console or $1000 for a PC. Now, with the introduction of high-quality mobile devices, we’re looking at everybody being a consumer. And one of the things I love about King is 60 percent of their consumer base is female. There are more opportunities now than we’ve ever had before.”
That’s the thing really. Over the last five years the console games industry has grown to resemble its younger smartphone sibling. The future is about what he calls “perpetual franchises”: the old model of annual boxed copy iterations is coming to an end. Call of Duty with its scheduled DLC drops, Destiny with its endless feed of new content – it’s about building communities and engagement now; it’s about finding new models for a growing audience that now thinks about games in a different way. King was able to rise up within the densely crowded smartphone space with an “audience first, revenue later” approach that Activision now covets. 
“From Activision’s point of view the relatively slow burn of this generations console market and the transition towards increasingly digital delivery is major risk for their business – like any traditional publisher – so it makes sense to consolidate their position by acquiring one of the giants of mobile gaming,” says smartphone industry veteran Oscar Clark, now at Unity. “Leaving King as a separate entity is a smart move but if Activision is to really benefit they have to really learn from them and be willing and able to adapt themselves.”
One thing’s for sure, Kotick is never off duty. He has drawn the ire of core gamers with Activision’s endless cycle of money-spinning brands, the DLC packs, the vast number of Skylanders toys, the expense of keeping up to date with Destiny, but the monster rolls on regardless. You can bet when he sat across the table from those King executives three years ago, he wasn’t seeing two guys, he was seeing a new audience of many, many millions, in parts of the world even Call of Duty never reached. And right now, according to him, that’s all he cares about.
“Look, the way we see it, this audience is investing in our content right now,” he says. “Whether they’re paying for it or not is not really relevant. They’re investing a significant amount of time in our content. At some point, commercial opportunities will materialise for greater percentages of that audience.”
Time will tell if the numbers convert into revenue. But for Activision, whatever you think of the company, the numbers usually do.

This is a partial transcript from "Your World with Neil Cavuto," May 16, 2005, that was edited for clarity.
NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Well, it is an all-out war, not in Iraq, in your living room. The most anticipated video games and consoles are going head-to-head at the 2005 Electronics Arts Expo this week.
What's in store? Well, let us ask Bobby Kotick. Bobby is the chairman and the CEO of video game maker Activision (ATVI).
Good to have you with us. Thank you for coming.
ROBERT KOTICK, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ACTIVISION: Thanks, Neil.
CAVUTO: What's hot this year?
KOTICK: Well, for us, we have a new "Spider-Man." We have a new "X- Men." We have a game based on "Madagascar" that's coming out shortly, a new "Fantastic Four," "Quake" and the new Tony Hawk. So, we have a really, really strong lineup of products for the back half of this year.
CAVUTO: Do you guys spill over each other, with the Sony PlayStation3 starting and then the Microsoft Xbox supposed to be all souped-up graphics and this new multidimensional screen. The same money is chasing the same relatively finite crowd, isn't it?
KOTICK: Not really.
In fact, what you find is, there's actually a lot of cross-ownership. But these new products that will come out into the marketplace have dramatically new features. I have been in this business for now almost 14 years. I have never seen the kind of improvements we're seeing graphically. You're going to — for the first time — see high-definition display capabilities and audio capabilities.
CAVUTO: Are you doing that? Are you doing that? Or is Microsoft doing that?
KOTICK: Well, Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) make the hardware. But we make the software that supports it.
CAVUTO: I got you. When you say that there's cross-ownership, are you saying that people own an Xbox, they own a Sony PlayStation, they own Activision? Are they all together?
KOTICK: Well, remember, today, you're looking at probably 75 percent of American households with children have one active video game system. And we really don't care which system you have, because we make software for all of the systems.
CAVUTO: You will make it for everybody. Right. Right. Right.
I know you had pursued — if I'm getting this out of context, please correct me — maybe advertising hidden in some of the games. Is that true?
KOTICK: We're in the early sort of exploration phase.
And the catalyst for that is, when you look at television watching habits — and this is some data that we commissioned from Nielsen — but, about a year ago, we looked at the 2004 year, and what it turned out is that television watching to 18- to 35-year-old males in the U.S. was roughly 30 billion hours. And video game playing was roughly the same 30 billion hours.
Advertisers spent over $8 billion on TV to the 18- to 35-year-old males in the U.S. alone, but spent negligible amounts of money advertising in video games. And yet we're delivering...
CAVUTO: But when you say advertising in video games, is it product placement, which I don't think most people would have a problem with, or is it an outright ad, either before the start of the game, during a game, after the game? What?
KOTICK: It's primarily really tightly integrated product placement, making sure that the products have an appropriateness to our audiences.
But, I mean, you think about the power of — in a Tony Hawk game — going from level three to level four and having to drink a Coca-Cola or a Pepsi, you're reaching millions of consumers, hundreds of hours per consumer. It's a really positive association. So we see, you know, four or five years from now, this being a potentially big opportunity.
CAVUTO: All right. Thank you very much, Bobby Kotick of Activision. Good seeing you.
KOTICK: Likewise, Neil. Thank you.
