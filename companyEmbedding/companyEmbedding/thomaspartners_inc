Why ThomasPartners










An income growth strategy that strives to deliver. 
Again and again and again.
Rigorously focused on consistent income and income growth, the ThomasPartners® Dividend Growth Strategy has three goals.
Goal 1: Monthly income 
Because ThomasPartners invests in companies that pay dividends and have the ability to grow those dividends annually, it's designed to provide monthly income—whether the market goes up or down. You can take this payout as monthly dividend income now or reinvest it for future growth.
Goal 2: Annual income growth
The cost of living increases every year, so ThomasPartners aims to offset inflation with a dividend payout designed to grow every year too.
Goal 3: Competitive Total Returns, over time. 
Investing has a lifelong purpose, so the strategy seeks to deliver long–term, risk-adjusted competitive total returns to help our clients achieve their goals.
Our commitment to the three objectives on monthly income, annual income growth and competitive total returns, over time, is disciplined and constant. All equities purchased for ThomasPartners client portfolios pay cash dividends and are expected to deliver annual dividend increases in the future. All equities purchased for ThomasPartners client portfolios are also expected to deliver earnings growth over time. All equities purchased for ThomasPartners client portfolios are priced, at the time of purchase, at levels ThomasPartners believes to be discounts to the underlying company’s intrinsic value.  These companies also provide a significant free cash flow “cushion” over the current yield, thus providing confidence that the dividend is secure and that future dividend growth is well within the company’s financial capacity.

Why Dividends -  ThomasPartners

Why Dividends










The simple sophistication behind the strategy.
Dividends are powerful investment management tools: they typically deliver predictable annual income, income that can be spent or reinvested; they may dampen portfolio volatility; they provide additive  annual rewards; and, over time, they may drive prices higher. In fact, according to the Chart below, over an extended historical period stocks that initiate or increase their dividends have outperformed other stocks with different dividend policies.
Our commitment to this philosophy is disciplined and constant. ThomasPartners® invests in companies that pay their shareholders dividends—and have the ability to grow those dividend annually.
THE POTENTIAL OF DIVIDEND-GROWING STOCKS.

Chart source: ThomasPartners Research with data from the CRSP® 1962 U.S. Stock Database. © 2015 Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. See below for additional information.  Includes all publicly traded U.S. companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion (in today’s dollars), adjusted historically for inflation. Beginning in 1976, membership in each dividend classification is set as of January 1 for each year, and then held constant for the next 12‐month period. Dividend Growers and Initiators include stocks that initiated or increased their dividend over the next 12 months. No‐Change stocks are those that maintained their existing per‐share cash dividend over the next 12 months. Dividend Cutters and Eliminators are companies that lowered or eliminated their dividend at some point over the next 12 months. Dividend Non‐Payers are companies that did not pay a dividend at any time over the next 12 months. The average return is the compound annualized equally-weighted average return for the 1976‐2015 time frame.  Indices are unmanaged and cannot be invested directly.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.
A rigorous process.
Not all dividend-growing companies make it into the ThomasPartners strategy. Standards are extremely high, and the selection process is rigorous.
ThomasPartners managers choose companies—or eliminate them—following careful evaluation of each company's:

Dividend-growing track record  and Predicted ability to sustain that growth in the future 
Ongoing business performance and how well it meets the  standards set by ThomasPartners
Stock price and discount it trades at versus ThomasPartners’ measure of intrinsic value.
This sophisticated stock selection approach, coupled with thorough ongoing management, has helped create low investment turnover and is designed to help ThomasPartners achieve its three objectives. View performance since inception.

Why ThomasPartners®?
When you realize your investments must cover most of the expenses you have today, maintaining your lifestyle in retirement can seem challenging. Our founder, Greg Thomas, faced this when he reached his own retirement. Like most retirees, he started questioning his financial readiness. His quest to find answers led him to create ThomasPartners.
Today, over 15 years later, ThomasPartners manages over $10 billion.1 Our focus is on helping you achieve and maintain the retirement you want through income-oriented strategies that meet your needs today and in the future.


“When I retired in 1992, I knew exactly what I wanted from my investment strategy: dependable, regular income. And income that kept pace with inflation. I found, though, that typical strategies could deliver one or the other but never both. And that got me thinking.”
—Greg Thomas, Founder and Chief Investment Strategist



One philosophy, two strategies.
ThomasPartners offers two investment approaches: an equity strategy and a strategy blended with equities and fixed income. Both strive to deliver a reliable source of income to help you reach retirement and have the funds you need to get through it.




ThomasPartners Dividend Growth Strategy
This may be the right strategy for you if you are looking for an equity solution designed to complement a broader portfolio.




            ThomasPartners Dividend Growth Strategy is composed entirely of equities.
        





ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy
This may be the right strategy for you if you are looking for a blend of equities and fixed income.




            ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy is a blend of equities and fixed income.

1. All ThomasPartners data is updated as of 12/31/2016 unless otherwise noted. Past performance does not guarantee future results; the value of investments and the income derived from them can go down as well as up. Future returns and the achievement of stated goals are not guaranteed and a loss of principal may occur.Diversification strategies do not ensure a profit and do not protect against losses in declining markets. Investments in managed accounts should be considered in view of a larger, more diversified investment portfolio. There are risks associated with any investment approach, and the ThomasPartners strategies have their own set of risks. First, there are the risks associated with investing in dividend-paying stocks, including but not limited to the risk that stocks in the strategy may reduce or stop paying dividends, affecting the strategy’s ability to generate income. Second, investor sentiment could cause dividend-paying equities to fall out of favor and decrease in price. Third, there are risks associated with investing in fixed income asset classes, including through the use of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that include but are not limited to interest rate risk, credit risk, high yield risk, and government security risk. Please discuss these and other potential risks with your Financial Consultant prior to investing. Portfolio management is provided by ThomasPartners, Inc. ("ThomasPartners"), a registered investment advisor. ThomasPartners and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation. ThomasPartners strategies are available through the Schwab Managed Account Connection® ("Connection") program.

If you are not completely satisfied for any reason, at your request Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") or Charles Schwab Bank ("Schwab Bank"), as applicable, will refund any eligible fee related to your concern within the timeframes described below. Two kinds of "Fees" are eligible for this guarantee: (1) asset-based "Program Fees" for the Schwab Private Client ("SPC"), Schwab Managed Portfolios ("SMP"), Schwab Intelligent Advisory ("SIA"), and Managed Account Connection ("Connection") investment advisory services sponsored by Schwab (together, the "Participating Services"); and (2) commissions and fees listed in the Charles Schwab Pricing Guide  for Individual Investors and the Schwab Bank Deposit Account Pricing Guide  (together, "Account Fees"). Program Fee refund requests must be received no later than the next calendar quarter after the Fee was charged. Account Fee refund requests must be received within one year of the date that the Fee was charged. 

Program Fees are calculated as a percentage of eligible assets in Participating Service accounts. For more information about Program Fees, please see the disclosure brochure for the Participating Service, made available at enrollment or any time at your request. The Connection service includes only accounts managed by investment advisors affiliated with Schwab: Windhaven Investment Management, Inc., ThomasPartners, Inc., and Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. The guarantee does not cover Program Fees for accounts managed by investment advisors who are not affiliated with Schwab or managed by Schwab-affiliated advisors outside of the SPC, SMP, SIA and Connection services. 

The guarantee is only available to current clients. Refunds will only be applied to the account charged and will be credited within approximately four weeks of a valid request. No other charges or expenses, and no market losses will be refunded. Other restrictions may apply. Schwab reserves the right to change or terminate the guarantee at any time.

  "We have worked together with Schwab since 2001, with more than half our        assets currently custodied on Schwab’s Advisor Services platform, and we        are excited to be joining such a great company" 



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Charles Schwab Corporation today announced an agreement to acquire 
      ThomasPartners, Inc., which includes an upfront payment of $85 million 
      in cash and the opportunity for additional payments contingent on future 
      growth in assets under management (AUM). The deal is expected to close 
      during the fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.
    

      Headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts, ThomasPartners is a dividend 
      income-focused asset management firm with $2.3 billion in AUM as of 
      September 30, 2012, in largely growth-oriented investment portfolios 
      designed to generate dividend income streams. ThomasPartners has 
      consistently outperformed relevant benchmarks over the nine-year history 
      of its dividend product.
    

      At current AUM levels, Schwab anticipates that the acquisition will be 
      neutral to EPS for the first 12 months post-closing, and become modestly 
      accretive within the next 12 months. Given demographic trends that are 
      fueling growing demand for income-oriented investment strategies, Schwab 
      intends to further leverage ThomasPartners’ strong track record of 
      growth and performance over time.
    

      Post-closing plans include:
    


        The CEO and chairman of ThomasPartners, Gregory Thomas, and his 
        investment team led by president, chief operating officer and chief 
        investment officer William McMahon, will remain with the firm in order 
        to maintain and oversee the investment and portfolio management 
        processes in place today.
      

        Its money management solutions will be made available at a lower cost 
        to clients of independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) 
        through the Schwab Advisor Services platform. At closing Schwab will 
        waive transaction commission costs for ThomasPartners’ managed 
        accounts custodied on Schwab’s Advisor Services platform.
      

        ThomasPartners’ portfolios will be offered to Schwab retail clients as 
        part of its growing selection of advisory solutions which include 
        Schwab Advisor Network, Windhaven Portfolios, Schwab Managed 
        Portfolios, Schwab Private Client, and access to third party portfolio 
        management. Assets in advised accounts at Schwab have grown steadily 
        over the years and today stand at $124 billion. After closing, 
        ThomasPartners will no longer directly market to individual investors.
      


      “There is a growing interest among investors and investment advisors in 
      the growth-oriented dividend income approach that is ThomasPartners’ 
      core focus and expertise,” said Walt Bettinger, Schwab president and 
      chief executive officer. “With more than four million baby boomers 
      entering retirement age each year in the United States, and tens of 
      millions approaching that milestone over the coming decade, a rapidly 
      growing segment of investors and investment advisors are focusing on 
      producing income within their investment portfolios. ThomasPartners’ 
      dividend strategy complements Schwab’s existing asset management line-up 
      and helps provide our clients with a more complete range of money 
      management solutions to serve them along their investing journey.”
    

      According to Cerulli1, assets in separately managed account 
      programs grew at a compound annual growth rate of 12.0% from 1999 to 
      2011 versus 4.6% for long-term securities. They are expected to grow at 
      a CAGR of 14% from 2011 to 2015.
    

      “We have worked together with Schwab since 2001, with more than half our 
      assets currently custodied on Schwab’s Advisor Services platform, and we 
      are excited to be joining such a great company,” said Gregory Thomas, 
      chairman and CEO of ThomasPartners. “We believe the stars are aligned 
      for a growing demand for the kind of money management approach we 
      deliver, and Schwab’s large national footprint, wonderful reputation and 
      growing client base will enable us to reach a vastly larger potential 
      pool of investors.”
    

Forward Looking Statement


      This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to the 
      closing of the ThomasPartners transaction, the effect of 
      the ThomasPartners transaction on Schwab’s EPS, the employment of the 
      ThomasPartners team post closing, and the growing demand for 
      income-oriented investment strategies, that reflect management’s current 
      expectations. Achievement of these expectations is subject to risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      the expressed expectations. Important factors that may cause such 
      differences include, but are not limited to, satisfaction of conditions 
      to closing the transaction, integration of ThomasPartners’ business into 
      Schwab, general market conditions, including the level of interest 
      rates, equity valuations and trading activity, and other factors set 
      forth in Schwab’s Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2012.

ThomasPartners® Balanced Income Strategy.
The ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy combines the firm's dividend growth strategy with fixed income investments. The strategy has a baseline allocation of 60% equities and 40% fixed income, which can be adjusted by the ThomasPartners Investment Team to help meet its three objectives.







The first objective: monthly income.
Wherever you are in life, it’s likely that one of your primary financial goals is to generate income—income that can help you live comfortably today or income that you can invest now and draw from when you retire. ThomasPartners Balanced Income seeks to provide monthly income by investing in companies with predictable dividends and interest-paying fixed income investments.


The second objective: income growth.
To assist in offsetting the impact of inflation, the ThomasPartners Balanced Income portfolio strategically invests within and allocates across dividend-growth companies and fixed income investments in an effort to grow the portfolio’s income over time.
How are dividend-growing companies and fixed income investments chosen?
Each company is carefully analyzed. Its dividend-growing track record—and its ability to sustain that growth in the future—is considered, questioned, and evaluated. And, once selected, the company is continuously reevaluated. If a company fails to meet ThomasPartners’ high standards, it’s eliminated.
                                                The firm's fixed income philosophy is risk-averse, with fundamentally driven positions chosen based on credit spreads and duration.


The third objective: competitive total returns over time.
Pursue the retirement you want with an investment strategy that’s built to prepare you for the years ahead. In addition to regular income and income growth, the ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy seeks to deliver competitive total returns over time through income generation and price appreciation. If you’re at a stage of life where you don’t need to withdraw your income, you can enjoy the power of compounding, since accumulated income can be reinvested in the ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy over time.




Estimated Income Growth Since Inception



        Estimated Growth Since Inception: Beginning 05/31/03 and ending 12/31/16, the hypothetical $1 million investment would ultimately yield an annual income of $69,778 for ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy Composite, $56,434 for NASDAQ U.S. Broad Divdend Achievers Index, and $51,862 for S&P 500 Total Return Index.
    




        Estimated Growth Since Inception: Beginning 05/31/03 and ending 12/31/16, the hypothetical $1 million investment would ultimately yield an annual income of $69,778 for ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy Composite, $56,434 for NASDAQ U.S. Broad Divdend Achievers Index, and $51,862 for S&P 500 Total Return Index.
    

Based on a hypothetical $1 million initial investment on 5/31/2003. Income growth during certain periods may have been flat or negative. The Balanced Income Strategy is not representative of any single client account and currently uses exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for fixed income exposure, rather than the individual bonds and ETFs that are reflected in this performance chart. Please see below for further information.


Growth of a Hypothetical $1 Million Investment



        Growth Of A Hypothetical $1 Million Investment | Beginning 5/31/03 and ending 12/31/16, the $1 million investment would grow to: Thomas Partners Balanced Income Strategy (net of actual fees): 2.5M | NASDAQ U.S. Broad Dividend Achievers Index TR (DAATR): 2.2M | S&P 500® Total Return Index: 2.5M

Past performance does not guarantee future results; the value of investments and the income derived from them can go down as well as up. Future returns and the achievement of stated goals are not guaranteed, and a loss of principal may occur. 

Diversification strategies do not ensure a profit and do not protect against losses in declining markets. Investments in managed accounts should be considered in view of a larger, more diversified investment portfolio. 

There are risks associated with any investment approach, and the ThomasPartners strategies have their own set of risks. First, there are the risks associated with investing in dividend-paying stocks, including but not limited to the risk that stocks in the strategy may reduce or stop paying dividends, affecting the strategy’s ability to generate income. Second, investor sentiment could cause dividend-paying equities to fall out of favor and decrease in price. Third, there are risks associated with investing in fixed income asset classes, including through the use of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that include but are not limited to interest rate risk, credit risk, high yield risk, and government security risk. Please discuss these and other potential risks with your Financial Consultant prior to investing. 

Dividend Growing Stocks Chart: 

ThomasPartners research with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP®) 1962 U.S. Stock Database. ©2015 CRSP, University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The Dividend Growing Stocks chart includes all publicly traded U.S. companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion (in today’s dollars), adjusted historically for inflation. Beginning in 1976, membership in each dividend classification is set as of January 1 for each year, and then held constant for the next 12-month period (each, a “period”). Dividend Growers and Initiators include stocks that initiated or increased their dividend over the period. No-Change stocks are those that maintained their existing dividend at some point over the period. Dividend Non-Payers are companies that did not pay a dividend at any time over the period. The average return is the compound-analyzed equally weighted average return for each period in the 1976–2015 time frame. 

Estimated Income Growth Since Inception Charts: 

The ThomasPartners Balanced Income Strategy Composite as shown does not represent any one account. Beginning in August 2016, the fixed income allocation for the Balanced Income Strategy for accounts opened through the Schwab Connection platform will be invested in ETFs to gain exposure to fixed income, rather than the historical use of individual bonds and ETFs for the strategy. As such, a client’s actual performance will vary from the reported Composite performance because of this change in investment vehicles. The ThomasPartners Dividend Growth Strategy Composite is shown for illustrative purposes and is not available for direct investment. It does not represent the performance of any actual account. Estimated Annual Income is hypothetical. Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations. No representation is made that a client will achieve results similar to those shown. Actual accounts managed by ThomasPartners may have had performance that differs from the performance shown in the chart during comparable periods due to the customization of advice to each client and other factors. 

The Estimated Income Growth Since Inception charts assume that a client invested $1 million in the strategy on its inception date (Dividend Growth—3/31/2003, Balanced Income—5/31/2003). Each period’s estimated annual income shown is the product of that initial $1 million investment and the accumulation of capital appreciation plus reinvestment of all distributions of income since the inception date, multiplied by the annualized strategy yield. The strategy’s annualized yield at each listed measurement date is derived by annualizing the last dividend paid for each stock in the portfolio, and dividing that dollar amount by the price of the stock. The dividend yield for the S&P 500® Index and the NASDAQ U.S. Broad Dividend Achievers Total Return Index (DAATR) is obtained from Bloomberg for 2014 and 2015. The dividend yield is calculated using the gross dividend receipts over the prior year divided by the ending index value. This calculation is different than in prior years. The dividend yield for the DAATR was previously calculated by ThomasPartners based on the methodology recommended by the index provider. Please note that the strategy’s yield-calculation methodology may result in a higher yield than the index yield methodology because generally the dividend paying equities in the strategy will increase their dividends over the course of a 12-month period, resulting in an annualized methodology based on the last dividend paid for each stock being higher than a methodology using the actual dividends paid over the trailing 12 months. 

Returns are expressed in U.S. dollars, presented net of fees and expenses, and include the reinvestment of all income. Prior to the addition of wrap accounts beginning 6/30/2005 for Dividend Growth, and 6/30/2008 for Balanced Income, net-of-fee performance was calculated using actual management fees. After wrap accounts were added, net-of-fee performance is calculated net of actual management fees, non-bundled fee accounts, and actual bundled fees paid for bundled fee accounts. Bundled fees, which include wrap fees and all-in fees, generally include management fees, trading costs, custodian fees, and other administrative expenses.

Schwab to Acquire Thomas Partners








NewsPostsCharles SchwabSchwab to Acquire Thomas Partners 
								By Aaron Smith on October 15, 2012 at 4:50 pm							








Charles Schwab (SCHW) announced today an agreement to acquire ThomasPartners, Inc. The deal includes an $85 million upfront payment in the form of cash, and the opportunity for additional payments contingent upon future growth in assets under management. This deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
ThomasPartners is a dividend income-focused asset management firm with $2.3 billion in assets under management as of the end of September 2012. ThomasPartners has mostly growth-oriented investment portfolios designed to generate dividend income streams. ThomasPartners has consistently outperformed relevant benchmarks over the nine-year history of its dividend product.

ThomasPartners CEO Gregory Thomas, as well as his investment team led by chief investment officer William McMahon, will remain with the firm to oversee investments and portfolio management. ThomasPartners’ portfolios will be offered to Schwab retail clients. ThomasPartners’ money management solutions will be made available at a lower cost to clients of independent Registered Investment Advisors through the Schwab Advisors Services platform.  At closing Schwab will waive all transaction costs for ThomasPartners’ managed accounts custodied on Schwab’s Advisor Services platform.
ThomasPartners CEO Gregory Thomas said, “We have worked together with Schwab since 2001, with more than half our assets currently custodied on Schwab’s Advisor Services platform, and we are excited to be joining such a great company.” Schwab president Walt Bettinger said, “ThomasPartners’ dividend strategy complements Schwab’s existing asset management line-up and helps provide our clients with a more complete range of money management solutions to serve them along their investing journey.”
Schwab expects this acquisition to be neutral for EPS the first 12 months after closing. The acquisition is anticipated to begin being modestly accretive to earnings within the second 12 months.
