Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms.  At OurCrowd you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and joining the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public. 


As the graph below shows today’s biggest returns are going to private investments, and not to those who wait until a company goes public.




Almost all the returns are now privateCreate bar charts

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

“It just seems like it’s raining Aussies on us. I’ve never seen so many,” says Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd and one of Israel’s leading hi-tech venture capitalists. After a period of “clearly not enough” investment in innovation, Australia seems poised for a “really great moment”, he believes.

[Crowdfund Insider] OurCrowd’s Jon Medved: Business is Booming
OurCrowd’s co-founder and CEO Jon Medved is one of the most vocal advocates in the investment crowdfunding sector. Medved has created one of the most prominent funding marketplaces, eschewing borders and definitions to raise capital for promising early stage companies around the globe.
A best in breed crowdfunding site, OurCrowd invests in every single company that it lists on its platform – so investor interest is closely aligned. OurCrowd has garnered unique deal access, too. Smaller investors can find themselves investing alongside big name VCs like Sequoia, Khosla Ventures and perhaps Mark Cuban. This is typically pretty difficult unless you have big money or operate in Silicon Valley.

Internet Security












OverviewAt OurCrowd, ensuring data security of our clients, partners and employees is a top priority.While OurCrowd utilizes various security practices and measures to protect our clients’ confidential information, as the end user, you play an important role in safeguarding against risks related to virus attacks, unauthorized access and fraudulent online transactions. As part of our commitment to keeping your account and personal information safe and secure, we’ve compiled some best practices to help you protect yourself and to understand your role with respect to the Internet.Internet Fraud, Phishing and SpoofingPhishing is the practice of using fraudulent e-mails that appear to be from a company you have done business with and copies of legitimate websites to extract financial data and other personal information from unsuspecting computer users. Fraudsters continue to expand in sophistication and customers of financial institutions are increasingly targets of these scams. Because phishing and spoofing emails often look genuine and may appear to originate from real people, organizations, institutions and websites, the following precautions are suggested:E-mail Precautions:Just because OurCrowd is contained in an email or web address does not guarantee that it is an OurCrowd website or from an OurCrowd employee. Our emails will always be from @ourcrowd.com.Never open a website using a link provided in a suspicious e-mail. Links and the e-mail sender address can be forged. Instead, type the URL directly into the website or use your stored bookmarks.Be cautious about clicking links, opening attachments, or downloading files from e-mails regardless of file type or who sent them.Avoid including sensitive personal information in e-mail messages. A better practice is to call a company directly at the contact number you have from a reliable source or from the actual OurCrowd website, not one provided in an email.Be wary of requests that ask you to perform an urgent action (e.g., “Security Check”, “Activation”, or requests to wire funds/make payments).Be on the lookout for typos, grammatical errors, awkward writing and poor visual design and other errors, as they are often the mark of fraudulent e-mails and websites.When OurCrowd requires funds to be deposited for investments, the account will always be at a bank in the United States with no further forwarding to another account. Do not send money to OurCrowd to a non US/Israel account unless directed via secure methods on the OurCrowd site. When in doubt, call us.Online Access Precautions:Always type the official website address (URL) when logging into OurCrowd or your financial institutions.When logging into the website, check for a letter ‘s’ immediately after the “http” prefix and for the closed lock icon at the right-hand bottom of the screen. This indicates that both the site and connection are encrypted.Review websites for their privacy policies and guidance on staying safe online.Be wary of any request that asks you to disclose or verify information about yourself or your accounts, in particular, passwords or other information that a financial services provider may use to identify you (e.g. date of birth, mother's maiden name).Computer System Precautions:Keep computer software (e.g., system patches, anti-virus, and anti-spyware) up to date with the latest security patches.Contact the relevant institution immediately if you notice anything irregular with your bank account or other online accounts.If your computer and/or Internet connection appear erratic or crashes unusually during a session, disconnect the session and contact your provider’s support desk for assistance.How to Contact OurCrowdContact OurCrowd when you notice any suspicious account activity or experience any information security related events.Contact us External Sources of InformationPlease click the respective links below for further information:United StatesFederal Trade Commission (FTC)U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Israelgov.il internet safetyAustraliaaustralia.gov.au online safetyUnited KingdomPrudential Regulation Authority (PRA)Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)British Bankers' Association (BBA)

Building a Case for Investing in StartupsAfter deciding to get more involved in startup investing, the next step for a serious investor is to plan fordiversification. Diversification is a fundamental strategy for hedging risk in any asset class. Spreadinginvestments across different sectors and stages can statistically decrease structural risk and improve theROI of the overall portfolio. With OurCrowd’s Portfolio Reserve, accredited investors can easily builddiverse startup portfolios.About Portfolio ReservePortfolio Reserve is similar to a self-directed mutual fund of startups, with a few important caveats.Portfolio Reserve is a way to pre-fund an escrow account and simplify the investment process. Investorschoose a default allocation amount for new deals and maintain full discretion over their investments.Portfolio Reservists receive VIP treatment and are never put on a waiting list for oversubscribed investments.The minimum to open a Portfolio Reserve is $100k with allocations starting at $5k per company.Primary BenefitsBuild a startup investment portfolio with minimal paperwork Reserve a spot in every new investment - even the highest-demand opportunities - while retaining the right to opt out of any investment Start with a minimum $5K investment per startup for greater diversity Watch the video below to learn more about how Portfolio Reserve works. To speak to an OurCrowd representative, please fill in the form to the right.
How It Works

FAQS
How does it work?For investors seeking to build a diverse startup portfolio, Portfolio Reserve is a way to pre-fund an escrow account and simplify the investment process. Investors choose a default allocation amount for new deals and maintain full discretion over their investments.What is the minimum? The minimum to open a Portfolio Reserve is $100k. Allocations start at $5k per company.Who decides in which companies I invest, and how much I invest?Portfolio Reservists are automatically allocated into every new company in which OurCrowd invests. When an investor opens a Portfolio Reserve, they decide up front their default allocation for the investment. With proper notice, they can change this amount per investment. Do you invest in every deal? If so, how much does OurCrowd invest?OurCrowd diligences, curates, and ultimately invests in roughly 2% of the deals we see at a pace of roughly one new investment per week. We invest our own funds into each deal.Is allocation guaranteed for every deal? What about follow-on rounds?Portfolio Reservists are not automatically reserved allocations in follow-on rounds and need to inform their Investor Relations contact to opt into the investment.How long do I have to decide on a new investment?Investors have a 7-day opt-out period to decide if they do not want to participate in a new investment opportunity. Is there a difference in fees for Portfolio Reserve?No, Portfolio Reserve is a tool to simplify the investment process. Your investments are in individual companies. You can find more information on OurCrowd¹s fee structure on the website: www.ourcrowd.com. In the event of an oversubscription, what happens to my investment?Portfolio Reservists are never put on a waiting list. In the event that one of our companies is oversubscribed, Portfolio Reservists are guaranteed at least a minimum, pre-defined allocation.What if I don’t like a company?Investors can cancel the deal online or notify their Investor Relations representative by sending an email stating the preference to opt out of the particular deal. If the notification happens on a phone call or in person, the Investors Relations contact will email the verification of this request to the Portfolio Reservist. Can I increase my account later on? Yes. Once investors’ Portfolio Reserve funds have been fully allocated and deployed, they receive a notification asking whether to refill the active balance.Do I collect interest on my funds once transferred?Investor funds remain in a non-interest bearing escrow account (JP Morgan Chase) until deployment. Funds are reserved and allocated into new companies at the time of launch on the OurCrowd platform.What if I want to cancel the account?If you decide to cancel your Portfolio Reserve or would like a refund of the unallocated balance, OurCrowd will return your funds within 30 days.How does this save me time and make investing easier?You sign one set of documents and make one wire transfer. This would save you time (and money) on completing documents and wiring for individual deals. What kind of documentation do I need to provide and sign?If new to OurCrowd, there are standard documents required to complete. For Portfolio Reserve, there is one document which needs to be signed on a once-off basis. See here for the full Terms and Conditions.Still have questions? Contact us.

Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms.  At OurCrowd you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and joining the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public. 


As the graph below shows today’s biggest returns are going to private investments, and not to those who wait until a company goes public.

Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds.
