Curriculum Vita
Areas of Interest: Environmental Sociology, Development Sociology, Globalization, Food and Agriculture, Social Movements
My research examines the effects of economic globalization and neoliberal policies on social and environmental conditions for rural communities, both in the global South (particularly Latin America) and the global North.  I currently have two principal research projects.  The first focuses on the international fair trade system as an alternative model of economic exchange, examining the benefits and limitations of participation in fair trade markets for peasant commodity producers, as well as the contested politics of corporate involvement in fair trade certification and other standards-based systems. I have conducted extensive ethnographic field work in rural Mexico on certified organic and fair trade coffee production, as well as on indigenous community forestry management as a conservation/development strategy.  Second, I examine the dynamics of commodification of resources traditionally conceptualized as public goods, particularly drinking water.  My current work explores several sites of contestation over bottled water extraction and consumption in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.  Additional interests include social movements around sustainable agriculture and resource use in both North and South, and the effect of global trade/investment rules on environmental protection and regulation.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Oil-Dri Corporation of America Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to your President and CEO, Dan Jaffee.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Thank you. And welcome everybody to our second quarter and six month teleconference. I'm going to turn it over to Dan Smith. We've got Doug Graham here, and Reagan's going to do Safe Harbor as always.
Reagan B. Culbertson
Thank you, Dan. Welcome, everyone. On today's call, comments may contain Forward-Looking Statements regarding the company's performance and future periods. Actual results in those periods may materially differ.
In our press release and our SEC filings, we highlight a number of important risk factors, trends, and uncertainties that may affect our future performance. We ask that you review and consider those factors in evaluating the company's comments and in evaluating any investment in Oil-Dri stock. Thank you for joining us.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Dan let's cover the six months and quarter and then I'm sure everyone online is going to want to hear about what's coming down the road. So let's take a look back first.
Daniel T. Smith
We’ll do Dan, thank you. Good morning to everyone. Oil-Dri reported another strong quarter. Our earnings per share of $0.53 per diluted share of the second quarter were approximately 36% more than the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The quarterly results were driven by improved product mix, lower cost and higher selling prices. The positive results were partially offset by increased SG&A expenses.
The increased earnings were primarily a result of improvements in the retail and wholesale segment. Earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2016 were up over 80% from fiscal 2015. Our sales for the quarter and for the first six months were up 1% and 2% respectively over the same periods in fiscal 2015. Our gross profit margins were about 29% for the quarter and 30% for the first six months of fiscal 2016.
Improved selling prices and product mix only with lower natural gas packaging and freight cost all helped our gross margins. Our retail and wholesale team generate increased sales for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our branded and private label lightweight litters have contributed to the growth. The segment has achieved income values for the second quarter and for the first six months as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015.
The income growth was driven by favorable product mix, lower trade spending and costs. However, as we look to the second half of the fiscal year, we believe that our integrated marketing campaign for our new and improved Fresh & Light Ultimate Care lightweight cat litter will significantly increase advertising expenses and reduce earnings in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016.
B2B had a 2% sales decline but nevertheless achieved a 2% profit increase in the second quarter. The segment sales and profits were up for this first six months. Our Agsorb and Verge product lines helped drive the profit growth for both periods. The segment also benefited from lower cost.
From a balance sheet perspective our cash investment balances have grown about $6.6 million from the fiscal 2015 yearend totals. The increase was achieved despite spending over $11 million on capital, dividends and debt payments during the first six months of fiscal 2016. We paid out about $2.8 million in dividends for the first six months of fiscal 2016. Our dividend yield would be above 2.2% based on the 1-29-16 closing price of $37.50 per share and our latest quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share.

Thanks, I'll turn the meeting back over to Dan Jaffee.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Thank you Dan, and Lauren let's open up the lines for question and as always I encourage everyone to ask your most important question first and then go back to the end of the queue, so we let everybody have a chance to ask at least one question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Bair from Ascend Wealth Advisors.
John Bair
Good morning. On the road here so hopefully this comes through LA. Question on the new marketing campaign, can you tell us how long this engagement is, [Indiscernible] is it like a one year and then as kind of a parallel question with this is the contribution of part of the sales to the foundation. Can you share how long that commitment is?
Daniel S. Jaffee
I'm sorry, I heard the first part of your question, but not the second. What was the second part of your question?
John Bair
The second part was in conjunction with the partial that supported the foundation, how long of a commitment that might be, if you can share that or not yes.
Daniel S. Jaffee
That sort of well is going with the first part, but after an answer if I don't get it, just add to follow-up question. We're getting some beeping here, and I don't know why. But anyway hopefully you guys can hear the beeping. It's a multiyear deal, the goal is to have it be a real long-term partnership, I can just tell you that the Heigls have been fantastic.
I mean obviously this was something that's very near and dear to them, Jason Heigl is Katie’s brother, Nancy's son, who when he was 15-years old perished. He fell out of a back of a pickup truck and he was a lover of camping animals and they started this foundation as their star grew.
And they are as excited about partnering with Cat's Pride as we are with partnering with them. So to us, it couldn't be going any better, the goal to have it in my opinion go on forever, but to start with it’s a multiyear deal and our goal is to more than exceed their expectations, so that they are going to continue partnering with us as we move forward. Does that answer your question?
John Bair
That's great. That's commendable. And I have other questions but I'll get back in the queue.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Please don't.
John Bair
Okay.
Operator
Next question comes from [Ethan Starr] (Ph) a Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning. What are the opportunities to save money and or improve efficiency by improving the consumer products manufacturing facilities, is there a big opportunity there?
Daniel S. Jaffee
Yes, a large opportunity. As you know, we've executed a divide and conquer strategy, where Tom Cofsky is a long-term Vice President of Manufacturing is overseeing certain suite of our plans and then Aaron Christiansen has come in to oversee the reminder of the plans and then they have also divided other duties.
For instance, the raw materials which is something that’s on this intimate knowledge is underneath him, Aaron has engineering and process improvement under him and so that's really what he is focused on. We've already made a lot of improvements by those two, as I say divide and conquering, it's allowing them both to get deeper into the subjects that are under their control.
So, I'm not going to put a number on it for you but historically, I would say we've been inefficient and it makes sense, we are in our 75th anniversary and I would say for the first 70 some odd years, we were mining and processing company. Packaging really was just something we did to try and get the mining and processing we did with our customers. So a lot of time packaging came in the form of a railcar or a bulk bag or a £50 sack.
And for the last few years now, it's been putting tough that high speeds in the jugs, which is a totally different discipline. It’s nothing that we really did in the past and our team has done a phenomenal job of embracing the change and moving forward, but there are lot of best practices out there as you well know of companies that have been putting stuff in jugs at high speeds for years.

And rather than reinvent the wheel, we want to adapt and adopt those practices and so that's where Aaron comes in, he comes from P&G and Unilever, he has been in that world and he is bringing those skills to our team. So it's been a great marriage on all parts between Tom, Aaron and Mark Lewry who is the Chief Operating Officer, the whole supply chain really is functioning very well.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, I understand you don’t want to quantify things where you can already see things improving or you notice it?
Daniel S. Jaffee
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Glad to know that. I'll get back in the queue.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Thanks.
Operator
Next question comes Robert Smith from Center FPI.
Robert Smith
Good morning. Could you give us some color on how China is developing?
Daniel S. Jaffee
That’s nothing substantial, its proceeding I mean, Dan I don’t know if you want to make any comment?
Daniel T. Smith
The sales are drawing, but we're still trying to gain market share, we still have more SG&A than sales relative for the sales, because we're in a growth mode. So we're still exploring, we're still trying to grow the market.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Main products are being registered, but that's still…
Daniel T. Smith
And right now as you probably well know the China economy is slowing down a little bit too, so that's obviously impacting our business and everybody else's business.
Robert Smith
So for the quarter end declined but China was growing.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Yes, I think that's very accurate, the currency fluctuations in South America really did a number on the AML and animal health business there. So that's a good thing that China was growing because it did help or offset some of the declines we saw in South America.
Robert Smith
I see, okay, thanks a lot. I'll get back in the queue.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Alright.
Operator
Next question comes from John Bair with Ascend Wealth Advisors.
John Bair
Shed some light on, what you see happening in the agricultural market so far, I mean your press release showed that there was an increase in sales both to for quarter in the six month. Do you see that trend increasing or improving.
Daniel T. Smith
Yes, the Ag market is really difficult to predict. It kind of depends on what the formulators decide to do in terms of what they produce and they are going to look at the corn prices and things like that to really making a judgment call. So it's very difficult for them to predict their business and it's very difficult for us to predict our business. So far as you've indicated we've been strong and we hope that trend continues.
John Bair
And is that primarily domestic oriented or do these products source out to South America or other areas.
Daniel T. Smith
I would say it's mostly domestic.
John Bair
Okay. So you had a relatively mild winter conditions in the Midwest and Ag prices of course are down, but maybe cyclically things are going to pick up and maybe there is going to be higher plannings and so forth. So that was where I was trying to go with that. If there is some sort of preemptive activity if you will coming into the growing season.
Daniel T. Smith
Nothing I can immediately point at this time.
John Bair
Okay, all right, fair enough. All right, I'll get back in the queue.

Next question comes from Robert Smith from Center FPI.
Robert Smith
Yes it’s the Center for Performance Investing. So could you give us some further information on private label, lightweight penetration?
Daniel S. Jaffee
Yes, so it's interesting because it's now been on the shelf long enough where you are starting to see some sales velocity and some repeatability and some actual IRI trend data. So from a dollar share and remember historically our share of the scoopable private label market was about two. From a dollar standpoint, we have a 68% share of the private label lightweight and of the 32 we don't have, our private label lightweight partners are showing a sales velocity and unit per store per week and dollars per store per week that's more than double the competition.

Now the competition again, we were not naturally inclined to compete in heavy, because we don’t have heavy minerals. Our minerals our lighter, so in the heavy market where it's all price per pound, we were at a natural disadvantage. Now that you go to the lightweight, they are at a natural disadvantage, so what they have to do to come up with the lightweight item is take their active ingredient, which is sodium bentonite. Cut it by 40%, 50% or 60% and then fill back in a filler to make it lighter, but they are literally delivering 40% to 50% of the active ingredient.
Our private label lightweight is a 100% active ingredient. It's all calcium bentonite but no fillers added, so it's no wonder that the sales velocity has more than doubled, when consumers says anything, I mean if you were heavy or twice as much in a laundry detergent, it wouldn't have been a great innovation on the liquid concentration. Instead, it was you were able to use less and do the same number of loads.
So our partners are very happy with us. It's going very well, we're already seeing a couple of the major accounts that we didn't get right out of the gate, because they were being supplied for years by the heavy guys so they naturally went to them. They are already switching, so we're already fully switched at one account and we're sort of partially switched at another.
And so again, I would love to say we're the world's greatest salespeople and maybe we are, but in reality it gets down to the raw material, and our raw material because it's a 100% calcium bentonite, which is very absorbing, controls odors and because we have plants from the West Coast to the Midwest to the East, our freight footprint for any national account is fantastic.
So nobody can deliver a better product at a better price than we can. So to answer your question, we currently have a 68% share, I see that share growing and I see the distance between the competition expanding too. So right now I would sell them two to one, I think that's just going to continue as consumers needs our product.
Robert Smith
So then we're talking about 68% of 20%, is that...
Daniel S. Jaffee
Well ultimately 20%, yes, now you are still talking it's a nascent market, so it does not currently represent 20% of the private label scoop market yet, so it will be nice when it does. At the moment I'm looking at a share that basically represents about 1%, so could it grow 20 times, you would hope it would, but it should as consumers continue to adopt lightweight and lightweight continues to be the norm.
I mean I can tell you all the consumers I talk to, who have experienced lightweight in a positive way they will never switch back. I mean why would they ever say okay, I hear you are putting some item in there, we have our competitors are actually launching the items which is interesting, with new additives and their interesting bells and whistles and features, but you know in a 40 pound box who's bringing that home.
So I joked, when a make a lot of sales calls and I joked rather than put these additives in there they ought to put Ben Gay in there. So that when that brings it home they can actually repair their sore back. I mean who is going to buy it. So it's all playing out very well for the industry, very well for the consumer and very well for Oil-Dri.
Robert Smith
Okay. Thanks.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Thanks.
Operator
Next question comes from Ethan Starr, Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. How was your retail sell through with the Cat's Pride light weight scoopable litter is going
Daniel S. Jaffee
So the media is going to hit starting next week. So I think in sell through you are seeing now is just advanced buzz, loading up the shelves, pipeline fill and really the big read is going to come in the next 90-days. So when we're with you in 90-days to be able to look at that IRI data. It will be 30-days in arrear, so we will only have a couple of months of the data, but that's okay. That will be the real proof the efficacy of the campaign, but we are very, very excited and very optimistic of course.

Unidentified Analyst
You can’t comment on the recent past?
Daniel S. Jaffee
I mean we can but it's not relevant. You have got so many dynamic changes that it's like talking about the dead ball era versus the new ball era, the new ball is going into play next week. So I can do it for if you want, but as an investor, I know you are a big investor in Oil-Dri the biggest thing will be in 90-days.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay that's fine. Take somebody else’s question.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Yes.
Operator
Next question comes from Robert Smith.
Robert Smith
Hi, Dan. Can you give me an idea is to the level of spending in the quarter, is there any fourth quarter, I mean not at the level, but is there going to be more spending in the third quarter or would it appear than the fourth quarter?
Daniel S. Jaffee
Yes, definitely yes, because these are the key viewership times then the market tends to go a little quieter during the warmer months and then the goal is to read the data, define and refine the feedback we get from our media mix both social and TV and cable and then come back in the fall with another campaign. So the goal is to keep the snow ball rolling and keep it growing.
We are the inventors of lightweight litter as I described, we have the natural advantages and now we need the consumer to know what a great product we have. And that's why we are literally over the moon with our relationship with Katherine Heigl, I mean with her star power and her queue scores with our demographic women to 2054 are off the charts. I feel so fortunate that we are partnered with her, it could not have gone better.
Robert Smith
Dan, who is doing a creative work for you
Daniel S. Jaffee
So we have an ad agency here in Chicago called Magnani and it was their campaign, you will be seeing the TV commercials and for those of you who are can reach out there at May, I will be doing some investor road shows. I will be in New York in April, we will be doing in Boston again, we will be doing in Chicago and I'm going to bring the commercials obviously with me. So they will already be on the year, but I'll be showing you the commercials.
Next week is the Global Pet Show down in Orlando we will be unveiling in our boots on big screen TVs, all the commercials with Katie actually introducing each of them and talking about the partnership between Foundation and Cat's Pride. So we're expecting a big buzz down in Orlando next week.
Robert Smith
Thank you.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Okay.
Operator
There are no other questions at this time.
Daniel S. Jaffee
Great. Well look as I said, I mean really the company is doing very well, the margins are expanding, the strategy of creating value from solvent minerals is working. You have obviously noticed the top-line is not exploding in any way, shape or form, but the margins are expanding that's because we keep trading higher value profitable items and as we do that, we push out some of the lower value unprofitable items rather than to keep maintaining. There is no point. Otherwise, we are churning up our reserves for no benefit.
However, with this campaign you guys know that the magnitude of this category its $2.2 billion of retail, you can do the math, but any share point is the big deal and the question is how high is up? And in 90-days, I think we will have a much better feel for that than we have today. but I can tell you, we couldn't be happier from where we're seating today as we're going to hit the launch button starting what we call the Air Campaign next week.
You are going to love the TV spots, and Katie is literally, fully committed and invested to making this work and so she is going to use her - she is already using her social media power, she has got a 1.2 million Twitter followers, she has been tweeting about us. She has got 4 million Facebook likes, she has got Instagram, she has been out there on the social talking about the partnership, encouraging her royal fan base to go out and try Cat's Pride, Fresh & Light Ultimate Care, because with each sale a donation is made to the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation.

And so that's the beauty of the partnership and like I said, my absolute goal is to far exceed her and Nancy's expectations, so that they are going to absolutely want to keep the partnership going. So we'll be back here at you 90-days. Obviously, I'm always excited and enthusiastic, I'm more excited and more enthusiastic than I usually am. So thank you everybody and we will talk to you in 90-days.

at the Alumni Memorial Union - Monaghan Ballroom, a presentation of “The Power
of Culture and Ethics” was delivered by Daniel S. Jaffee, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Oil-Dri Corporation of America.


Daniel Jaffee at Marquette University


Mr. Jaffee has been the

portfolio of products help to grow and process food, raise healthy livestock,
enhance the safety of jet fuel and to keep sports fields dry and playable. 

As
CEO, Jaffee continues to focus on Oil-Dri’s long-term future growth and helped
define their mission statement: creating value from sorbent minerals. As a
result, Oil-Dri broadened its portfolio of products and innovated the first
lightweight cat litter product made of highly absorbent minerals with no
fillers, under its Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light brand.


Dr. David Krause and Nat Penn discuss Oil Dri after Jaffee's presentation


A passionate
philanthropist and animal advocate, Jaffee has been on the board of the
Anti-Cruelty Society of Chicago for 19 years, serving as chairman for three
terms. He is also a Trustee of the Chicago History Museum. Jaffee received his
B.S.B.A. from Georgetown University and his M.B.A. from the Kellogg Graduate
School of Management at Northwestern University.

Established in 1999, the
Business Leaders Forum is a speaker series sponsored by Marquette University’s
College of Business Administration. The forum provides a setting for nationally
recognized business leaders to engage in discussions and interact with students,
faculty and local business leaders. The program enables Marquette to build
practical knowledge into its rigorous business curriculum, exploring current
trends, issues and practices in business.





Marquette University has
attracted leaders at the top of their respective professions to speak at the
Business Leaders Forum, including Herbert V. Kohler, chairman, chief executive
officer and president of Kohler Co.; Richard M. Schulze, founder and chairman
of Best Buy; and James J. Mulva, chairman and CEO of ConocoPhillips. The
Kathleen and Frank Thometz Foundation has made the Business Leaders Forum
speaker series possible through a special endowment.

The AIM Program at Marquette University began in 2005. Since then over 400 undergraduate students have participated in the program. Our alumni can be found in leading asset managers and investment banks throughout the country - and the world. As the first undergraduate program partner with the CFA Institute, we take pride in our students' successful placements and CFA exam pass rates. In 2014 we added our second track: Private Equity & Investment Banking. Please feel free to contact us at: aim@marquette.edu

 Fair trade is a fast-growing alternative market intended to bring better prices and greater social justice to small farmers around the world. But is it working? This vivid study of coffee farmers in Mexico offers the first thorough investigation of the social, economic, and environmental benefits of fair trade. Based on extensive research in Zapotec indigenous communities in the state of Oaxaca, Brewing Justice follows the members of the cooperative Michiza, whose organic coffee is sold on the international fair trade market. It compares these families to conventional farming families in the same region, who depend on local middlemen and are vulnerable to the fluctuations of the world coffee market. Written in a clear and accessible style, the book carries readers into the lives of these coffee producer households and their communities, offering a nuanced analysis of both the effects of fair trade on everyday life and the limits of its impact. Brewing Justice paints a clear picture of the complex dynamics of the fair trade market and its relationship to the global economy. Drawing on interviews with dozens of fair trade leaders, the book also explores the changing politics of this international movement, including the challenges posed by the entry of transnational corporations into the fair trade system. It concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening and protecting the integrity of fair trade.

From the Inside Flap


"The idea of fair trade in a global economy is central to contemporary debates over neoliberalism, globalization and the rule of the free market. But what are the coordinates of the fair trade moment; what sort of alternative does it offer for producers and consumers? Daniel Jaffee is at once a fierce proponent of fair trade but also a critical voice. How, he asks, can fair trade coffee be in and against the market? With one foot in the Central American coffee fincas and the other in the intellectual world of Karl Polanyi and his disciples, Daniel Jaffee has on offer a very heady brew. Brewing Justice is a pioneering study of the variety of fair trade movements; a prospectus for a more radical vision of fair tradean alternative sort of market; and a vital contribution to contemporary debates over free trade, the global agro-food system and the so-called 'movement of movements'. A tour de force."Michael Watts, University of California, BerkeleyDaniel Jaffee has done the Fair Trade movement a real service in his meticulous research into the actual effect of Fair Trade on coffee farmers in a group of villages in Oaxaca, Mexico. Up till now the claims of Fair Trade benefits for the producers have been largely based on brief visits and anecdotes, but now there is hard evidence. In analysing the market for Fair Trade he distinguishes clearly between those who wish to break the market, those who would reform the market and those who simply want access to a growing market.  But his book will be of great value not only in his conclusions about how Fair Trade can be made fairer, but in extending our understanding of the overwhelming power of the giant corporations in international trade, even seeking to improve their image by cooptation and dilution of the standards when faced by the challenge of Fair Trade.” Michael Barratt Brown, author of Fair Trade: Reform and Realities in the International Trading System"It is possible to establish a global economy that is just, humane, and sustainable. But it will not be easy. The forces favoring injustice, inhumanity, and exploitation are powerful and entrenched. And, for too long, they have been supported by academics and researchers who have not bothered to examine the real costs of globalization on a standard free-trade model, let alone the real opportunities of globalization on an enlightened fair-trade model. Daniel Jaffee breaks new ground with Brewing Justice. His scholarship is stellar. His conclusions are at once realistic and inspiring. In these pages, it is possible to find the roadmap to a new and better global economy. Read them closely, embrace them, and then get to work on building a fair-trade future."John Nichols, The Nation"Brewing Justice is an impressive account of the relationships and ethics embedded in fair trade coffee. Engaging the reader in a comparative global ethnography of fair and free trade coffee production, the author evaluates the gains and losses of fair trade for Mexican peasants. Jaffee's unique accomplishment is to show the consuming public how fair trade can be realized through improving the tenuous existence of producers."Philip McMichael, author of Development and Social Change"Brewing Justice is at once a sobering account of what the fair trade movement has achieved, and an optimistic statement that only by deepening movements like this one, will society advance in the direction of economic democracy and justice."Gerardo Otero, professor of sociology and Latin American Studies, Simon Fraser University"Brewing Justice is not just a study of fair trade coffee. It also provides alternatives to the unfair rules of trade imposed by the WTO. And it shows that we can all play a role in shaping the economy. Drinking coffee is a political act."Vandana Shiva, author of Earth Democracy

N. Andersonon December 11, 2007Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis is a stunning book.  Written by a sociologist, it combines the best of anthropology, sociology, and economics to produce a work that transcends all of them and makes major contributions to the literature on social justice and on development.The core of it is a detailed study of the fall of coffee prices and the consequent rise of fair trade coffee-buying in Oaxaca, Mexico.  Oaxaca was an ideal choice because it is an impoverished area that produces very good coffee, and because Mexico was particularly hard hit by the world meltdown in coffee prices in the 1990s.  Oaxaca can now claim that much of its coffee is fair trade, organic, and shade grown, to say nothing of being a fine drink.  Thus it can command a relatively good price that keeps the small producers there alive--barely.  Jaffee not only describes the coffee economy; he shows, from a wonderful village study, how it relates to maize agriculture, labor out-migration, forest conservation, and other important aspects of life.  The shade-grown coffee plantations of south Mexico are incredible wildlife paradises--a birdwatcher's mad dream of heaven--and are absolutely critical not only for the survival of Mexican birds but of migrants from the rest of North America as well.Jaffee seems not to know just how bad Mexican coffee was in the old days of state control of the coffee economy.  The state saw fit, in many cases, to push mass production of low-grade coffee, trying to compete with Brazil.  This failed.  The free market came and wrecked the economy, but it did what competition is supposed to do:  it improved the coffee, and provided better markets for what was already good.  It also had the sad effect of driving many producers of low-grade coffee out of the field and into dire poverty.  This problem remains with us.Somewhat more important is Jaffee's stress on the more general problems of the "free market" economy and "neoliberalism."  He blames this for the worldwide woes of commodity production.  I do not read the evidence quite the same way.  As he points out, the world coffee trade is really dominated by five huge multinational firms (like Nestle) and a few more smallish ones (like Starbucks).  These firms are supported by various direct and indirect subsidies, and get various other special favors.  An oligopoly, especially when maintained by government action to some extent, is not a free market!  He also shows that the dominance of First World buyers over Third World producers of coffee and other commodities has been maintained by war, subversion, and other ugly procedures that are the absolute antithesis of the free market.  The fact is--as most Third World countries and a few First World scholars (like Aihwa Ong) now realize--that the world under "neoliberalism" has, if anything, even more neocolonial governmental control and manipulation than before.  First World interests have forced their idea of "free markets" on the poor nations, but have kept the subsidies for their home folks, to say nothing of such exercises in "free marketing" as the US invasion of Iraq, forthrightly called by Alan Greenspan a "war for oil."  I have no vested interest in free markets per se, but I don't think they are the whole problem here.That said, Jaffee is certainly correct in saying that we need much more fair trade in coffee, and that it will take work--neither First World strongarming nor free marketing, but actual reform of trade.  He gives a number of very valuable and practical recommendations, including protection of the term "fair trade" from misuse and cooptation.Readers, this is one place you can REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  I have seen Mexico's small-scale coffee production and studied it, and I think the situation is really night and day.  INSIST on shade-grown, organic, fair trade coffee!  Seek it out!  Even if the label is somewhat weaseled, as Jaffee correctly shows it often is, your insistence sends a clear message.  Recently there has been a major decline in "ordinary" coffee consumption but a spectacular rise in demand for fair trade and organic coffee.  The firms cannot ignore that.More generally:  Anyone interested in current problems of small-scale agriculture--whether coffee, potatoes, or cattle--should read this book.Read more0Comment|

Well doneRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsLife in the Mountains of Central AmericaByBrad Allenon February 2, 2010Format: PaperbackDaniel Jaffee's book is about much more than coffee.  It is a detailed look into the lives of people living in the mountains of southern Mexico.  I have been involved with a village in the mountains of Nicaragua for 3 years where the people also grow coffee along with staple food crops.  Mr. Jaffee gets all of the details right and adds a myriad more.  It is worth digging into his statistics, they truly help understanding the situation, the people, and their lives.  Little can compare with the impact of 29% and 42% on page 170 (the percentage of people in two categories who do not always have adequate food for their children).  He does not overdo it though, and gives the social impacts of the economic situations both locally and world-wide that drive these peoples' lives.The free vs. fair trade discussion will make anyone think.  The book starts down a path of pushing fair trade over free trade but the more I read and digested the situation the more I tended back to free trade.  It is a rare book that can so tie the chain of economic events from a poor farmer in Oaxaca to my morning cup of coffee.  But even more so, I start to see many ways that we shape the world and even more where there is a shape I have no control over.  In the end, I will buy certified organic fair-trade coffee and support free trade in the Americas.  Life is complicated.Few books have taught me so much.Read more0Comment|

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year?

When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not.

Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student.

Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
