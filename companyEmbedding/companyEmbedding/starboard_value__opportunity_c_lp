NEW YORK, April 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered a letter to President and CEO, Jim Schoeneck, and the Depomed Board of Directors. 
The full text of the letter follows:








April 8, 2016
Depomed, Inc.   7999 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 300   Newark, CA 94560   Attn: Jim Schoeneck, President and Chief Executive Officer  
cc: Board of Directors
Dear Jim,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), has an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and that significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that should be within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board").  However, we are highly concerned regarding a number of actions that the Board has taken which indicate to us that meaningful change is needed to ensure the Company is acting in the best interest of all shareholders.  Specifically, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  In combination, these concerns lead us to believe that management and the Board may be more interested in entrenching themselves than in delivering maximum value for all shareholders.
As we will discuss in this letter and subsequent materials, yesterday we delivered to the Company the documentation required under Depomed's bylaws to request that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice").  We understand that we are taking extraordinary actions and are doing so because of our serious concerns with the Board's recent actions and long history of shareholder-unfriendly tactics.   
We acquired our position in Depomed because we believe that the Company is substantially undervalued and opportunities exist to create significant value for shareholders.  This includes an opportunity to improve capital deployment, rationalize research and development, and explore a potential sale of the Company given potential operating, financial, and tax synergies.  However, while still acquiring our position, Depomed filed preliminary proxy materials for the upcoming annual meeting with a proposal to change the Company's state of incorporation from California to Delaware (the "Reincorporation Proposal").  Upon further review, we identified unconventional provisions that indicate management and the Board are using the Reincorporation Proposal as a tactic to further entrench themselves by suppressing shareholder rights that currently exist under Depomed-California.  This is just the latest egregious example of poor corporate governance and entrenchment by this Board.  Apparently, it was not enough for the current Board to unilaterally adopt onerous and shareholder-unfriendly special meeting bylaw provisions in July 2015, as part of its efforts to fend off an unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company from Horizon Pharma plc ("Horizon").  Now, under the guise of the Reincorporation Proposal, the Board is attempting to:
(i) Increase the solicitation requirement to call a special meeting from 10% of the voting power, as it currently stands under California law, to 25% of the voting power, as would be required under Depomed-Delaware's bylaws; and
(ii) Eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting to remove and replace current Board members; and
(iii) Prevent shareholders, for all practical purposes, from commencing a special meeting request process within 180 days of any Annual Meeting; and
(iv) Obtain the sole discretion and authority to effect the Delaware reincorporation at any time prior to the 2017 Annual Meeting.
These are not typical or standard provisions that would reasonably be included in such a reincorporation proposal.  These appear to be carefully crafted provisions with the specific intention of further limiting shareholder rights.  In addition, Depomed conveniently failed to disclose some of these material provisions in the Reincorporation Proposal section of its preliminary proxy and instead chose to bury these significant entrenchment provisions in Appendices D and E towards the very end of the proxy.  We intend to vigorously oppose the current version of the Reincorporation Proposal, and we advise other shareholders to fully consider these provisions and the significant ramifications they would have on shareholder rights.
Unfortunately, these shareholder-unfriendly tactics are just the latest attempts by the current Board to further entrench themselves.  The Board took similar actions following Horizon's unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company.  Specifically, on July 7, 2015, the Company received an unsolicited offer from Horizon to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Depomed in an all-stock transaction for $29.25 per share, which represented a 42% premium to the closing price of $20.64 per share on July 6, 2015.  At the time, this $29.25 per share offer price would have represented an all-time high stock price for the Company, and compares to the current Depomed stock price of $15.00 per share as of yesterday's close.
Rather than engage with Horizon in an attempt to negotiate a value-maximizing transaction, on July 12, 2015, the Board adopted bylaw amendments, as well as a 10% poison pill rights plan (the "Poison Pill"), designed to make it as difficult and time-consuming as possible for shareholders to potentially have a say on Horizon's offer at a special meeting.  Nevertheless, Horizon proceeded to comply with the arduous steps under the special meeting bylaw amendments in order to give shareholders a voice on its offer.  Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass, Lewis & Co. ("Glass Lewis"), two leading proxy advisory firms, expressed concerns about Depomed's shareholder-unfriendly bylaw amendments and Poison Pill, and supported Horizon's efforts to call a special meeting to remove and replace the Board, noting:
"Given that the poison pill and unilateral bylaw amendments adopted by the Depomed board materially impact shareholder rights, shareholders should provide consent FOR the special meeting requests." – ISS, September 26, 2015
"[i]n this case, [Glass Lewis] believe[s] it would be in the best interests of [Depomed] shareholders to consent to the calling of the Removal and Bylaw Amendments Special Meeting and the Election Special Meeting so that the merits of the underlying issues can be more carefully evaluated." – Glass Lewis, September 28, 2015
In early August 2015, Horizon's merger subsidiary filed a lawsuit against Depomed and the Board, seeking to invalidate the bylaw amendments and the Poison Pill under California law and alleging that the Board members had breached their fiduciary duties.  That same day, Depomed filed a lawsuit against Horizon alleging, among other things, a breach of contract and other violations of California law by Horizon based on Horizon's possession and misuse of confidential information it obtained from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Janssen") under a confidentiality agreement.  Depomed moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent Horizon from continuing with its offer to acquire Depomed based on Horizon's alleged misuse of confidential information, which the court granted on November 19, 2015.  Despite the onerous bylaw requirements, Horizon was close to submitting the requisite consents for calling the special meeting in mid-November 2015.  Following the court decision, however, Horizon withdrew its then-increased offer of $33.00 per share.  Depomed stock reached a high of $33.74 on July 21, 2015 following Horizon's final offer.  Since then, Depomed's stock price has declined 56%, resulting in significant losses for shareholders.
In addition to the decline in Depomed's share price, shareholders are continuing to pay for the Company's ill-advised lawsuit against Horizon.  In 2015, Depomed paid approximately $11.9 million in legal fees associated with the defense of Horizon.  Shareholders are still paying the Company's legal fees as Depomed continues a lawsuit that appears to have more to do with management and the Board's self-preservation than protecting the best interests of shareholders.  We see no legitimate rationale for the Board's continued insistence in proceeding with a lawsuit that deprives shareholders of the potential for an approach by a strategic acquirer.  This lawsuit sets a terrible precedent for potential future value creation, and significantly undermines the rights of Depomed shareholders.
This Company has a troubling record of manipulating Depomed's corporate machinery to entrench management and the Board.  This was clearly evident throughout Horizon's attempt to acquire the Company and has become even more evident with regard to Depomed's latest attempt to eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to seek the removal of Board members at a special meeting under the guise of a Delaware reincorporation. 
Given the apparent willingness of the current Board members to take extraordinary action to entrench themselves, as exemplified by the Reincorporation Proposal, we have little choice at this time but to immediately commence the process to call a special meeting of shareholders in order to preserve our rights under California law and Depomed's current bylaws.  Therefore, yesterday, we delivered to the Company the documentation required under Depomed's bylaws to request that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice").  Depomed's onerous special meeting bylaws require that we put forth our slate of director candidates as part of this initial step in commencing the special meeting process.
Given that the Reincorporation Proposal was publicly disclosed only three days ago on April 5, 2016, and our view that the members of the Board will go to any length to entrench themselves, out of an abundance of caution, we are immediately nominating six individuals, five of whom are Starboard Value investment professionals.  We intend to continue our search for a slate of director candidates that will ensure an experienced, diverse, and independent board, as has been our practice when proposing alternative board slates over the past fourteen years.  However, we deemed it necessary to take this action to preserve our rights as shareholders, and to ensure compliance with Depomed's current onerous bylaw requirements, so that management cannot further manipulate the bylaws prior to our ability to take action.
We are taking this extraordinary action because we cannot risk that the current Board may seek to further manipulate Depomed's bylaws to prevent a lawful special meeting request.  We caution the Board against taking any steps in response to our special meeting Record Date Request Notice to further diminish or suppress the rights of its shareholders to call a special meeting under California law and the Company's bylaws.
We have an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed because we believe that significant opportunities exist to create value through better execution, improved capital allocation, and, potentially, a sale of the Company.  We hope to have a constructive dialogue with the Company, but need to make sure that shareholders' interests remain of paramount importance.  As such, we fully expect that management and the Board will halt their pattern of aggressive entrenchment behavior and take no action to further frustrate shareholders' rights. Additionally, despite recent rhetoric from management to the contrary, we believe that Depomed should not be contemplating acquisitions at this time given its levered capital structure and expensive debt.
To be clear, we are not currently advocating for any one particular transaction, or any transaction at all, but we firmly believe that board change is necessary to best represent the interests of all shareholders as it relates to the ongoing business and any potential transaction opportunities in the future.  Given your actions, and history of actions, we cannot take the risk that you further impair our shareholder rights.  We intend to share more details with shareholders in the coming weeks regarding our views on the Company, opportunities for value creation, and Depomed's significant corporate governance deficiencies.
Best Regards,

NEW YORK, May 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a Special Meeting of Depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current Depomed Board of Directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees.
The full text of the letter follows:








May 26, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), currently has an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  
We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders. Unfortunately, as we outlined in our previous letter to Depomed on April 8th, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed. We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
To that end, we will be delivering to Depomed today a new written request, in accordance with Depomed's Bylaws, that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice") for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current Board. This Record Date Request Notice supersedes our initial request delivered to Depomed, dated April 7, 2016 (the "Initial Record Date Request Notice").  As you may recall, the Initial Record Date Request Notice was delivered to Depomed in order to preserve our rights under California law and mitigate the risk that Depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights.
Since delivering the Initial Record Date Request Notice, we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highly-qualified nominees that included the evaluation of over 100 qualified potential candidates. We have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise. Collectively, our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards. Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the special meeting, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.
We appreciate that the Board promptly set a record date in response to our Initial Record Date Request Notice, thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders. While we also appreciate the Board's intentions in amending its 10% poison pill rights plan ("Poison Pill") to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting, there are other considerations as a 13D filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other Depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation. Therefore, today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the SEC in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request. Our expectation is that the Board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this Record Date Request Notice as it did with our Initial Record Date Request Notice, and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future.
We are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly well-qualified to serve as directors of Depomed. We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees below. Over the coming weeks and months, we intend to share our detailed views on Depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the special meeting of shareholders.

The following constitutes Amendment No. 6 to the Schedule 13D filed by the undersigned (“Amendment No. 6”).  This Amendment No. 6 amends the Schedule 13D as specifically set forth herein.
 




Item 3.


Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.



 
Item 3 is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
 
The Shares purchased by each of Starboard V&O Fund, Starboard S LLC and Starboard CLP and held in the Starboard Value LP Account were purchased with working capital (which may, at any given time, include margin loans made by brokerage firms in the ordinary course of business) in open market purchases, except as otherwise noted, as set forth in Schedule A, which is incorporated by reference herein.  The aggregate purchase price of the 2,413,587 Shares beneficially owned by Starboard V&O Fund is approximately $65,224,686, excluding brokerage commissions.  The aggregate purchase price of the 551,675 Shares beneficially owned by Starboard S LLC is approximately $15,649,040, excluding brokerage commissions. The aggregate purchase price of the 302,698 Shares beneficially owned by Starboard C LP is approximately $8,269,334, excluding brokerage commissions.

Item 4.


Purpose of Transaction.



 
Item 4 is hereby amended to add the following:
 

Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, “Starboard”) has undertaken the sales reported in this Amendment No. 6 to the Schedule 13D in large part to effectuate a rebalancing of Starboard’s portfolio in light of the significant appreciation in the Issuer’s stock price since Starboard filed its initial Schedule13D in the Issuer more than a year and a half ago. The Shares sold by the Reporting Persons represent approximately 14% of the Reporting Persons’ total equity position in the Issuer.  Starboard intends to remain a large shareholder of the Issuer, and Mr. Feld continues as an active member of the Issuer’s Board of Directors.
 





Item 5.


Interest in Securities of the Issuer.



 
Items 5(a)-(c) are hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
 
The aggregate percentage of Shares reported owned by each person named herein is based upon 49,887,141 Shares outstanding, as of October 24, 2016, which is the total number of Shares outstanding as reported in the Issuer’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2016.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Starboard Delivers Letter To Depomed ShareholdersHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Starboard Delivers Letter To Depomed ShareholdersPR NewswireJuly 26, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders. The full text of the letter follows:July 26, 2016Dear Fellow Shareholders,Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard") and director nominees, currently owns approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders.As we outlined in our May 26th letter to Depomed shareholders, we delivered a written request to Depomed, in accordance with its Bylaws, that the Board set a record date (the "Record Date Request Notice") for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders (the "Special Meeting") for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current Board.  This Record Date Request Notice superseded our initial request delivered to Depomed, dated April 7, 2016 (the "Initial Record Date Request Notice").  As you may recall, the Initial Record Date Request Notice was delivered to Depomed in order to preserve our rights to call a special meeting under California law and mitigate the risk that Depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights.  Given the Board's disturbing history of taking actions aimed at limiting shareholder rights, we simply could not afford to take any risks.We continue to have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.Following our initial evaluation of well over 100 qualified potential board candidates, we have continued to meet with numerous pharmaceutical executives to supplement our slate with additional pharmaceutical experience.  Unfortunately, given the extensive requirements and restrictions under the Depomed Bylaws for calling the Special Meeting, the addition of any new, highly qualified nominees to our slate at this time would effectively require us to submit a new record date request notice to Depomed, thereby restarting the clock under the Bylaws for the Special Meeting and further delaying our efforts to remove and replace the Board.  Further delay is unpalatable; therefore, we have instead appointed two exceptionally qualified former senior pharmaceutical executives – Robert G. Savage and James L. Tyree – as advisors to assist in our solicitation efforts given their significant industry knowledge and experience.  If our Special Meeting solicitation ultimately proves successful, we would invite Messrs. Savage and Tyree to join the Board, and they have indicated their desire to do so.As a brief background, Mr. Savage was the former Worldwide Chairman for the Pharmaceuticals Group at Johnson & Johnson where he was responsible for one of the world's largest pharmaceutical organizations with annual sales of almost $15 billion in 2001.  Mr. Tyree was the former Executive Vice President, Pharmaceutical Products at Abbott Laboratories with annual Pharmaceutical Products division sales of almost $20 billion in 2010.  We are confident that you will find Messrs. Savage and Tyree to be incredibly well-qualified to serve as directors of Depomed given their extensive experience as senior executives of multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical divisions at two of the world's largest and most well-respected healthcare companies.  They supplement what we already believe to be an exceptional slate of Board nominees who collectively possess a proven track record of corporate governance best practices and shareholder value creation.  We believe that, together, our advisors and current Board nominees would create an all-star Board that would work diligently and collaboratively to protect and represent the best interests of shareholders.Read MoreIn addition, in order to maintain a degree of continuity amidst the required change that we believe is desperately needed at Depomed, in the event that the current Board is removed and our nominees are elected at the Special Meeting, the new Board would be willing to increase the size of the Board to nine members (currently there are six members; adding Mr. Savage and Mr. Tyree would expand the Board to eight members) and add back one incumbent director.  As a reminder, we utilized this construct successfully at Darden Restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board members.Today, we are also announcing that we will proceed with our original solicitation to call the Special Meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under Depomed's Bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least 10% of Depomed's outstanding shares entitled to vote.  The Company has set a record date of August 19, 2016 (the "Record Date"), for determining the shareholders entitled to provide their written request to call the Special Meeting.  Following the Record Date, Starboard will have up to 30 days to deliver the written requests to Depomed along with the other information required under the Bylaws, including the date Starboard would like to set for holding the Special Meeting (the "Special Meeting Notice"), which cannot be less than 35 nor more than 60 days after Starboard submits the Special Meeting Notice. Following Depomed's receipt of our Initial Record Date Request Notice on April 7, 2016, the Board responded promptly by setting a record date for April 26th, or less than three weeks later.  Depomed knew that our Initial Record Date Request Notice was a placeholder and that we would be revising our slate of nominees, which under Depomed's onerous Bylaw provisions, would require that we submit a new record date request notice.  On May 26, 2016, we delivered the new Record Date Request Notice with our updated Board slate.  However, in yet another sign of entrenchment, this time the Board responded by setting a record date of August 19, 2016, or close to three months later.  Shareholders should know that the Board delayed the record date to almost the full extent it is permitted to delay such an action under its Bylaws.  This is in stark contrast to the commentary from Depomed to shareholders on April 25, 2016:"Depomed believes that the selection of an early meeting date is in the best interest of Depomed and its shareholders.  Based upon Starboard's stated goals of making this an efficient process and its stated need to immediately bring to a vote the replacement of the entire Board, we encourage you and your advisors to work collaboratively with us to hold the Special Meeting as soon as possible."-          Jim SchoeneckApparently, when the Company realized that we had assembled a highly qualified slate, they no longer wished to hold the meeting as soon as possible.  This is yet another example of the Board attempting to disenfranchise shareholders and further entrench itself and bares an eerie resemblance to the delay tactics that Depomed used against Horizon Pharma plc ("Horizon") during Horizon's failed acquisition proposal of Depomed.  As you may recall, Depomed filed a lawsuit attempting to permanently enjoin Horizon from ever being able to acquire Depomed.We see the Board's rationale of basing the prolonged meeting date on the NUCYNTA litigation as a classic "bait-and-switch."  Upon our first placeholder nomination, there was no mention of delaying the Special Meeting until the outcome of the pending NUCYNTA patent litigation.  However, the most recent letter from Depomed to its shareholders details, "Depomed believes the Company's shareholders should know the outcome of the NUCYNTA patent litigation, clarifying the patent exclusivity of the Company's most important asset."  We believe that this stated reason for delaying the Special Meeting is completely disingenuous.Given our ownership stake, and that calling the Special Meeting would only require one shareholder to consent, we have decided, at this point, to control the timing of the Special Meeting.  We will proceed with our SEC-compliant solicitation process to ensure that shareholders have their voices heard and to prevent Depomed from any further attempts to manipulate our Special Meeting process and disenfranchise shareholders with needless stratagems.  We have concluded that this is the best course of action given our overwhelming lack of confidence that the Board will engage in a good-faith and expeditious manner.As we continue to progress towards the Special Meeting, we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be the new board of directors of Depomed, including our highly qualified advisors who would be added to the board if we are successful.  We believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise.  Collectively, our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards.  Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the Special Meeting, together with our highly qualified advisors, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.  We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below.  Over the coming weeks, we intend to share our detailed views on Depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the Special Meeting.Highlights of Starboard's Nominees' and Advisors' Biographies (in alphabetical order):John J.
