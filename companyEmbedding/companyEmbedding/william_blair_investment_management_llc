History
Founding and early years
William Blair & Company opened on January 8, 1935, as Blair, Bonner & Co. The firm was founded by William M. Blair and Francis A. Bonner who had worked together at investment firm Lee, Higginson & Co., prior to its collapse in 1932-1933.
In its early days, it assisted the growth of the Household Finance Corporation, Continental Casualty and Continental Assurance companies (today CNA Insurance). The firm focused on raising capital, primarily for midwestern growth-oriented companies, through its own originated issues rather than distribute securities for larger Wall Street-based investment banks.
In 1941 Bonner left the company, and it was renamed William Blair & Company. In 1946 Blair's sons, William McCormick Blair, Jr., Edward McCormick Blair and Bowen Blair joined the firm. Blair, Sr. stepped down as managing partner in 1961, and handed the reins over to his son Edward. William M. Blair remained a senior partner of William Blair & Co. until his death in 1982 (age 97).
Under Edward Blair and Edgar D. Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.
Growth and development
In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically. Between 1991 and 1996 William Blair & Company lead managed or co-managed 196 equity underwriting transactions representing $13.6 billion in capital. William Blair & Company also expanded its debt finance services, becoming active in bond financing and bond trading. The firm continued to serve traditional debt-issuing clients such as private corporations and states, counties, municipalities and school districts while expanding this client base to encompass healthcare facilities, institutions of higher learning and transportation authorities. The firm also earned a growing national reputation for successfully floating bonds for cultural institutions.[citation needed]
Recent years
In 1995 the firm opened a Zurich office, followed in 1996 by a San Francisco office, and in 1999 by a new office in Hartford. William Blair also expanded its international presence by increasing the size of its Tokyo and London offices. In August 2006, William Blair opened an institutional sales and trading office in downtown Boston, as part of an effort to locate in regions with a high concentration of clients. In 2007, the firm opened a new representative office in Shanghai and another institutional sales office in New York.[1]
In 2017, William Blair's Chicago headquarters will move to 150 N. Riverside Plaza. The new headquarters will be Sustainability LEED-CS Gold Pre-certified with a maximization of open space, 1.5-acre park, plus 100% green roof.[2]
Business overview
Investment banking
William Blair's investment banking group focuses on high-growth companies, executing advisory and financing services such as mergers and acquisitions, public equity offerings, and private capital raises. From 2010 to 2014, the investment banking group completed more than 330 M&A transactions, worth a total of $73 billion in value.[3]
These deals involved parties in 36 countries and five continents; nearly one-third of all transactions were cross-border. During that same period, the firm was an underwriter on more than 20 percent of all U.S. initial public offerings and raised nearly $100 billion in public and private financing.
Equity research
The firm is also known for its equity research unit, which was named the "Most Trusted Research" in Greenwich Associates' 2014 survey of small and mid-cap portfolio managers. In the 2015 survey, William Blair ranked No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 in nine categories.[4]
Asset management and institutional sales

William Blair Capital Partners




William Blair Capital Partners logo


Main article: Chicago Growth Partners
Founded in 1982, William Blair Capital Partners was the investment arm of William Blair & Company. During the 1980s, WBCP was an active investor in leveraged buyout transactions.
In 2004, the principals of William Blair Capital Partners completed a spinout from William Blair to form Chicago Growth Partners, a private equity firm focusing on investments in growth capital and leveraged buyouts of lower middle market growth companies.[5] The primary motivation for the departure of the Chicago Growth Partners team from William Blair was to gain access to a more diversified base of institutional investors that was limited by the group's involvement with the investment bank.
In August 2006, the remaining partners of William Blair Capital Partners suspended efforts to raise William Blair Capital Partners VIII, which had been reportedly targeted at about $250 million. The remaining team left William Blair to found a new private equity firm, Seyen Capital.[6]
Office locations
The bank operates from 16 cities across 5 continents.

History
Founding and early years
William Blair & Company opened on January 8, 1935, as Blair, Bonner & Co. The firm was founded by William M. Blair and Francis A. Bonner who had worked together at investment firm Lee, Higginson & Co., prior to its collapse in 1932-1933.
In its early days, it assisted the growth of the Household Finance Corporation, Continental Casualty and Continental Assurance companies (today CNA Insurance). The firm focused on raising capital, primarily for midwestern growth-oriented companies, through its own originated issues rather than distribute securities for larger Wall Street-based investment banks.
In 1941 Bonner left the company, and it was renamed William Blair & Company. In 1946 Blair's sons, William McCormick Blair, Jr., Edward McCormick Blair and Bowen Blair joined the firm. Blair, Sr. stepped down as managing partner in 1961, and handed the reins over to his son Edward. William M. Blair remained a senior partner of William Blair & Co. until his death in 1982 (age 97).
Under Edward Blair and Edgar D. Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.
Growth and development
In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically. Between 1991 and 1996 William Blair & Company lead managed or co-managed 196 equity underwriting transactions representing $13.6 billion in capital. William Blair & Company also expanded its debt finance services, becoming active in bond financing and bond trading. The firm continued to serve traditional debt-issuing clients such as private corporations and states, counties, municipalities and school districts while expanding this client base to encompass healthcare facilities, institutions of higher learning and transportation authorities. The firm also earned a growing national reputation for successfully floating bonds for cultural institutions.[citation needed]
Recent years
In 1995 the firm opened a Zurich office, followed in 1996 by a San Francisco office, and in 1999 by a new office in Hartford. William Blair also expanded its international presence by increasing the size of its Tokyo and London offices. In August 2006, William Blair opened an institutional sales and trading office in downtown Boston, as part of an effort to locate in regions with a high concentration of clients. In 2007, the firm opened a new representative office in Shanghai and another institutional sales office in New York.[1]
In 2017, William Blair's Chicago headquarters will move to 150 N. Riverside Plaza. The new headquarters will be Sustainability LEED-CS Gold Pre-certified with a maximization of open space, 1.5-acre park, plus 100% green roof.[2]
Business overview
Investment banking
William Blair's investment banking group focuses on high-growth companies, executing advisory and financing services such as mergers and acquisitions, public equity offerings, and private capital raises. From 2010 to 2014, the investment banking group completed more than 330 M&A transactions, worth a total of $73 billion in value.[3]
These deals involved parties in 36 countries and five continents; nearly one-third of all transactions were cross-border. During that same period, the firm was an underwriter on more than 20 percent of all U.S. initial public offerings and raised nearly $100 billion in public and private financing.
Equity research
The firm is also known for its equity research unit, which was named the "Most Trusted Research" in Greenwich Associates' 2014 survey of small and mid-cap portfolio managers. In the 2015 survey, William Blair ranked No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 in nine categories.[4]
Asset management and institutional sales
William Blair is a long-term partner to institutional and individual investors around the globe, with more than $72 billion in client assets through customized portfolios, separately managed accounts, mutual funds, SICAVs, and retail accounts. Using a disciplined research process, William Blair provides institutional investors active management across the market-capitalization spectrum in U.S., international, and global markets.
William Blair Capital Partners




William Blair Capital Partners logo


Main article: Chicago Growth Partners
Founded in 1982, William Blair Capital Partners was the investment arm of William Blair & Company. During the 1980s, WBCP was an active investor in leveraged buyout transactions.
In 2004, the principals of William Blair Capital Partners completed a spinout from William Blair to form Chicago Growth Partners, a private equity firm focusing on investments in growth capital and leveraged buyouts of lower middle market growth companies.[5] The primary motivation for the departure of the Chicago Growth Partners team from William Blair was to gain access to a more diversified base of institutional investors that was limited by the group's involvement with the investment bank.
In August 2006, the remaining partners of William Blair Capital Partners suspended efforts to raise William Blair Capital Partners VIII, which had been reportedly targeted at about $250 million. The remaining team left William Blair to found a new private equity firm, Seyen Capital.[6]

Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.
Growth and development
In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically. Between 1991 and 1996 William Blair & Company lead managed or co-managed 196 equity underwriting transactions representing $13.6 billion in capital. William Blair & Company also expanded its debt finance services, becoming active in bond financing and bond trading. The firm continued to serve traditional debt-issuing clients such as private corporations and states, counties, municipalities and school districts while expanding this client base to encompass healthcare facilities, institutions of higher learning and transportation authorities. The firm also earned a growing national reputation for successfully floating bonds for cultural institutions.[citation needed]
Recent years
In 1995 the firm opened a Zurich office, followed in 1996 by a San Francisco office, and in 1999 by a new office in Hartford. William Blair also expanded its international presence by increasing the size of its Tokyo and London offices. In August 2006, William Blair opened an institutional sales and trading office in downtown Boston, as part of an effort to locate in regions with a high concentration of clients. In 2007, the firm opened a new representative office in Shanghai and another institutional sales office in New York.[1]
In 2017, William Blair's Chicago headquarters will move to 150 N. Riverside Plaza. The new headquarters will be Sustainability LEED-CS Gold Pre-certified with a maximization of open space, 1.5-acre park, plus 100% green roof.[2]

From 2010 to 2014, the investment banking group completed more than 330 M&A transactions, worth a total of $73 billion in value.[3]
These deals involved parties in 36 countries and five continents; nearly one-third of all transactions were cross-border. During that same period, the firm was an underwriter on more than 20 percent of all U.S. initial public offerings and raised nearly $100 billion in public and private financing.

Main article: Chicago Growth Partners
Founded in 1982, William Blair Capital Partners was the investment arm of William Blair & Company. During the 1980s, WBCP was an active investor in leveraged buyout transactions.
In 2004, the principals of William Blair Capital Partners completed a spinout from William Blair to form Chicago Growth Partners, a private equity firm focusing on investments in growth capital and leveraged buyouts of lower middle market growth companies.[5] The primary motivation for the departure of the Chicago Growth Partners team from William Blair was to gain access to a more diversified base of institutional investors that was limited by the group's involvement with the investment bank.
In August 2006, the remaining partners of William Blair Capital Partners suspended efforts to raise William Blair Capital Partners VIII, which had been reportedly targeted at about $250 million. The remaining team left William Blair to found a new private equity firm, Seyen Capital.[6]

History
Founding and early years
William Blair & Company opened on January 8, 1935, as Blair, Bonner & Co. The firm was founded by William M. Blair and Francis A. Bonner who had worked together at investment firm Lee, Higginson & Co., prior to its collapse in 1932-1933.
In its early days, it assisted the growth of the Household Finance Corporation, Continental Casualty and Continental Assurance companies (today CNA Insurance). The firm focused on raising capital, primarily for midwestern growth-oriented companies, through its own originated issues rather than distribute securities for larger Wall Street-based investment banks.
In 1941 Bonner left the company, and it was renamed William Blair & Company. In 1946 Blair's sons, William McCormick Blair, Jr., Edward McCormick Blair and Bowen Blair joined the firm. Blair, Sr. stepped down as managing partner in 1961, and handed the reins over to his son Edward. William M. Blair remained a senior partner of William Blair & Co. until his death in 1982 (age 97).
Under Edward Blair and Edgar D. Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.

In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically. Between 1991 and 1996 William Blair & Company lead managed or co-managed 196 equity underwriting transactions representing $13.6 billion in capital. William Blair & Company also expanded its debt finance services, becoming active in bond financing and bond trading. The firm continued to serve traditional debt-issuing clients such as private corporations and states, counties, municipalities and school districts while expanding this client base to encompass healthcare facilities, institutions of higher learning and transportation authorities. The firm also earned a growing national reputation for successfully floating bonds for cultural institutions.[citation needed]
Recent years
In 1995 the firm opened a Zurich office, followed in 1996 by a San Francisco office, and in 1999 by a new office in Hartford. William Blair also expanded its international presence by increasing the size of its Tokyo and London offices. In August 2006, William Blair opened an institutional sales and trading office in downtown Boston, as part of an effort to locate in regions with a high concentration of clients. In 2007, the firm opened a new representative office in Shanghai and another institutional sales office in New York.[1]
In 2017, William Blair's Chicago headquarters will move to 150 N. Riverside Plaza. The new headquarters will be Sustainability LEED-CS Gold Pre-certified with a maximization of open space, 1.5-acre park, plus 100% green roof.[2]

About William Blair Posts
No William Blair post published on any social media platform is an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any William Blair investment product to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction. Additionally, all William Blair posts published on any social media platform are for informational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advice or recommendations to invest in any particular security, strategy or investment product. 
William Blair posts on social media may include statements concerning financial market trends, and are based on current market conditions, which will fluctuate and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. Historic market trends are not reliable indicators of actual future market behavior or future performance of any particular investment which may differ materially, and should not be relied upon as such. The investment strategies and broad themes discussed in William Blair’s social media posts may be unsuitable for investors depending on their specific investment objectives and financial situation. Information contained in posts has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but not guaranteed. You should note that the materials on the social media platforms are provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. All investments involve a degree of risk, including the risk of loss. No part of William Blair posts may be altered without express written permission from William Blair.
William Blair posts may provide links to third party websites only as a convenience and the inclusion of such links does not imply any endorsement, approval, investigation, verification or monitoring by William Blair of any content or information contained within or accessible from the linked sites. While we make every attempt to provide links only to those websites we think are trustworthy and accurate, we cannot be responsible for the content or accuracy of the information presented on those websites and we specifically disclaim any liability for any loss or damages which you may incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of them. We reserve the right to terminate a link to a third party website at any time.

Any descriptions of, references to, or links to other products, publications or services do not constitute an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship by, or affiliation with William Blair with respect to any hyper-linked site or its sponsor, unless expressly stated by William Blair.

William Blair posts on social media may include statements concerning financial market trends, and are based on current market conditions, which will fluctuate and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. Historic market trends are not reliable indicators of actual future market behavior or future performance of any particular investment which may differ materially, and should not be relied upon as such.

Information contained in posts has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but not guaranteed. You should note that the materials on the social media platforms are provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

How William Blair got so much bigger


Just months after Michelle Seitz was appointed to lead William Blair & Co. LLC's investment management division in mid-2001, she went to her firm partners with a major ask.  With financial markets still reeling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, she somewhat nervously proposed a major buildout of the division. She wanted the firm to solicit more business from large institutions; to add new products and services, especially overseas; and to have portfolio managers specialize in investment strategies as opposed to being generalists.  Yes, Blair had decent investment returns. But it needed to better advertise that to would-be investors. “The vision that I had for us was to be a respected and recognized leader in global asset management, and back then we were not,” Ms. Seitz says. “We were not a recognized force in asset management, outside of a regional footprint.”  Her bosses at the employee-owned firm backed her. Since then, she has overseen the transformation of a small Midwest money manager handling $12 billion for mainly high net-worth Chicago clients and local endowments and foundations into one managing $62 billion today, for those legacy customers plus insurance companies, corporate pensions, mutual fund companies and other institutional investors.  Other Chicago managers have expanded their assets by bigger leaps over that period, but they did it through acquisitions. Ms. Seitz has led William Blair's investment management division the hard way, by growing its own business year after year.
'BOLD MOVES'
“I can think of few other firms than have made such bold moves and succeeded,” says Charles “Chip” Roame, managing partner at industry consultants Tiburon Strategic Advisors in Tiburon, Calif.  Ms. Seitz, 48, who grew up on the Ohio River in Indiana and graduated from Indiana University with an accounting degree, joined William Blair in 1996 as a portfolio manager. She had returned to the Midwest four years earlier to take a job at a Chicago-area asset manager after a stint in Charlotte, N.C., as a money manager at the former NationsBank NA.

BIG RISK, BIG REWARD

For people and institutions with money, Chicago offers plenty of firms that will gladly manage it (for a fee, of course). The king of the hill is old standby Northern Trust. But three other firms really stand out: William Blair & Co., Oberweis Asset Management Inc. and Perritt Capital Management Inc. Here's a look at how they did it.

When she was promoted to division head, she also joined the company's executive committee, the only woman among the firm's top eight leaders. To implement her growth plan, Ms. Seitz launched new investment strategies each year, offering them on dual tracks—one for retail clients, another for institutional investors. In 2002, the firm rolled out an international institutional growth fund; in 2003, a new small to mid-cap growth fund; the following year an international equity fund, and so on with new options each year over the next decade.
quote|Michelle SeitzThe vision that I had for (William Blair & Co.) was to be a respected and recognized leader in global asset management.
She also assembled a team to trumpet William Blair's above-benchmark returns. She hired John McLaughlin in 2004 to head institutional client services and Dan Charles in 2010 to lead global business development. In addition, she brought in a chief operating officer for asset management, Rick Smirl, in 2005 and a head of private wealth business, John Brennan, in 2008. The investment management division's headcount swelled to 327 from 128 when Ms. Seitz moved up. Today, more than two-thirds of the $62 billion in assets under management come from institutional customers, including the Washington State Investment Board and mutual fund giant Vanguard Group Inc. William Blair's family of mutual funds has grown to 26, holding $10.1 billion in assets for retail customers. It also still manages $8.3 billion for high-net-worth clients. William Blair's clients still are predominantly American; just 7.4 percent of investor funds come from outside the country. But it has become more worldly by another measure: where it puts its fund. When Ms. Seitz took the post, the firm had only $500 million invested outside the U.S. Now 57 percent of the firm's assets are overseas.  Thanks to to the inflows, the division is now William Blair's biggest unit. Revenue jumped 20 percent last year to $338 million, and Ms. Seitz says she expects double-digit growth again this year.
