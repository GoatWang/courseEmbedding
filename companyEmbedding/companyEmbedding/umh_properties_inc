FREEHOLD, N.J., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- UMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE:    UMH) today announced the closing of its sale of 5,000,000 shares of its 6.75% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, liquidation preference $25.00 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), in its previously announced underwritten public offering at an offering price of $25.00 per share.  In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company has granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.   The Series C Preferred Stock is a new series of Preferred Stock which ranks on a parity with the Company's outstanding 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and 8.0% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.  The Series C Preferred Stock has been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  








The Company received net proceeds from the sale of the 5,000,000 shares, after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately $120.8 million and plans to use a portion of the net proceeds to redeem its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.  The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the purchase of manufactured homes for sale or lease to customers, expansion of its existing communities, potential acquisitions of additional properties and possible repayment of indebtedness on a short-term basis.  
The joint bookrunning managers for the offering were BMO Capital Markets Corp. and Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated. Co-managers for the offering were D.A. Davidson & Co., FBR Capital Markets & Co., a B. Riley Financial Company, and Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC.
UMH, a publicly-owned REIT, owns and operates one hundred seven manufactured home communities located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland.  In addition, the Company owns a portfolio of REIT securities.
The Series C Preferred Stock was issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus under an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. Any offer of the securities will be made only by means of a prospectus, forming part of the effective registration statement, the applicable preliminary prospectus supplement and other related documents. Copies of the prospectus and the prospectus supplement, subject to completion, relating to these securities may be obtained from BMO Capital Markets Corp. You should direct any requests to BMO Capital Markets Corp., Attention: Syndicate Department, 3 Times Square, 25th Floor, New York, New York 10036 or by telephone at (800) 414-3627 or by email at bmoprospectus@bmo.com.  You may also obtain a copy of the prospectus and the prospectus supplement, subject to completion, and other documents the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for free by visiting the Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.
Certain statements included in this press release which are not historical facts may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can provide no assurance those expectations will be achieved.  These risks include, among others, changes in the general economic climate, increased competition in the geographic areas in which the Company operates, changes in government laws and regulations and the ability of the Company to continue to identify, negotiate and acquire properties on terms favorable to the Company. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the Company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the Company or the SEC. Consequently, such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the Company's current operating plans and estimates. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. Except as otherwise required by applicable securities law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

	What our residents are saying




I am a resident at one of the UMH properties. I made a purchase of a new mobile home from UMH in March of this year. The people that I dealt with were very courteous and were able to explain what all the paperwork was for. They made my family feel comfortable and welcome.

			- The Logan Family, Heather Highlands





My name is Eileen McCouvy and I have been living in the community for 6 months. I am very pleased with my decision on moving into the neighborhood. I never have to worry about snow or ice on the roads during the winter. It’s also great because there is a hospital, shopping center, and churches nearby.

			- Eileen McCouvy, Oxford Village





My name is Ruthann Miller. I have lived here in Oxford Village for 31 years. It’s safe, people are great. We are more like one big happy family. The location is great. Hospital, shopping, grocery, etc nearby.

			- Ruthann Miller, Oxford Village





My parents enjoyed living in Southwind for 29 years and I have been a happy resident here for last 23 years. I feel safe, comfortable and secure. My neighbors are very nice and the office staff are always friendly and extremely helpful.

			- Barbara Staley, Southwind Village





I have lived here since August of 2007; I have seen multiple ownerships with our community during the time of my residency. During my tenure here there have never been any improvements to keep our community a nice place to live, until UMH Properties had purchased our community. There has been a complete turnaround and I am happy to call this place my home. It is quiet, peaceful, and I am not afraid to live alone here, the residents look out for each other. I look forward to more improvements to our community!

			- Nancy Bell, Meadowood





Thank you for keeping your promises. We are so pleased to see the progress that was a plan when we first moved here in 2004. It is not easy to make changes, let alone fast enough to meet the expectations of others. We are proud to live in the upcoming community of Lake Sherman. On a personal note, that you for painting that building. That has been needed for our eyes only. Thanks, it makes such a difference. We appreciate it and we are happy that we have neighbors that watch out for each other, which is what makes a real community.

			- Ed & Betty, Lake Sherman Village





I have lived in this community since 1991 and I enjoy living here because of the location it is at and the way it is ran. It has easy access to stores and restaurants. It’s a nice place to be with the woods right here.

			- Brenda, Mountaintop





As a new person on the block, I enjoy the view and the people here. I like riding my bike in the area. The people in the office are very nice and the neighbors are friendly- looking forward to meeting more new neighbors.

			- Joan Nahrgang, Valley View




Just a note to say how awesome the maintenance guys are here at Deer Meadows. Bob and Doug were out very late last night salting the roads and by morning, even though it was still snowing, the roads that I could see were mostly clear! Both of these men work tirelessly even during the warm days keeping this facility looking like new. The snow last night was continuous but it did not accumulate until late this afternoon (Feb 10) and at this hour (6:60 pm) they are plowing the now accumulating snow. So glad we chose to move here where real people care! Gwen is also a tireless worker managing this and other facilities! If I have something that needs attention, Gwen listens and responds! Kudos to UMH!

			- Edward Bauer, Deer Meadows

 Oxford Village 
 West Grove, PA 
 About this Community:  
	Oxford Village in West Grove Pennsylvania from UMH Properties featuring Three Bedroom Homes in Chester County , PA.
Chester County is one of the most desirable areas to live in Pennsylvania. Oxford Village manufactured home community provides a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of Philadelphia with beautiful, leafy surroundings in West Grove.
Affordable Three-Bedroom Homes in Chester County, PA
If you’d like to buy or rent a home at a great price, Oxford Village has these features:


Close to the City, But in the Suburbs. Philadelphia is only an hour away, as is Amish country in Lancaster. Delaware and Maryland are also nearby. There’s plenty to do and to see, from tax-free shopping in Delaware to a day trip to see the Liberty Bell and other historical treasures. Though Oxford Village is close to these areas, it’s located in a relaxed area.



24-Hour Maintenance and Management. Our residents enjoy the worry-free living of living in this manufactured home community. That’s because we provide affordable homes, land-leases, amenities like playgrounds, and management and maintenance staff that are always available to take your call. If you run into problems—from electrical, to plumbing, to simply needing a handy man, we can help. We’re happy to solve your problem in a timely manner.



Large, Modern Homes. These homes have three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and there’s plenty of room for everyone. Homeowners love large kitchens, master bedrooms, and master baths. Oxford Village homes have all of those and much more. In the kitchen, there is countertop and cabinet space for your appliances and cookware, plus room for an island that offers even more storage. The master bedroom includes large closets, and the master bathroom is expanded to fit both a shower and garden tub for when you’d like to unwind after a long day.

Manufactured Home or Mobile Home?
	Manufactured home communities are much different from the mobile homes that were discontinued starting in the mid-1970s. They are constructed according to stringent regional standards in a factory and then pieced together on-site. Manufactured homes are also much larger and are built to meet the many needs of today’s families.
Call us today for a tour of Oxford Village and to talk to our on-site manager.

A Brief History of UMH and Manufactured Homes
In the 1920’s “trailer coaches” began to provide American’s with a readymade place to stay while they were camping.  These trailers were used during World War II to house factory workers that were manufacturing supplies for the military. After the war, there was not an affordable option for veterans. At this time, the home was still able to be moved rather easily from location to location. In the 1960’s consumer’s wanted bigger and better mobile homes. The product began to incorporate modern appliances and amenities. Realizing the oncoming boom of the industry Eugene Landy founded United Mobile Homes, Inc. (Now known as UMH Properties, Inc.). The Mobile Home industry was bound to succeed because of its unique ability to provide affordable housing to the masses. Mobile homes were a great form of housing for young families. The Mobile Home era ended on June 15, 1976 when HUD Code was enacted. HUD Code is a federal standard that regulates the construction quality of the homes. This code is arguably stricter than many of the local building codes that stick built homes must comply with. In 1980 Congress officially adopted the term manufactured housing in an attempt to make it clear that this should be considered a building and not a vehicle.
UMH has been in business since 1968, operating as a public company since 1985.The company offers extensive experience in developing, managing and expanding manufactured housing communities. This experience provides residents with an affordable, clean and safe community lifestyle that they can be proud of. UMH is proud of our ability to reinvest in our communities and provide our residents with a top of the line manufactured housing community.
In 1985, UMH Properties, Inc. became a public company. At the time the company owned 13 communities consisting of 2675 home sites. Sam Landy was named President of UMH Properties, Inc. in 1994. In 2001, UMH owned 25 communities consisting of almost 6,000 home sites.  Also in 2001, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. commenced so that we could sellthese quality homes and provide financing to our prospective residents. Today, UMH owns and operates 107 communities consisting of 19,400 home sites. It is clear that UMH Properties, Inc. has a long history of delivering quality affordable housing and a friendly community lifestyle to our residents. We have seen the ups and downs of real estate and are able to navigate both. UMH Properties, Inc. has been around for over 49 years and our operations are stronger than ever despite the difficult economic climate and the regulations imposed on the industry. Our long history has given us the experience necessary to grow our company, continually offer the best communities and satisfy our residents. 





What is a manufactured home?
	Manufactured homes are, quite simply, homes that are built completely in a factory and then transported to a home site for placement.  Though built in a factory, these homes offer all of the amenities of a site-built home.  They come in wide variety of architectural styles, layouts, and sizes, though most are single-story homes. A single section manufactured home typically offers up to 1,000 square feet of living space, while a three section home could offer as much as 2,500.  And because they are built in a factory with the efficiency of the assembly line process, manufactured homes are often more affordable than site built homes; they are also perfect for land-lease scenarios, where the homeowner rents only the lot upon which the home is situated. 
 Check out just some of the manufactured homes that we offer. 
 
All manufactured homes are subject to the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, also known as the HUD Code, established in 1976.  These standards, many of which are more stringent than standards for site build homes, ensure that the homes meet regional standards for safety, durability, efficiency, roof load, wind resistance, and other important factors.  Before the home leaves the factory, it is carefully inspected to ensure compliance with all aspects of the HUD Code.






WHAT IS A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY?
UMH communities are known as Land-Lease communities. A Land-Lease community is a housing development where a resident owns or rents a home and leases the lot underneath the home from the landowner. The Land-Lease arrangement allows a resident to experience the true privacy and independence of a single-family home, without spending the funds otherwise spent on a land purchase. In addition, residents in a UMH community can take comfort that community standards will be carefully maintained while enjoying the many social and recreational amenities.
BENEFITS OF A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY
A Lifestyle Choice
-High quality of life, with respect for residents and their homes
-Neighborly feeling that instills a stronger sense of community and security
-Amenities offered at most of our communities, such as community clubhouses, playgrounds, swimming pools, basketball/tennis courts, fitness centers, and storage facilities for RVs and boats
-Resident events and social gatherings for all ages: Families, children, singles, and seniors.
Financial Benefits of Living in a Land-Lease Community
-Money that would have been spent on land is now free for other purposes
-Minimal closing costs, freeing up money to invest elsewhere
-Lower maintenance costs

	What our residents are saying




I am a resident at one of the UMH properties. I made a purchase of a new mobile home from UMH in March of this year. The people that I dealt with were very courteous and were able to explain what all the paperwork was for. They made my family feel comfortable and welcome.

			- The Logan Family, Heather Highlands





My name is Eileen McCouvy and I have been living in the community for 6 months. I am very pleased with my decision on moving into the neighborhood. I never have to worry about snow or ice on the roads during the winter. It’s also great because there is a hospital, shopping center, and churches nearby.

			- Eileen McCouvy, Oxford Village





My name is Ruthann Miller. I have lived here in Oxford Village for 31 years. It’s safe, people are great. We are more like one big happy family. The location is great. Hospital, shopping, grocery, etc nearby.

			- Ruthann Miller, Oxford Village





My parents enjoyed living in Southwind for 29 years and I have been a happy resident here for last 23 years. I feel safe, comfortable and secure. My neighbors are very nice and the office staff are always friendly and extremely helpful.

			- Barbara Staley, Southwind Village





I have lived here since August of 2007; I have seen multiple ownerships with our community during the time of my residency. During my tenure here there have never been any improvements to keep our community a nice place to live, until UMH Properties had purchased our community. There has been a complete turnaround and I am happy to call this place my home. It is quiet, peaceful, and I am not afraid to live alone here, the residents look out for each other. I look forward to more improvements to our community!

			- Nancy Bell, Meadowood





Thank you for keeping your promises. We are so pleased to see the progress that was a plan when we first moved here in 2004. It is not easy to make changes, let alone fast enough to meet the expectations of others. We are proud to live in the upcoming community of Lake Sherman. On a personal note, that you for painting that building. That has been needed for our eyes only. Thanks, it makes such a difference. We appreciate it and we are happy that we have neighbors that watch out for each other, which is what makes a real community.

			- Ed & Betty, Lake Sherman Village





I have lived in this community since 1991 and I enjoy living here because of the location it is at and the way it is ran. It has easy access to stores and restaurants. It’s a nice place to be with the woods right here.

			- Brenda, Mountaintop





As a new person on the block, I enjoy the view and the people here. I like riding my bike in the area. The people in the office are very nice and the neighbors are friendly- looking forward to meeting more new neighbors.

			- Joan Nahrgang, Valley View




Just a note to say how awesome the maintenance guys are here at Deer Meadows. Bob and Doug were out very late last night salting the roads and by morning, even though it was still snowing, the roads that I could see were mostly clear! Both of these men work tirelessly even during the warm days keeping this facility looking like new. The snow last night was continuous but it did not accumulate until late this afternoon (Feb 10) and at this hour (6:60 pm) they are plowing the now accumulating snow. So glad we chose to move here where real people care! Gwen is also a tireless worker managing this and other facilities! If I have something that needs attention, Gwen listens and responds! Kudos to UMH!

			- Edward Bauer, Deer Meadows

Our History



A Brief History of UMH and Manufactured Homes
In the 1920’s “trailer coaches” began to provide American’s with a readymade place to stay while they were camping.  These trailers were used during World War II to house factory workers that were manufacturing supplies for the military. After the war, there was not an affordable option for veterans. At this time, the home was still able to be moved rather easily from location to location. In the 1960’s consumer’s wanted bigger and better mobile homes. The product began to incorporate modern appliances and amenities. Realizing the oncoming boom of the industry Eugene Landy founded United Mobile Homes, Inc. (Now known as UMH Properties, Inc.). The Mobile Home industry was bound to succeed because of its unique ability to provide affordable housing to the masses. Mobile homes were a great form of housing for young families. The Mobile Home era ended on June 15, 1976 when HUD Code was enacted. HUD Code is a federal standard that regulates the construction quality of the homes. This code is arguably stricter than many of the local building codes that stick built homes must comply with. In 1980 Congress officially adopted the term manufactured housing in an attempt to make it clear that this should be considered a building and not a vehicle.
UMH has been in business since 1968, operating as a public company since 1985.The company offers extensive experience in developing, managing and expanding manufactured housing communities. This experience provides residents with an affordable, clean and safe community lifestyle that they can be proud of. UMH is proud of our ability to reinvest in our communities and provide our residents with a top of the line manufactured housing community.
In 1985, UMH Properties, Inc. became a public company. At the time the company owned 13 communities consisting of 2675 home sites. Sam Landy was named President of UMH Properties, Inc. in 1994. In 2001, UMH owned 25 communities consisting of almost 6,000 home sites.  Also in 2001, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. commenced so that we could sellthese quality homes and provide financing to our prospective residents. Today, UMH owns and operates 107 communities consisting of 19,400 home sites. It is clear that UMH Properties, Inc. has a long history of delivering quality affordable housing and a friendly community lifestyle to our residents. We have seen the ups and downs of real estate and are able to navigate both. UMH Properties, Inc. has been around for over 49 years and our operations are stronger than ever despite the difficult economic climate and the regulations imposed on the industry. Our long history has given us the experience necessary to grow our company, continually offer the best communities and satisfy our residents. 


Manufactured Homes


What is a manufactured home?
	Manufactured homes are, quite simply, homes that are built completely in a factory and then transported to a home site for placement.  Though built in a factory, these homes offer all of the amenities of a site-built home.  They come in wide variety of architectural styles, layouts, and sizes, though most are single-story homes. A single section manufactured home typically offers up to 1,000 square feet of living space, while a three section home could offer as much as 2,500.  And because they are built in a factory with the efficiency of the assembly line process, manufactured homes are often more affordable than site built homes; they are also perfect for land-lease scenarios, where the homeowner rents only the lot upon which the home is situated. 
 Check out just some of the manufactured homes that we offer. 
 
All manufactured homes are subject to the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, also known as the HUD Code, established in 1976.  These standards, many of which are more stringent than standards for site build homes, ensure that the homes meet regional standards for safety, durability, efficiency, roof load, wind resistance, and other important factors.  Before the home leaves the factory, it is carefully inspected to ensure compliance with all aspects of the HUD Code.


Land-Lease Communities



WHAT IS A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY?
UMH communities are known as Land-Lease communities. A Land-Lease community is a housing development where a resident owns or rents a home and leases the lot underneath the home from the landowner. The Land-Lease arrangement allows a resident to experience the true privacy and independence of a single-family home, without spending the funds otherwise spent on a land purchase. In addition, residents in a UMH community can take comfort that community standards will be carefully maintained while enjoying the many social and recreational amenities.
BENEFITS OF A LAND-LEASE COMMUNITY
A Lifestyle Choice
-High quality of life, with respect for residents and their homes
-Neighborly feeling that instills a stronger sense of community and security
-Amenities offered at most of our communities, such as community clubhouses, playgrounds, swimming pools, basketball/tennis courts, fitness centers, and storage facilities for RVs and boats
-Resident events and social gatherings for all ages: Families, children, singles, and seniors.
Financial Benefits of Living in a Land-Lease Community
-Money that would have been spent on land is now free for other purposes
-Minimal closing costs, freeing up money to invest elsewhere
-Lower maintenance costs

	What our residents are saying




I am a resident at one of the UMH properties. I made a purchase of a new mobile home from UMH in March of this year. The people that I dealt with were very courteous and were able to explain what all the paperwork was for. They made my family feel comfortable and welcome.

			- The Logan Family, Heather Highlands





My name is Eileen McCouvy and I have been living in the community for 6 months. I am very pleased with my decision on moving into the neighborhood. I never have to worry about snow or ice on the roads during the winter. It’s also great because there is a hospital, shopping center, and churches nearby.

			- Eileen McCouvy, Oxford Village





My name is Ruthann Miller. I have lived here in Oxford Village for 31 years. It’s safe, people are great. We are more like one big happy family. The location is great. Hospital, shopping, grocery, etc nearby.

			- Ruthann Miller, Oxford Village





My parents enjoyed living in Southwind for 29 years and I have been a happy resident here for last 23 years. I feel safe, comfortable and secure. My neighbors are very nice and the office staff are always friendly and extremely helpful.

			- Barbara Staley, Southwind Village





I have lived here since August of 2007; I have seen multiple ownerships with our community during the time of my residency. During my tenure here there have never been any improvements to keep our community a nice place to live, until UMH Properties had purchased our community. There has been a complete turnaround and I am happy to call this place my home. It is quiet, peaceful, and I am not afraid to live alone here, the residents look out for each other. I look forward to more improvements to our community!

			- Nancy Bell, Meadowood





Thank you for keeping your promises. We are so pleased to see the progress that was a plan when we first moved here in 2004. It is not easy to make changes, let alone fast enough to meet the expectations of others. We are proud to live in the upcoming community of Lake Sherman. On a personal note, that you for painting that building. That has been needed for our eyes only. Thanks, it makes such a difference. We appreciate it and we are happy that we have neighbors that watch out for each other, which is what makes a real community.

			- Ed & Betty, Lake Sherman Village





I have lived in this community since 1991 and I enjoy living here because of the location it is at and the way it is ran. It has easy access to stores and restaurants. It’s a nice place to be with the woods right here.

			- Brenda, Mountaintop





As a new person on the block, I enjoy the view and the people here. I like riding my bike in the area. The people in the office are very nice and the neighbors are friendly- looking forward to meeting more new neighbors.

			- Joan Nahrgang, Valley View




Just a note to say how awesome the maintenance guys are here at Deer Meadows. Bob and Doug were out very late last night salting the roads and by morning, even though it was still snowing, the roads that I could see were mostly clear! Both of these men work tirelessly even during the warm days keeping this facility looking like new. The snow last night was continuous but it did not accumulate until late this afternoon (Feb 10) and at this hour (6:60 pm) they are plowing the now accumulating snow. So glad we chose to move here where real people care! Gwen is also a tireless worker managing this and other facilities! If I have something that needs attention, Gwen listens and responds! Kudos to UMH!

			- Edward Bauer, Deer Meadows
