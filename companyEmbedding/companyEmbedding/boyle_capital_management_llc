Please read this important information. This Site is not directed toward any person in any jurisdiction where (by reason of that person's nationality, residence or otherwise) the publication or availability of the Site is prohibited. Persons in respect of whom such prohibitions apply must not access the Site.
Privacy NoticeAt Boyle Capital, we respect your personal financial privacy. We realize that you have entrusted us with private personal financial information, and it is important to us that you know our policy concerning what we do with that information.
				We collect personal financial information about you from the following sources:
			

Information you provide us in investment advisory agreements, brokerage account applications, and other documents you complete in connection with the opening and maintenance of your accounts with us; and
Information you provide us orally; and
Information we receive from third parties, such as brokerage firms, about your transactions with us or with others.
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal financial information about you to anyone, except in the following circumstances:
When required to execute transactions for your account or otherwise to provide services you have requested; or
When you have specifically authorized us to do so in writing; or When permitted or required by law.

Within our firm, we restrict access to your personal financial information to the employees who need to know that information to provide services to you. To ensure security and confidentiality, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your privacy.
Products and ServicesNothing contained in the Site is intended as, or constitutes, an offer to buy or sell or is in any way a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities, investments or other property. Any decision to invest should not be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this Site.
				Please remember that the value of your investments and any income they produce may go down as well as up, and you may lose principal value. As part of the discretionary management arrangement in which separate account clients engage Boyle Capital, investments in Boyle Capital Strategies will have varying amounts of exposure to securities and cash or cash equivalent holdings. These investment and portfolio management decisions are at the sole discretion of Boyle Capital. Therefore, depending on individual investments and overall market conditions, Boyle Capital’s Investment Strategies may not track movements in the overall stock and bond markets, particularly over the short term.  As a result, there may be times that client investment objectives will not be achieved. 
				While the intent of Boyle Capital’s Investment Strategies may include one or more objectives, including, without limitation, long-term capital appreciation, total return, current income, or conservation of capital, the investment return and principal value of each Strategy may fluctuate or deviate from overall market returns to a greater degree than other investment products and services that do not employ these Strategies. For example, if an Investment Strategy has taken a defensive posture and the market advances, the return to investors will be lower than if the portfolio had not been defensive. Alternatively, if an Investment Strategy has taken an aggressive posture, a market decline will magnify the Strategy's investment losses.
				Boyle Capital reserves the right to modify its current investment strategies and investment techniques based on changing market dynamics or client needs.
				Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future results. Many factors and risks, including, without limitation, investment risk, market risk, interest rate risk, management style risk, business and sector risk, small company risk, non-diversified strategy risk, foreign securities risk, bond interest rate risk, and credit risk may affect the value of your investments. Furthermore, levels and bases of taxation are subject to change and will depend on your personal circumstances. Moreover, specific risks may arise in relation to specific investments and you should review the risk factors very carefully before investing. 
				Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors on the tax implications of making an investment in securities, holding or disposing of securities, investments in other property, or distributions of income in these respective holdings.
			
Market and Performance InformationAny market, price or performance data provided on this Site is for informational purposes only. Boyle Capital believes that the information which may be viewed on this Site is accurate as of the date of publication, and where a particular page is dated the information on such page is believed to be accurate as of that date. However, although the information sources are deemed to be reliable, Boyle Capital does not guarantee or make any warranty regarding the accuracy, suitability or completeness of such information, or any information available through any site to which you may link through this Site.
GIPS® Verification and Performance ExaminationBoyle Capital claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). The U.S. dollar is the currency used to express the returns presented in the GIPS® verification. The year-by-year performance returns cover the period June 2008, through September 30, 2014, on a firm-wide basis. 
				The GIPS® verification was prepared by Boyle Capital and presented to and examined by the independent firm Dabney Consulting, LLC. Dabney Consulting continues to verify that each quarter Boyle Capital is in compliance with the GIPS® standards on a firm-wide basis. Typically, quarterly verifications run one to two quarters in arrears of the most recent performance information presented. 
				Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS®standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS® standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
				The verification report and a complete list of all Boyle Capital composites are available upon request.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

As part of the discretionary management arrangement in which separate account clients engage Boyle Capital, investments in Boyle Capital Strategies will have varying amounts of exposure to securities and cash or cash equivalent holdings. These investment and portfolio management decisions are at the sole discretion of Boyle Capital. Therefore, depending on individual investments and overall market conditions, Boyle Capital’s Investment Strategies may not track movements in the overall stock and bond markets, particularly over the short term.  As a result, there may be times that client investment objectives will not be achieved. 
				While the intent of Boyle Capital’s Investment Strategies may include one or more objectives, including, without limitation, long-term capital appreciation, total return, current income, or conservation of capital, the investment return and principal value of each Strategy may fluctuate or deviate from overall market returns to a greater degree than other investment products and services that do not employ these Strategies. For example, if an Investment Strategy has taken a defensive posture and the market advances, the return to investors will be lower than if the portfolio had not been defensive. Alternatively, if an Investment Strategy has taken an aggressive posture, a market decline will magnify the Strategy's investment losses.
				Boyle Capital reserves the right to modify its current investment strategies and investment techniques based on changing market dynamics or client needs.
				Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future results. Many factors and risks, including, without limitation, investment risk, market risk, interest rate risk, management style risk, business and sector risk, small company risk, non-diversified strategy risk, foreign securities risk, bond interest rate risk, and credit risk may affect the value of your investments. Furthermore, levels and bases of taxation are subject to change and will depend on your personal circumstances. Moreover, specific risks may arise in relation to specific investments and you should review the risk factors very carefully before investing. 
				Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors on the tax implications of making an investment in securities, holding or disposing of securities, investments in other property, or distributions of income in these respective holdings.
			
Market and Performance InformationAny market, price or performance data provided on this Site is for informational purposes only. Boyle Capital believes that the information which may be viewed on this Site is accurate as of the date of publication, and where a particular page is dated the information on such page is believed to be accurate as of that date. However, although the information sources are deemed to be reliable, Boyle Capital does not guarantee or make any warranty regarding the accuracy, suitability or completeness of such information, or any information available through any site to which you may link through this Site.
GIPS® Verification and Performance ExaminationBoyle Capital claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). The U.S. dollar is the currency used to express the returns presented in the GIPS® verification. The year-by-year performance returns cover the period June 2008, through September 30, 2014, on a firm-wide basis. 
				The GIPS® verification was prepared by Boyle Capital and presented to and examined by the independent firm Dabney Consulting, LLC. Dabney Consulting continues to verify that each quarter Boyle Capital is in compliance with the GIPS® standards on a firm-wide basis. Typically, quarterly verifications run one to two quarters in arrears of the most recent performance information presented. 
				Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS®standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS® standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
				The verification report and a complete list of all Boyle Capital composites are available upon request.

Approach

Investment Process
Source of Ideas
Process for Evaluating an Investment
Process of Getting Invested
Risk Management





Boyle Capital takes a fundamental, research-intensive value approach to investing. The research process is based on a bottoms up analysis (i.e. Company specific), although Boyle Capital does include top-down factors in its overall analysis (e.g., how will a company be impacted by a downturn in the economy, a rise or fall in interest rates, etc.).
Boyle Capital generally seeks to make investments in three broad categories of opportunities:


1.
Great businesses at fair prices.


2.
Good businesses or assets at extraordinarily cheap prices often with a catalyst to realize value.


3.
Mispriced probabilistic investments where the market price of a security under- or over-estimates the probability of a favorable outcome of a legal decision, contract or patent award, or such other event that is expected to lead to a significant change in the valuation of a security.




The majority of our investment ideas are internally generated through independent research. News services can be a source of new ideas, as well as quantitative screen searches on various databases. Trade shows and conferences may also yield new ideas. Often the best ideas will come from a bottom-up review of a company, its history and its industry, and a reinterpretation of facts and events that other investors have not previously done. New investments may also be identified from existing investments in the portfolio, as we leverage lessons learned in earlier research to uncover additional opportunities.


Once a potential investment appears sufficiently promising, we delve deeply into the historical record of the potential investment and look for sources of comparable data on both public and private companies. This process involves the analysis of corporate reports, press releases, and financial statements, and reviewing documents filed with the SEC or other regulatory entities, court filings, newspaper, magazine, and internet articles, audio or transcripts of conference calls, presentations, and a variety of additional sources. We may also seek to meet with management to attempt to better understand the long-term strengths and weaknesses of the industry or the conditions under which the company operates.


Our accounts are separately managed and our focus is on absolute returns. As such, we invest each account individually and do not manage on a “model.” Managing accounts on a model means that every account is fully invested on the first day and holds the same stocks. Boyle Capital does not manage accounts in this way because we feel that it is imperative to not just make the right investment, but it is equally important to make it at the right price. Therefore, we invest accounts one position at a time, and we will only purchase when a company is trading at or below our target buy price. When a company drops into our buy range, it is added to each portfolio. Due to this strict purchase criteria, each account under Boyle Capital’s management may not hold all of the same securities or the same weighting in each security, depending on the inception date of each account. While this process creates a higher dispersion between accounts, we think it makes the most investment sense, ultimately resulting in better performance.


At Boyle Capital, we do not believe in formulaic approaches to risk management. Our primary risk management tool is the extensive research we complete prior to making an initial investment. We define investment risk as the probability of a permanent loss of capital rather than security price volatility. The factors that we take into account include: (i) volatility/predictability of the businesses (low), (ii) correlation with macroeconomic factors, (iii) financial leverage (minimal), (iv) defensible market positions, and (v) discount to intrinsic value (large). It is our belief that the acquisition of a portfolio of investments, each of which has been acquired at a large discount to intrinsic value, will provide a margin of safety that can mitigate the likelihood of an overall permanent loss of capital.

Please read this important information. This Site is not directed toward any person in any jurisdiction where (by reason of that person's nationality, residence or otherwise) the publication or availability of the Site is prohibited. Persons in respect of whom such prohibitions apply must not access the Site.
Privacy NoticeAt Boyle Capital, we respect your personal financial privacy. We realize that you have entrusted us with private personal financial information, and it is important to us that you know our policy concerning what we do with that information.
				We collect personal financial information about you from the following sources:
			

Information you provide us in investment advisory agreements, brokerage account applications, and other documents you complete in connection with the opening and maintenance of your accounts with us; and
Information you provide us orally; and
Information we receive from third parties, such as brokerage firms, about your transactions with us or with others.
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal financial information about you to anyone, except in the following circumstances:
When required to execute transactions for your account or otherwise to provide services you have requested; or
When you have specifically authorized us to do so in writing; or When permitted or required by law.

Within our firm, we restrict access to your personal financial information to the employees who need to know that information to provide services to you. To ensure security and confidentiality, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your privacy.
Products and ServicesNothing contained in the Site is intended as, or constitutes, an offer to buy or sell or is in any way a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities, investments or other property. Any decision to invest should not be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this Site.
				Please remember that the value of your investments and any income they produce may go down as well as up, and you may lose principal value. As part of the discretionary management arrangement in which separate account clients engage Boyle Capital, investments in Boyle Capital Strategies will have varying amounts of exposure to securities and cash or cash equivalent holdings. These investment and portfolio management decisions are at the sole discretion of Boyle Capital. Therefore, depending on individual investments and overall market conditions, Boyle Capital’s Investment Strategies may not track movements in the overall stock and bond markets, particularly over the short term.  As a result, there may be times that client investment objectives will not be achieved. 
				While the intent of Boyle Capital’s Investment Strategies may include one or more objectives, including, without limitation, long-term capital appreciation, total return, current income, or conservation of capital, the investment return and principal value of each Strategy may fluctuate or deviate from overall market returns to a greater degree than other investment products and services that do not employ these Strategies. For example, if an Investment Strategy has taken a defensive posture and the market advances, the return to investors will be lower than if the portfolio had not been defensive. Alternatively, if an Investment Strategy has taken an aggressive posture, a market decline will magnify the Strategy's investment losses.
				Boyle Capital reserves the right to modify its current investment strategies and investment techniques based on changing market dynamics or client needs.
				Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future results. Many factors and risks, including, without limitation, investment risk, market risk, interest rate risk, management style risk, business and sector risk, small company risk, non-diversified strategy risk, foreign securities risk, bond interest rate risk, and credit risk may affect the value of your investments. Furthermore, levels and bases of taxation are subject to change and will depend on your personal circumstances. Moreover, specific risks may arise in relation to specific investments and you should review the risk factors very carefully before investing. 
				Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors on the tax implications of making an investment in securities, holding or disposing of securities, investments in other property, or distributions of income in these respective holdings.
			
Market and Performance InformationAny market, price or performance data provided on this Site is for informational purposes only. Boyle Capital believes that the information which may be viewed on this Site is accurate as of the date of publication, and where a particular page is dated the information on such page is believed to be accurate as of that date. However, although the information sources are deemed to be reliable, Boyle Capital does not guarantee or make any warranty regarding the accuracy, suitability or completeness of such information, or any information available through any site to which you may link through this Site.
GIPS® Verification and Performance ExaminationBoyle Capital claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). The U.S. dollar is the currency used to express the returns presented in the GIPS® verification. The year-by-year performance returns cover the period June 2008, through September 30, 2014, on a firm-wide basis. 
				The GIPS® verification was prepared by Boyle Capital and presented to and examined by the independent firm Dabney Consulting, LLC. Dabney Consulting continues to verify that each quarter Boyle Capital is in compliance with the GIPS® standards on a firm-wide basis. Typically, quarterly verifications run one to two quarters in arrears of the most recent performance information presented. 
				Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS®standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS® standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
				The verification report and a complete list of all Boyle Capital composites are available upon request.
