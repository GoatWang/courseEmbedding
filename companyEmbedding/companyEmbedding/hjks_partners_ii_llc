Venture Funds I & II























KB Partners, LLC is a suburban Chicago based investment firm established in 1996 to make investments in a variety of angel funded and venture capital opportunities.
KB's objective is to build dominant new enterprises by working in partnership with talented entrepreneurs and experienced managers. 






 
































PatchPump® is the most size efficient and scalable delivery product for injectable drugs because:
One single ECell design acts as both the power source and the driving mechanism for the whole range of drug volumes and viscosities; The volume of the drug container is easily changed without fundamental changes to the technology. 

















 
[ Current Angel Investment ] 
























KB Partners got its start in 1996 by making a series of angel investments in order to establish a track record and name for itself. It has since raised two early stage technology oriented traditional venture capital funds, KB Partners Venture Fund I and KB Partners Venture Fund II, from a group of high net worth individuals and institutional investors. Both funds have been fully invested and company Founder Keith Bank is now investing personal capital in individual deals in combination with a variety of co-investors, in lieu of raising any additional institutional venture funds. KB is also actively involved in Versatile Sports Partners, a Chicago based firm created to pursue select investment opportunities in the sports and golf industries, along with select real estate situations.
At our core, we are entrepreneurs with a passion for building great companies. We've been in the operating trenches before and recognize that building and growing early stage companies is as much art as science. No business plan or financial forecast can prepare an entrepreneur for the myriad of situations that will be faced when starting and building a company. However, experience can be the difference between exponential growth and severe growing pains.
KB Partners has a proven track record of helping young companies transform themselves into market leaders. We have faced many of the issues confronted regularly by the entrepreneurs we back. Accordingly, our ability to apply our own operating experiences to these challenges enables us to provide hands-on assistance with all aspects of an organization.
