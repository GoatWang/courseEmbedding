Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Radiopaque Coatings    
    Source: Implant Sciences Corporation






	Radiopaque coatings developed by Implant Sciences Corp. are applied to intravenous devices as markers

Contact The Supplier


Radiopaque coatings developed by Implant Sciences Corp. are applied to intravenous devices as markers. The coatings absorb x-rays, making the treated bands on catheters, stents, and other devices easily visible using fluoroscopy. 




The biocompatible coatings are microfused by a proprietary vacuum process. The result is a thin, but extremely dense coating that provides high contrast and sharp edges when viewed on film or a fluoroscopic.




Radiopaque coatings can be applied in any chosen pattern and can achieve 100% attenuation of a fluoroscopic spectrum. Coatings of up to 15 microns thick can be deposited on polymeric as well as metallic surfaces, and they never peel or delaminate.
