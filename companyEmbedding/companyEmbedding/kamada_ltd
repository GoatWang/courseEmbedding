	Kamada Announces Withdrawal of European Marketing Authorization Application for Inhaled Alpha-1-Antitrypsin


	for Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disease


	 


	US Phase 3 Pivotal Study Planned to Commence in 2018; Company Intends to Utilize Supplementary Data to be


	Obtained from that Study to Resubmit MAA to EMA


	 


	Rehovot, Israel

	,

	June 22, 2017 – Kamada Ltd. (NASDAQ & TASE: KMDA), a plasma-derived protein therapeutics company focused on orphan indications, today announced that the Company has withdrawn the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for

	its proprietary inhaled Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) therapy for the treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)

	with the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  Following extensive discussions with the EMA during recent months, Kamada concluded that the EMA does not view the data submitted to date as sufficient for approval of the MAA, and that the supplementary data needed for approval requires an additional clinical trial.


	 


	While the post-hoc data provided by the Company from the European clinical trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function, the EMA was of the opinion that an overall positive conclusion on the effect of inhaled AAT to treat AATD could not be reached based on that post-hoc analysis, and that the treatment of AATD patients with inhaled AAT should be further evaluated in the clinic in order to obtain comprehensive long-term efficacy and safety data.


	 


	Kamada is currently in advanced discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to secure the approval of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application this year to conduct a U.S. Phase 3 pivotal study of inhaled AAT for the treatment of AATD that would begin in 2018.  Kamada intends to utilize the data to be obtained from that pivotal study to resubmit the MAA to the EMA.  Kamada will continue discussions with the EMA regarding the required data that would support the approval of the Company’s MAA.  Based on the substantial data set obtained to date, the extensive discussions with the EMA and FDA, as well as key opinion leaders in AATD, Kamada has a strong understanding of the indication, the method of treatment with an inhaled product and the key regulatory guidelines.


	 


	“While we are disappointed that the withdrawal of our MAA extends the timeline for the potential approval of inhaled AAT for AATD in Europe, we remain committed to the continued development of this product,” said Amir London, Chief Executive Officer.  “Based on the successful U.S. Phase 2 study concluded late last year and the positive lung function data from the European Phase 2/3 studies, we believe that inhaled AAT has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for AATD, an area with significant unmet medical need.  We appreciate the strong support we continue to receive from patients and clinicians, as well as the transparent discussions with the EMA, and look forward to moving ahead with a U.S. Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial, once approved, as expeditiously as possible, which would allow us to

	utilize the supplementary data

	to be obtained from that study in order to resubmit our MAA to the EMA at an appropriate time thereafter.”


	 


	“Importantly, Kamada is the first and only company to date that has developed and completed a pivotal clinical program of an inhaled formulation of AAT for the treatment of this life-threatening orphan disease,” continued Mr. London.  “We are confident that the significant clinical and regulatory experience we have gained during recent years in the development of our inhaled AAT positions us well to design and execute a successful clinical trial and bring this promising product to the market in both the US and EU.”


	 








	 


	About Kamada


	 


	Kamada Ltd. is focused on plasma-derived protein therapeutics for orphan indications, and has a commercial product portfolio and a robust late-stage product pipeline. The Company uses its proprietary platform technology and know-how for the extraction and purification of proteins from human plasma to produce Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) in a highly-purified, liquid form, as well as other plasma-derived Immune globulins. AAT is a protein derived from human plasma with known and newly-discovered therapeutic roles given its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective and antimicrobial properties. The Company’s flagship product is Glassia®, the first and only liquid, ready-to-use, intravenous plasma-derived AAT product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Kamada markets Glassia® in the U.S. through a strategic partnership with Baxalta (formerly Baxter International Inc.’s BioScience business and now part of Shire plc) and in other counties through local distributors.  In addition to Glassia®, Kamada has a product line of seven other pharmaceutical products administered by injection or infusion, that are marketed through distributors in more than 15 countries, including Israel, Russia, Brazil, India and other countries in Latin America and Asia. Kamada has five late-stage plasma-derived protein products in development, including an inhaled formulation of AAT for the treatment of AAT deficiency that completed a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trials in Europe and a Phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S. for the treatment of AAT deficiency using our proprietary inhaled AAT. In addition, Kamada's intravenous AAT is in development for other indications such as type-1 diabetes, GvHD and prevention of lung transplant rejection. Kamada also leverages its expertise and presence in the plasma-derived protein therapeutics market by distributing more than 10 pharmaceutical products in Israel that are manufactured by third parties.

Kamada Ltd. Key Developments

Kamada Ltd. Submits Proposed Phase 3 Protocol to FDA for Inhaled Alpha-1-Antitrypsin for Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disease
Jul 20 17
Kamada Ltd. announced that the company has submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review a proposed pivotal Phase 3 protocol for its proprietary inhaled Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) therapy (Inhaled AAT) for the treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). The proposed Phase 3 pivotal study is intended to treat AATD subjects with inhaled AAT at a dose of 80 mg once daily for a period of two years, with a placebo arm at a 2:1 ratio with cross over to the treatment arm following a period of 12 months. In parallel, a concurrent Intravenous AAT (AAT IV) arm will be evaluated for two years. The study is planned to include approximately 200-300 patients, and is expected to measure lung function as a primary endpoint and lung density as a secondary endpoint. As previously announced, the company has completed a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in Europe and a Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States (U.S.) with its Inhaled AAT for the treatment of AATD. The U.S. Phase 2 study, which was double-blind and placebo-controlled, met its primary endpoint and the results indicated that patients treated with it's Inhaled AAT, in both dosage arms (80 mg/day and 160 mg/day), demonstrated a significant increase of antigenic AAT, and of Anti-Neutrophil Elastase inhibitory Capacity (ANEC) in the endothelial lining fluid (ELF) levels in the lungs compared to the placebo group. When the company presented the data from the European Phase 2/3 study to the FDA, the agency expressed concerns and questions about that data, primarily related to the safety and efficacy of Inhaled AAT for the treatment of AATD and the risk/benefit balance to patients based on that data. Those questions and concerns will need to be resolved before the FDA will allow the company to proceed with additional clinical development of Inhaled AAT in the U.S., including the planned Phase 3 pivotal study. In order to address the FDA comments, in April 2017, the Company submitted to the agency the results of the U.S. Phase 2 data together with a proposed Phase 3 synopsis. The FDA has provided the company with guidance for further development of the synopsis and requested that the company submit a complete proposed study protocol for the next phase prior to enabling the company to continue clinical development in the U.S.


Kamada Ltd Announces Withdrawal of European Marketing Authorization Application for Inhaled Alpha-1 Antitrypsin for Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Disease
Jun 22 17
Kamada Ltd. announced that the company has withdrawn the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for its proprietary inhaled Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) therapy for the treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Following extensive discussions with the EMA during recent months, Kamada concluded that the EMA does not view the data submitted to date as sufficient for approval of the MAA, and that the supplementary data needed for approval requires an additional clinical trial. While the post-hoc data provided by the Company from the European clinical trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function, the EMA was of the opinion that an overall positive conclusion on the effect of inhaled AAT to treat AATD could not be reached based on that post-hoc analysis, and that the treatment of AATD patients with inhaled AAT should be further evaluated in the clinic in order to obtain comprehensive long-term efficacy and safety data. Kamada is currently in advanced discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to secure the approval of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application this year to conduct a U.S. Phase 3 pivotal study of inhaled AAT for the treatment of AATD that would begin in 2018. Kamada intends to utilize the data to be obtained from that pivotal study to resubmit the MAA to the EMA. Kamada will continue discussions with the EMA regarding the required data that would support the approval of the Company’s MAA. Based on the substantial data set obtained to date, the extensive discussions with the EMA and FDA, as well as key opinion leaders in AATD, Kamada has a strong understanding of the indication, the method of treatment with an inhaled product and the key regulatory guidelines.


Kamada Announces Distribution Agreement with Shire for IV Alpha-1 Antitrypsin
Jun 12 17
Kamada Ltd. has announced the receipt of an undisclosed additional milestone payment under the supply and distribution agreement with Shire plc for GLASSIA, Kamada's intravenous (IV) alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). The milestone payment was triggered by Shire achieving a sales milestone for GLASSIA in the US. Shire is Kamada's strategic partner for the exclusive supply and distribution of GLASSIA for all intravenous (IV) indications in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The most recent contract extension, signed in October 2016, represented the fourth time the companies have extended the contract for the manufacturing and supply of GLASSIA. Under the current agreement, Kamada's minimum revenue for GLASSIA for the years 2017 to 2020 will reach approximately $237 million, and may be expanded to up to $288 million during that period.

RABIES IMMUNOGLOBULIN


RABIES IMMUNOGLOBULIN
WHO estimates that approximately 10 million people worldwide require medical treatment against rabies each year after being exposed to an animal suspected of rabies infection. In the U.S. alone there are approximately 40,000 post-exposure prophylaxis treatments administrated each year, representing a more than $100 million annual market opportunity.
KamRAB is the brand name for Kamada's human rabies immune globulin currently marketed for this indication in 10 countries worldwide.
Kamada has a strategic agreement with Kedrion S.p.A for the clinical development and marketing of its IgG product, which will be branded as KedRAB in the U.S., subject to receiving marketing approval from the FDA.
The Phase 2/3 clinical trial was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study of 118 healthy subjects.  The study evaluated pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of anti-rabies IgG levels in serum at different time points and assessed whether Kamada’s IgG interferes with the development of self-active antibodies. In addition, safety and tolerability were assessed.  The trial’s primary end point measured the anti-rabies titer on day 14 as well as on additional time points for secondary end points, following drug infusion and infusion of an active vaccine as recommended by the standard-of-care.
top-line results showed that the primary endpoint of non-inferiority was met with a difference of -1.8% between the two therapies with variability between -8.2% and 3.1% (90% Confidence limit).  Results showed that Kamada’s IgG was safe and well tolerated with no drug-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) experienced.
 Kamada expects that an approved product in the U.S. will provide diversity of supply in a market with ample room for a new product entry while improving Kamada profitability with higher margins expected in the US compared to rest of the world countries. Kamada plans to leverage the U.S. trial and potential future marketing approval to expand global market leadership with this critical medical treatment.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

DIABETES TYPE 1


DIABETES TYPE 1
There is clinical evidence that AAT slows or perhaps even stops the pancreatic inflammatory beta cells. Recent research indicates highly favorable results in animal models treated with AAT.
Kamada reported positive results for efficacy and safety in a unique of its kind, phase 1/2  clinical study in pediatric and young adult patients suffering from Type-1 Diabetes (T1D). The patients were treated with Kamada’s Glassia product that contains the AAT protein and that was fully developed by Kamada.
Analysis of the study data shows that AAT may slow down the rate of disease progression by allowing continued functionality of insulin-secreting beta cells and better glycemic control. This effect may potentially reduce future severe disease complications.
Kamada is currentrly conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of Glassia® to treat newly diagnosed pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Glassia to halt disease progression and maintain the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin.  By maintaining its ability to produce insulin, the body can independently control glucose level and avoid diabetes complications that result from poor glycemic control (e.g., cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, eye and vision problems, neurological damage and more).
