FERGUSON, Mo. —  Garland Moore, a hospital worker, lived in this St. Louis suburb for much of his 33 years, a period in which a largely white community has become a largely black one.He attended its schools and is raising his family in this place of suburban homes and apartment buildings on the outskirts of a struggling Midwest city. And over time, he has felt his life to be circumscribed by Ferguson’s demographics.Mr. Moore, who is black, talks of how he has felt the wrath of the police here and in surrounding suburbs for years — roughed up during a minor traffic stop and prevented from entering a park when he was wearing St. Louis Cardinals red.

And last week, as he stood at a vigil for an unarmed 18-year-old shot dead by the police — a shooting that provoked renewed street violence and looting early Saturday — Mr. Moore heard anger welling and listened to a shout of: “We’re tired of the racist police department.” Continue reading the main story

“It broke the camel’s back,” Mr. Moore said of the killing of the teenager, Michael Brown. Referring to the northern part of St. Louis County, he continued, “The people in North County — not just African-Americans, some of the white people, too — they are tired of the police harassment.”

The origins of the area’s complex social and racial history date to the 19th century when the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County went their separate ways, leading to the formation of dozens of smaller communities outside St. Louis. Missouri itself has always been a state with roots in both the Midwest and the South, and racial issues intensified in the 20th century as St. Louis became a stopping point for the northern migration of Southern blacks seeking factory jobs in Detroit and Chicago.As African-Americans moved into the city and whites moved out, real estate agents and city leaders, in a pattern familiar elsewhere in the country, conspired to keep blacks out of the suburbs through the use of zoning ordinances and restrictive covenants. But by the 1970s, some of those barriers had started to fall, and whites moved even farther away from the city. These days, Ferguson is like many of the suburbs around St. Louis, inner-ring towns that accommodated white flight decades ago but that are now largely black. And yet they retain a white power structure.Although about two-thirds of Ferguson residents are black, its mayor and five of its six City Council members are white. Only three of the town’s 53 police officers are black.Turnout for local elections in Ferguson has been poor. The mayor, James W. Knowles III, noted his disappointment with the turnout — about 12 percent — in the most recent mayoral election during a City Council meeting in April. Patricia Bynes, a black woman who is the Democratic committeewoman for the Ferguson area, said the lack of black involvement in local government was partly the result of the black population’s being more transient in small municipalities and less attached to them.There is also some frustration among blacks who say town government is not attuned to their concerns.Aliyah Woods, 45, once petitioned Ferguson officials for a sign that would warn drivers that a deaf family lived on that block. But the sign never came. “You get tired,” she said. “You keep asking, you keep asking. Nothing gets done.”

A Protest Ignited


Protesters angered over the police shooting of Michael Brown, 18, squared off with law enforcement in the streets of Ferguson, Mo., again, looting some stores.

Mr. Moore, who recently moved to neighboring Florissant, said he had attended a couple of Ferguson Council meetings to complain that the police should be patrolling the residential streets to try to prevent break-ins rather than lying in wait to catch people for traffic violations.

This year, community members voiced anger after the all-white, seven-member school board for the Ferguson-Florissant district pushed aside its black superintendent for unrevealed reasons. That spurred several blacks to run for three board positions up for election, but only one won a seat.The St. Louis County Police Department fired a white lieutenant last year for ordering officers to target blacks in shopping areas. That resulted in the department’s enlisting researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, to study whether the department was engaging in racial profiling.And in recent years, two school districts in North County lost their accreditation. One, Normandy, where Mr. Brown graduated this year, serves parts of Ferguson. When parents in the mostly black district sought to allow their children to transfer to schools in mostly white districts, they said, they felt a backlash with racial undertones. Frustration with underfunded and underperforming schools has long been a problem, and when Gov. Jay Nixon held a news conference on Friday to discuss safety and security in Ferguson, he was confronted with angry residents demanding to know what he would do to fix their schools.Ferguson’s economic shortcomings reflect the struggles of much of the region. Its median household income of about $37,000 is less than the statewide number, and its poverty level of 22 percent outpaces the state’s by seven percentage points.In Ferguson, residents say most racial tensions have to do with an overzealous police force.“It is the people in a position of authority in our community that have to come forward,” said Jerome Jenkins, 47, who, with his wife, Cathy, owns Cathy’s Kitchen, a downtown Ferguson restaurant.

“What you are witnessing is our little small government has to conform to the change that we are trying to do,” Mr. Jenkins added. “Sometimes things happen for a purpose; maybe we can get it right.”Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, has been working with the Justice Department’s community relations team on improving interaction with residents. At a news conference here last week, he acknowledged some of the problems.

“I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,” Chief Jackson said, adding that “race relations is a top priority right now.” As for working the with Justice Department, he said, “I told them, ‘Tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’ ”

Although experience and statistics suggest that Ferguson’s police force disproportionately targets blacks, it is not as imbalanced as in some neighboring departments in St. Louis County. While blacks are 37 percent more likely to be pulled over compared with their proportion of the population in Ferguson, that is less than the statewide average of 59 percent, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.In fact, Mr. Rosenfeld said, Ferguson did not fit the profile of a community that would be a spark for civil unrest. The town has “pockets of disadvantage” and middle and upper-middle income families. He said Ferguson had benefited in the last five to 10 years from economic growth in the northern part of the county, such as the expansion of Express Scripts, the Fortune 500 health care giant.“Ferguson does not stand out as the type of community where you would expect tensions with the police to boil over into violence and looting,” Mr. Rosenfeld said.

But the memory of the region’s racial history lingers.In 1949, a mob of whites showed up to attack blacks who lined up to get into the pool at Fairground Park in north St. Louis after it had been desegregated.In the 1970s, a court battle over public school inequality led to a settlement that created a desegregation busing program that exists to this day.A Ferguson city councilman caused a stir in 1970 when he used racially charged language to criticize teenagers from the neighboring town of Kinloch for throwing rocks and bottles at homes in Ferguson. The councilman, Carl Kersting, said, “We should call a black a black, and not be afraid to face up to these people,” according to an article in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.Eventually blacks broke down the barriers in the inner ring of suburbs, and whites fled farther out. But whites fought hard to protect their turf.In the mid-1970s, Alyce Herndon, a black woman, moved with her family to what was then the mostly white town of Jennings in St. Louis County. She said some of their white neighbors stuck an Afro pick in their front lawn and set it on fire. Ms. Herndon also recalled tensions flaring between black and white students at her school after the television mini-series “Roots” first aired in 1977.

For all its segregation and discrimination, St. Louis did not have the major riots and unrest during the 1960s that was seen across the country.

St. Louis’s black leaders “were able to pressure businesses and schools to open their doors to black people and employers to hire black workers,” Stefan Bradley, the director of African-American studies at St. Louis University, wrote in an email. “These concessions may have been enough to prevent St. Louis from taking what many believed to be the next step toward redress of injustice: violent rebellion.”But the fatal shooting of Mr. Brown has brought submerged tensions to the surface.“St. Louis never has had its true race moment, where they had to confront this,” said Ms. Bynes, the Democratic committeewoman. Without that moment, she added, blacks have been complacent when it comes to local politics. “I’m hoping that this is what it takes to get the pendulum to swing the other way.”Ms. Herndon, 49, said she moved her family to Ferguson in 2003 because she felt it was a good community, safer than the unincorporated portion of the county where they lived previously and with better schools for her children.The town, she said, offers everything — places to shop, eat and drink. There is a farmers market on Saturdays. She frequents a wine bar across from a lot where a band plays on Fridays. She has white and Asian neighbors on either side of her, and there are other black families on her block. She has not experienced the racial tensions of her childhood in St. Louis County, she said, but she understands that the younger generation is living a different experience than she is.“I understand the anger because it’s psychological trauma when you see so many people being shot or people being falsely accused,” said Ms. Herndon, who over the past week has avoided the streets that have been filled with tear gas and rubber bullets in clashes between police and protesters.But now, a population of young black men who often feel forgotten actually feel that people are finally listening.“If it wasn’t for the looting,” said one man, who declined to give his name, “we wouldn’t get the attention.”Mr. Moore went one step further. He does not condone the violence that erupted during some of the protests, he said, but he does understand the frustration. And if he were younger, he said, he probably would have joined them.

Don’t expect to see Michael Strahan’s handsome face on any more commercials.
As part of his deal to join “Good Morning America” full-time, Strahan — who’s hawked brands from Pizza Hut to Metamucil — will have to drop his endorsement deals, Page Six has learned.
The move to dump his advertising efforts is being made because, when Strahan jumped from ABC’s “Live With Kelly and Michael” to “GMA,” he effectively became an employee under the ABC News division, which forbids staffers from endorsements. On his former Disney/ABC Domestic Television show with Kelly Ripa, Strahan wasn’t subject to the same rules. (Ripa does ads for brands including Colgate toothpaste and Electrolux appliances.)
The hunky former Giants player has been a one-man branding machine, previously starring in commercials for products from Subway, Pizza Hut, Metamucil, Snickers, Dr. Pepper and Right Guard, among others.
But an ABC rep said Strahan’s endorsement deals will end “in the next few months” and will not be renewed.
However, he will be able to continue working on a line of suits designed with J.C. Penney that he launched in 2015. In May, the chain said Strahan would create a new “activewear line,” MSX.








An ABC spokesperson told us of the move: “Michael’s endorsements are set to expire in the next few months and won’t be renewed. His clothing line [with J.C. Penney] will continue, and he’s held to the same disclosure standard as anyone else at ABC News.”
The rep added, “If there is a story we’re reporting that involves a conflict of interest or a perception of conflict, Michael won’t cover it, or it will be disclosed on-air.”
Either way, busy Strahan can make up any cash loss with a new gig hosting relaunched game show “The $100,000 Pyramid.”
Current Giants star Victor Cruz recently said of Strahan at Cannes Lions, “Michael Strahan is the template for everything now, and the deals and opportunities will only get bigger for athletes.”

About Michael Kors





















   FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS OF $50 OR MORE. DETAILS    FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS OF $50 OR MORE.  DETAILS US-ENFind a StoreWish ListBagShow Mini CartSearch×  About Us Michael Kors is a world-renowned, award-winning designer of luxury accessories and ready-to-wear. His namesake company, established in 1981, currently produces a range of products under his signature Michael Kors Collection and MICHAEL Michael Kors labels. These products include accessories, footwear, watches, jewelry, men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, eyewear and a full line of fragrance products.  Michael Kors stores are operated, either directly or through licensing partners, in some of the most prestigious cities in the world, including New York, Beverly Hills, Chicago, London, Milan, Paris, Munich, Istanbul, Dubai, Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Rio de Janeiro. Behind this burgeoning empire stands a singular designer with an innate sense of glamour and an unfailing eye for timeless chic. Michael Kors has won numerous accolades within the fashion industry, been honored for his philanthropy, and earned the respect and affection of millions. Wholly dedicated to a vision of style that is as sophisticated as it is indulgent, as iconic as it is modern, he has created an enduring luxury lifestyle empire with a global reach. Michael Kors has always been involved in philanthropy, fighting hunger for more than 20 years. A longtime supporter of God’s Love We Deliver, he has worked with the New York-based organization to help distribute meals to people with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other serious illnesses. In 2013, he partnered with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to help fight world hunger by designing the 100 Series watch. A portion of the proceeds from his special-edition timepiece helps WFP deliver food to children through its school meals program.    The Diverse World of Michael Kors 			MICHAEL KORS prides itself on hiring and retaining diverse talent and providing an inclusive work environment for all. We aim to ensure that the workplace is one where all employees feel they can contribute to their maximum potential to help drive our success, and that our workforce reflects the diversity, experiences and perspectives of the people in the countries where we do business.		 			We are an equal opportunity employer. Michael Kors prohibits discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other protected class.		 			At Michael Kors, we proactively celebrate global events and cultures with the aim of building awareness and acceptance amongst our employees.		 			To help drive efforts in this area, the Company has formed a Global Diversity Council, with representation by employees from around the world. As a whole, the Council provides valuable input on diversity and inclusion topics and shares feedback from all of the Company’s operating regions. Our Council members also educate and drive diversity and inclusion initiatives at a local level.		  ©2017 Michael KorsPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsCookies/Ad Choices

Bring Generosity To The Table
UncommonGoods and New York-based food rescue organization City Harvest proudly present the Plate with PurposeTM. Chosen from over 90 entries in the Harvest Plate Design Challenge, graphic designer Michael White's iconic design garnered the community vote for uniquely capturing City Harvest's generosity of spirit. White's compassionate cityscape reminds us that food is essential--everyone deserves a helping with heart. 
Each plate is hand-cut from pre-consumer, post-industrial recycled glass and hand-screened with color. Handmade in Pennsylvania.

$5 from every purchase of this plate directly benefits City Harvest. Now serving New York City for more than 30 years, City Harvest is the world's first food rescue organization, dedicated to feeding the city's hungry men, women, and children. This year, City Harvest will collect 46 million pounds of excess food from all segments of the food industry, including restaurants, grocers, corporate cafeterias, manufacturers, and farms. This food is then delivered free of charge to some 400 community food programs throughout New York City by a fleet of trucks and bikes. City Harvest helps feed the more than one million New Yorkers that face hunger each year.
