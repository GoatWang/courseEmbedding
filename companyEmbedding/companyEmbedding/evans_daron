RIVER EDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nephros, Inc. (OTCQB:NEPH), a commercial stage medical device company 
      that develops and sells high performance liquid purification 
      ultrafilters and an on-line mid-dilution hemodiafiltration system for 
      use with a hemodialysis machine for the treatment of chronic renal 
      failure patients, announced today that Daron Evans has been appointed 
      President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective upon Mr. Evans’s 
      appointment, Dr. Paul Mieyal stepped down as acting CEO of Nephros and 
      will remain as a member of the company’s board of directors. 
      Additionally, Lawrence Centella has been appointed Chairman of the Board 
      of Directors.
    


      “We appreciate Paul’s leadership through this period of transition, 
      especially in creating strong momentum for 2015 by capitalizing on the 
      510K clearance of our hospital ultrapure filters,” said Mr. Centella. 
      “We are pleased to have Daron join in a full-time operational role and

      “Nephros has a unique opportunity to impact patients’ lives on two 
      fronts. Our partnership with leaders in the hospital water treatment 
      market will put our point-of-delivery ultrapure water filters on the 
      front line of infection control,” said Mr. Evans. “Separately, our 
      hemodiafiltration technology and our ultrapure dialysis filters have the 
      potential to improve the standard of care in certain patients with end 
      stage kidney disease. I am excited to join the management team at 
      Nephros to capitalize on our opportunity to both help patients and 
      reward shareholders for their commitment.”

About Nephros, Inc.


      Nephros is a commercial stage medical device company that develops and 
      sells high performance liquid purification filters. Our filters, which 
      we call ultrafilters, are primarily used in dialysis centers for the 
      removal of biological contaminants from water, bicarbonate concentrate 
      and/or blood.
    

      We were founded in 1997 by healthcare professionals affiliated with 
      Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital to 
      develop and commercialize an alternative method to hemodialysis (HD). We 
      have extended our filtration technologies to meet the demand for liquid 
      purification in other areas, in particular water purification.
    

      Presently, we offer ultrafilters for sale to customers in five markets:
    


Dialysis Centers - Water/Bicarbonate: Filtration of water or 
        bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis devices
      

Dialysis Centers - Blood: Treatment of patients with chronic 
        renal failure using the OLPūr H2H Hemodiafiltration (“HDF”) Module in 
        conjunction with a UF controlled hemodialysis machine and its 
        accessories, the H2H Module accessories, appropriately prepared water 
        and ultrapure dialysate for hemodialysis and the OLPūr MD 220 
        Hemodiafilter
      

Hospitals and Other Healthcare Facilities: Filtration of water 
        to be used for patient washing and drinking as an aid in infection 
        control. The filters also produce water that is suitable for wound 
        cleansing, cleaning of equipment used in medical procedures and 
        washing of surgeon’s hands
      

Military and Outdoor Recreation: Highly compact, individual 
        water purification devices used by soldiers and backpackers to produce 
        drinking water in the field
      

Commercial Facilities: Filtration of water for washing and 
        drinking including use in ice machines and soda fountains

      claims or proceedings by consumers, the FDA or other regulatory 
      authorities which may adversely impact our sales and revenues; (vii) we 
      may encounter problems with our suppliers, manufacturers and 
      distributors; (viii) we may encounter unanticipated internal control 
      deficiencies or weaknesses or ineffective disclosure controls and

About Nephros, Inc.
Nephros is a commercial stage medical device company that develops and sells high performance liquid purification filters. Our filters, which we call ultrafilters, are primarily used in dialysis centers and healthcare facilities for the production of ultrapure water and bicarbonate.
We were founded in 1997 by healthcare professionals affiliated with Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital to develop and commercialize an alternative method to hemodialysis (HD). In 2009, we began to extend our filtration technologies to meet the demand for liquid purification in other areas, in particular water purification.
Presently, we offer seven types of ultrafilters for sale to customers in four markets:

Dialysis Centers – Water/Bicarbonate: Treatment of both water and bicarbonate for the production of ultrapure dialysate
Hospitals and Other Healthcare Facilities: As part of a multi-barrier approach to help minimize exposure to waterborne contaminants
Military: Highly compact, individual water purification devices used by soldiers to produce safe drinking water in the field
Dialysis Centers – Blood: Clearance of toxins from blood using an alternative method to HD in patients with chronic renal failure

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains certain “forward-looking statements.” Such statements include statements that are not historical facts, including statements which may be preceded by the words “intends,” “may,” “will,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “estimates,” “aims,” “believes,” “hopes,” “potential” or similar words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, are based on certain assumptions and are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements.
Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the risks that:

we may not be able to continue as a going concern;
the voluntary recalls of point of use (POU) and DSU in-line ultrafilters used in hospital water treatment applications and the related circumstances could subject us to claims or proceedings which may adversely impact our sales and revenues;
we face significant challenges in obtaining market acceptance of our products, which could adversely affect our potential sales and revenues;
there are product-related deaths or serious injuries or product malfunctions, which could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products;
we face potential liability associated with the production, marketing and sale of our products, and/or the expense of defending against claims of product liability, could materially deplete our assets and generate negative publicity which could impair our reputation;
to the extent our products or marketing materials are found to violate any provisions of the FDC Act or any other statutes or regulations, then we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental agencies;
we may not be able to obtain funding if and when needed or on terms favorable to us in order to continue operations;
we may not have sufficient capital to successfully implement our business plan;
we may not be able to effectively market our products;
we may not be able to sell our water filtration products or chronic renal failure therapy products at competitive prices or profitably;
we may encounter problems with our suppliers, manufacturers and distributors;
we may encounter unanticipated internal control deficiencies or weaknesses or ineffective disclosure controls and procedures;
we may not obtain appropriate or necessary regulatory approvals to achieve our business plan;
products that appeared promising to us in research or clinical trials may not demonstrate anticipated efficacy, safety or cost savings in subsequent preclinical or clinical trials;
we may not be able to secure or enforce adequate legal protection, including patent protection, for our products; and
we may not be able to achieve sales growth in key geographic markets.

More detailed information about the Company and the risk factors that may affect the realization of forward-looking statements, including the forward-looking statements in this press release, is set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 and our other periodic reports filed with the SEC. We urge you to read those documents free of charge at the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. We do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
