Vitality Biopharma (“Vitality”) (OTCQB: VBIO) is a cure development company, dedicated to unlocking the power of cannabinoid “prodrugs” as a means to treat serious neurological and inflammatory disorders. We are interested in drug approvals first and foremost, but our overarching mission is to improve the lives of patients afflicted with devastating neurological and inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, narcotic bowel syndrome, and multiple sclerosis.  In our programs, we aim to go beyond merely providing symptomatic relief to patients afflicted with these disorders, and to instead provide targeted therapies that can provide long-term or durable relief, as well as even help them recover lost function.
Prodrugs are medications or compounds that, after administration, are converted within the body into a pharmacologically active drug, which may already have a long history of clinical investigation and use. Because the reference drug already has independent verification of its safety and efficacy, some prodrugs may be approved rapidly through demonstrating similar bioavailability or bioequivalence.  At the same time, a prodrug can be far more marketable due to its ability to eliminate unwanted side effects or undesirable commercial aspects.  In our case, targeted delivery could enable oral drug formulations of cannabinoids that provide therapeutic benefits while reducing or avoiding the systemic delivery of THC into the bloodstream.  A classic prodrug example is Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, which was first made by Felix Hoffmann at Bayer in 1897 and is a synthetic prodrug of salicylic acid.  As of 2015, there were approximately 15 prodrugs that had been classified as blockbusters, defined as having annual sales in excess of $1 billion.
One of the most hotly pursued cannabinoids for pharmaceutical purposes is cannabidiol, which is non-psychotropic, and has demonstrated therapeutic effects in clinical trials for serious neurological conditions including rare seizure disorders and for alleviating symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Our prodrugs could exert the same beneficial therapeutic effects, but with notable improvements, such as a better tasting formulation that enables improved patient compliance, better oral bioavailability that provides safer and more reliable dosing, or a delayed release mechanism that enables patients using these medications to have long-lasting, overnight relief. Given that we have recently filed intellectual property applications including strong composition of matter claims for more than 20 cannabinoid prodrugs, including versions of THC, CBD, and CBDV, we have demonstrated the ability to create a proprietary prodrug of every significant cannabinoid pharmaceutical available today.

          A Breakthrough in Glycosylation        










Platform Technology 



Platform Technology

Targeted Delivery
Glycoside Prodrugs
Cannabinoid Prodrugs










In 2013, we developed a proprietary enzymatic biosynthesis production system in order to improve the taste of stevia, a natural compound used as a high-potency sweetener. This platform harnesses a naturally-occurring biological process known as glycosylation, which involves using enzymes to attach glucose (sugars) to small-molecule compounds. Over the last 10 years or so, it has become well appreciated within the pharmaceutical industry that glycosylation can act to generate new natural product libraries with improved drug properties. This platform technology enables us to readily modify existing drug compounds, especially natural products, in order to give them attractive new drug properties.
Using our proprietary glycosylation platform, we’ve now been able to produce and characterize more than 20 novel cannabinoid glycosides, or “cannabosides”, which are novel drug candidates that represent a new class of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals. It is well established that cannabis can provide relief of pain and inflammation in certain disease indications, and our prodrugs could exert the same beneficial therapeutic effects, but with notable improvements, such as targeted drug delivery that avoids or reduces psychoactivity. Targeted delivery through glycosylation may enable selective delivery of compounds to the brain or gut, markedly improving the side effect profile or bioavailability of existing drugs.
Vitality has filed intellectual property applications and is seeking worldwide patent protection through 2035 with strong composition of matter claims for prodrugs of THC, CBD, and CBDV, as well as for its proprietary prodrug biosynthesis platform utilizing enzymatic glycosylation.

VITALITY BIOPHARMA, INC (OTCMKTS:VBIO) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Securities Purchase Agreement
On July 26, 2017, Vitality Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with the purchasers identified therein (collectively, the “Purchasers”) providing for the issuance and sale by the Company to the Purchasers of an aggregate of 666,667 shares of the Companys common stock (collectively, the Shares”), and warrants to purchase up to 333,334 shares of the Companys common stock (the “Warrants”, and the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, collectively, the “Warrant Shares”) at a price of $1.50 per share (the “Offering”). After deducting for fees and expenses, the aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the Shares and Warrants is approximately $995,000.
 to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, each Purchaser will be issued one share of the Companys common stock and a Warrant to purchase up to one-half of one share of the Companys common stock. Each Warrant has an exercise price of $2.00 per share, is immediately exercisable, and will expire on the three year anniversary of the date of issuance, which is July 26, 2020. If the Purchasers exercise all of the Warrants within three years, the Company would receive additional aggregate net proceeds of approximately $666,668. At any time the registration statement (as discussed below) is not effective, the Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis.
The Company expects to close the Offering on July 28, 2017, and the total common shares outstanding after the issuance of the Shares is 22,931,847
Registration Rights Agreement
On July 26, 2017, the Company entered into the Registration Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) with the Purchasers  to which the Company agreed to register the Shares and the Warrant Shares (the “Registrable Securities”). The Company is required to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the Registrable Securities by August 25, 2017 (the “Filing Deadline”) and have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within one hundred twenty (120) to one hundred fifty (150) days of the Filing Deadline.
The parties to the Rights Agreement also agreed, among other things, to indemnify each other for losses that may arise based on untrue statements that may be included in the registration statement and certain other fees and expenses that the parties may incur in connection therewith. The Company will pay all expenses relating to the filing of the registration statement.
Item 3.02
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02 in its entirety.

Vitality Biopharma, Inc. Key Developments

Vitality Biopharma, Inc. Releases Positive Results for Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Jul 19 17
Vitality Biopharma, Inc. announced positive preclinical efficacy results for its gut-targeted cannabosides in the treatment of colitis. Vitality Biopharma has developed a new class of cannabinoid prodrugs, known as cannabosides, which upon ingestion can be targeted and limited to the gastrointestinal tract, thereby avoiding drug psychoactivity and unforeseen side effects. In a preclinical model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cannabosides were able to reduce weight loss, decrease damage to the colon, and markedly improve gastrointestinal health compared to the placebo controls. Vitality's cannabosides were successful in treatment of an acute model of colitis (DSS), which is traditionally viewed as very challenging, given that certain FDA-approved therapies including corticosteroids and TNF-alpha inhibitors have been shown to be ineffective for treating this model. The positive preclinical efficacy results with cannabosides are required in order for the Company to progress into first-in-man clinical trials.

It does not resolve the issue of financial viability for the company, beyond early 2018. It is a good indicator of the potential of VBIO to achieve a marketable drug that wins FDA approval. It should help VBIO to obtain additional financing necessary to continue progressing towards this goal. But questions and uncertanty remain, and so the stock is only recovering modestly from its recent downward trend.What is needed now is: 1) Resolution of the current cash flow problem the company faces, preferably in the form of private, venture capitalist monetary investment.2) positive results obtained from actual, full-blown, clinical trials. Either scenario could easily pop the stock to the $2.50-$4.00 range. FDA approval is still not on the immediate horizon, therefore long-term investors such as myself should remain patient, anticipating a 2019+ time horizon for such an event, which will, if it occurs, change everything and immediately result in a huge valuation payoff.Disclosure: Confidently long 10,000 shares at $2.60/shr, long-term investment with 2022 time horizon.MoreVitality Biopharma Releases Positive Results for Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseLOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 19, 2017) - Vitality Biopharma, Inc.

Here is a direct link:https://www.last10k.com/sec-filings/vbio#fullReportI admire and appreciate the absolute candor of the company in revealing the financial situation it is in. The stock is down today, based upon these statement, IMO. But, if you read the full filing, you get a good understanding of how much progress VBIO has made over the past year, in R&D, and in setting the stage for full-blown clinical trials, beginning very soon, this year. Of course the risk that this company will fail, is very real and must be openly acknowledged. But I think that an unbiased analysis of the full content of this 10-K filing demonstrates the honesty of management, and their determination to bring a pharmaceutical drug to market.

They are doing many things right, but a few things wrong, and they seem unable or unwilling to realize and change their mistakes. In the long run, these mistakes should not impact their potential to achieve great success, but still it is frustrating. They are not a pump and dump. They do have valuable proprietary information and research, they have hired excellent people in recent months to help them realize the creation and the successful marketing of cannabinoid-based medical drugs. Their chances of success have greatly increased in recent months. Yet they continue to try to pump up their share price with crudely worded, paid press releases that make them look bad to even the modestly sophisticated investor. Still, the share price has remained level. Why? Because the impartial investor recognizes the immense potential of the company to generate huge profits within the next 2-4 years. I just wish Robert Brooke and other company leaders would grow up a bit and realize there are many different ways to keep this exciting company in the news and on the minds of investors, besides paying companies to rewrite old press releases in very bad English.MoreReplyReplies (2)21SStevenSomething from Brandon Zipp head of resarch at Vitality.http://zippypickle.com/wp/2017/06/17/cannabis-sativa/Cannabis sativa | Zippypickle Labszippypickle.comReply00JJameslets goReply00JJamesanything new?ReplyReplies (3)20JJohnnyI received yet another phone call today from a fella touting VBIO. 3rd one in 45 days. I did my due diligence and convinced that VBIO will not be successful. They have 8 employees, no present or foreseeable income, under a mountain of debt and have <$100k cash on their balance sheet. They have 0 patents, cannabosides have limitations, 1 test on 1 patient for test data and have a slew of competition. Until they establish technical data supporting these amusing press releases, their credibility will be suspect.ReplyReplies (2)41ccharlesVitality needs positive news, verifiable progress in terms of developing marketable drugs, be they prescription or non-prescription, based upon their cannabinoid prodrug R&D. As we have seen, positive press releases lacking verifiable progress in this regard, cannot and will not result in anything more than a temporary pop. Useful for day and momentum traders, but useless for the serious, long-term investor. I remain highly optimistic for the future, continuing to hold my 10,000 shares at $2.60 entry point, with a time horizon of 2022 for windfall profits. The technology is real, the potential is real, the patents held and the intellectual property owned, are real. But they have to deliver marketable products. For this we wait, for something beyond the optimistic press release.MoreReplyReplies (1)00CCharleswhat s going on with this stock????ReplyReplies (1)10JJamespositive results where do we go from hereReplyReplies (4)31Show MoreThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderThis game will teach youForge of EmpiresSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

Platform Technology



          A Breakthrough in Glycosylation        










Platform Technology 



Platform Technology

Targeted Delivery
Glycoside Prodrugs
Cannabinoid Prodrugs










In 2013, we developed a proprietary enzymatic biosynthesis production system in order to improve the taste of stevia, a natural compound used as a high-potency sweetener. This platform harnesses a naturally-occurring biological process known as glycosylation, which involves using enzymes to attach glucose (sugars) to small-molecule compounds. Over the last 10 years or so, it has become well appreciated within the pharmaceutical industry that glycosylation can act to generate new natural product libraries with improved drug properties. This platform technology enables us to readily modify existing drug compounds, especially natural products, in order to give them attractive new drug properties.
Using our proprietary glycosylation platform, we’ve now been able to produce and characterize more than 20 novel cannabinoid glycosides, or “cannabosides”, which are novel drug candidates that represent a new class of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals. It is well established that cannabis can provide relief of pain and inflammation in certain disease indications, and our prodrugs could exert the same beneficial therapeutic effects, but with notable improvements, such as targeted drug delivery that avoids or reduces psychoactivity. Targeted delivery through glycosylation may enable selective delivery of compounds to the brain or gut, markedly improving the side effect profile or bioavailability of existing drugs.
Vitality has filed intellectual property applications and is seeking worldwide patent protection through 2035 with strong composition of matter claims for prodrugs of THC, CBD, and CBDV, as well as for its proprietary prodrug biosynthesis platform utilizing enzymatic glycosylation.

INDUSTRIAL HEMP/July 24, 2017/104 views /OTCMKTS:VBIOVitality Biopharma IncVitality Biopharma Inc (OTCMKTS:VBIO) Vitality Biopharma Inc (OTCMKTS:VBIO) Revises Product Development Strategyshare on:FacebookTwitterVitality Biopharma Inc (OTCMKTS:VBIO) posted that for the pharmaceutical offerings in the pipeline, the active Cannabinoid pharmaceutical agents remains either in late-stage clinical phases or have been independently sanctioned by regulatory entities. There is widespread clinical report already accessible pertaining to drug efficiency and safety.
As of this, the firm will general benefit from the familiarity of clinical regulators as well as investigators with these compounds, which may permit lowered paths towards clinical testing and following nod of firm’s pharmaceutical offerings.
The buzz
CBDs are called as effective neuroprotective as well as anti-inflammatory agents, and as of last year, states in the United States constituting 87% of the U.S. population have approved medicinal marijuana regulations to permit access to medicinal cannabis for cure of distinct problems, including application of CBD at lowest level, which is not harmful.
The allowed disease indications constitute ones directly associated to the drug indications Vitality is looking to treat and many others. The list constitutes inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy, muscle spasticity disorders, chronic pain, wasting disorders, nausea, traumatic brain injury, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, HIV/AIDS, cirrhosis, Alzheimer’s disease and more.
CBD pharmaceuticals are increasingly being approved as well, counting chiefly botanical and synthetic extracts of the main constituents of Cannabis sativa, which are THC and CBD. Dronabinol can be defined as a synthetic THC medicine that has been allowed for stimulating appetite and curing nausea. Nabiximols marks a combination of two cannabinoids which have been approved in as many as 20 nations and more targeting muscle spasticity in MS, as well as for cancer pain therapy in some nations.
In the last trading session, the shares price of Vitality traded in a narrow range and closed flat at $1.99. The trading share volume was 45,927 compared to average share volume of 104,144. VBIO market cap stands close to $44 million.

Launch of Vitality Biopharma for Cannabinoid Prodrug Pharmaceutical Development
May 09, 2016




Company to Focus on Treatment of Serious Neurological and Inflammatory Conditions


  LOS ANGELES, CA--Stevia First Corp.  (OTCQB: STVF) (the "Company") is pleased to announce that it is changing its name to Vitality Biopharma, Inc. and that the Company will be dedicated to development of cannabinoid prodrug pharmaceuticals, and unlocking the power of cannabinoids for treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory disorders.

  In a recent shareholder letter available on the new corporate website at: www.vitality.bio, the Company's CEO, Robert Brooke, stated, "We have an opportunity that is impossible for us to ignore and that we believe will provide an incredibly strong foundation and help the company grow for many years to come."

  Recent research into improving the taste of stevia compounds led to the finding that the process could act equally well on a wide variety of molecules, especially natural products, including cannabinoids, and that it could act on them in ways that could dramatically improve their drug properties, including modifications to their solubility, stability, and bioavailability. This work has enabled production of proprietary prodrug versions of each of the major cannabinoids that are being tested by the medical community today for treatment of a wide variety of disorders, including epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. The Company's work has focused primarily on cannabidiol, which is not psychoactive.

  Mr. Brooke continues, "We have now generated and filed patents for more than 15 novel cannabinoid glycosides, or cannabosides, which act as part of a class of pharmaceuticals known as 'prodrugs,' and can be approved through lower-cost, abbreviated regulatory paths both internationally and in the U.S., such as the 505(b)(2) regulatory path."

  The Company has submitted plans for a new trading symbol to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and has completed related corporate actions as described in a Form 8-K. Further details of the Company's business, finances, appointments and agreements can be found as part of the Company's continuous public disclosure as a reporting issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.

About Vitality Biopharma 
  Vitality Biopharma is dedicated to unlocking the power of cannabinoids for treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory disorders. For more information, visit: www.vitality.bio.

  Stevia First Corp. (OTCQB: STVF) has received shareholder approval for a name change to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., which it expects will become effective in June 2016 after the necessary regulatory filings have been completed.

Vitality Biopharma, Inc. (OTCQB: VBIO) Breaking News -

Vitality Biopharma Advances Cannabosides 
for Treatment of Narcotic Bowel Syndrome 
 

Opiate-induced severe abdominal pain leads to escalating 
dosages and drug dependence
 
LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) - November 16, 2016 -  Vitality Biopharma, Inc. (OTCQB:
VBIO) ("Vitality 
Biopharma," "Vitality," or the "Company") a corporation dedicated to the 
development of cannabinoid prodrug pharmaceuticals, and to unlocking the power 
of cannabinoids for the treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory 
disorders, today announced that it is advancing its cannabosides pharmaceuticals 
for treatment of narcotic bowel syndrome, a severe form of opiate-induced 
abdominal pain. 

Every day more than 650,000 opioid prescriptions are dispensed by US pharmacies, 
resulting in over 200 million opioid prescriptions dispensed annually. Studies 
have reported that up to 81% of patients treated with opiates have functional 
bowel disorders, but these common symptoms may lead to underdiagnosis of 
opiate-induced severe abdominal pain. More than half (58%) of opiate users have 
reported chronic abdominal pain in independently-conducted clinical studies, and 
narcotic bowel syndrome is the most severe form of this disorder, where 
abdominal pain paradoxically increases despite continued administration of 
narcotics to treat the pain. When undiagnosed, patients or physicians continue 
to escalate dosages, which temporarily relieves pain, but leads to addiction and 
also worsens the abdominal pain – a vicious cycle. Narcotic bowel syndrome has 
dire consequences for opiate users, as their quality-of-life has been reported 
to be worse than patients with quadriplegia.

The clinical use of cannabinoids for resolving pain and inflammation is well 
established, including in large (n=313) independently-conducted clinical studies 
of inflammatory bowel disease, where 84% of patients reported an improvement in 
abdominal pain. Vitality’s proprietary cannabosides enable the selective 
delivery of cannabinoids to the intestinal tract, enabling large concentrations 
of THC and CBD (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, respectively) to be 
delivered without any resulting psychoactivity. 

“In the midst of an opiate epidemic, with no simple solution in sight, we’re 
developing a truly differentiated cannabinoid pharmaceutical product,” said 
Robert Brooke, Chief Executive Officer of Vitality Biopharma. “We are working 
with regulators and with collaborating physicians in order to expedite the 
availability of these products, and to also help raise awareness for opiate 
users afflicted with this condition.”

Recent Vitality Biopharma News:
 
Vitality Biopharma Announces International 
Patent Filing for Cannabinoid Pharmaceuticals 
 

Once concluded, IP protection extends to 2035 or longer in 
USA and all major markets worldwide
 
LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) - November 9, 2016 -  Vitality Biopharma, Inc. (OTCQB:
VBIO) ("Vitality 
Biopharma," "Vitality," or the "Company") a corporation dedicated to the 
development of cannabinoid prodrug pharmaceuticals, and to unlocking the 
power of cannabinoids for the treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory 
disorders, today announced the filing of an international PCT patent 
application, a milestone in its development of a platform of cannabinoid 
pharmaceuticals. 

The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is an international patent law treaty, which 
provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect 
inventions in each of its member states. Vitality Biopharma’s patent filing 
includes details that were previously submitted in three separate U.S. 
provisional applications, and includes 79 patent claims and almost 200 
individual compounds, including novel glycoside prodrugs of the most abundant 
phytocannabinoids, THC and cannabidiol (CBD), as well as a variety of other 
phytocannabinoids and endocannabinoids. The patent application includes 
additional compounds, such as vanilloids, a class of molecules that could 
provide sustained pain relief through targeting of the TRPV1 receptor, and 
enzymatic biosynthesis methods that the Company uses internally for drug 
manufacturing. 

There are 151 member countries within the PCT worldwide, so near global patent 
coverage can be obtained through successful patent prosecution in the U.S., 
Japan, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, Brazil, Russia, India, and 
many other countries. The original priority date for this filing was September 
22, 2015, therefore coverage of any underlying patent claims would extend for 20 
years until 2035 in the United States, and may be subject to patent term 
extensions that would enable years of additional protection.

“This is a significant milestone enabled by our team’s discovery and production 
of a versatile new portfolio of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals,” said Robert 
Brooke, Chief Executive Officer of Vitality Biopharma. “The clinical data 
emerging on the use of cannabinoids for inflammatory bowel disease, opiate 
addiction, and many other serious disorders is inspiring, and our team is now 
working internally and through collaborators to develop key therapeutic 
applications for our compounds.”

Vitality Biopharma Reports on Initial 
Cannabinoid Drug Formulation Studies 
 

Water solubility significantly improved more than 100-fold, 
enabling novel pharmaceutical applications
 
LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) --  Vitality Biopharma, Inc. (OTCQB:
VBIO) ("Vitality 
Biopharma," "Vitality," or the "Company") a corporation dedicated to the 
development of cannabinoid prodrug pharmaceuticals, and to unlocking the 
power of cannabinoids for the treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory 
disorders, today announced results of recent drug formulation studies that 
documented substantial modifications to key physiochemical properties of 
cannabinoids through the production of cannaboside prodrug pharmaceuticals.

Vitality Biopharma has demonstrated through internal drug formulation studies 
that cannabosides have versatile physical properties, enabling various compounds 
to be produced as liquids, solids, powders, as well as foams. The most 
convenient method of delivering pharmaceuticals is through oral delivery, and 
most oral cannabinoid medicinal products today must be delivered using oil-based 
liquid solutions or sprays. Because cannabinoid oils often include harsh organic 
solvents such as ethanol and propylene glycol, they can act as irritants when 
used repeatedly. This limits the amount of cannabinoids that can be delivered 
orally, and also reduces product appeal, especially for pediatric applications.

Vitality's formulations now deliver water solubility documented as high as 
500mg/ml, or roughly 50% of the mass-to-volume ratio, which represents more than 
a 100-fold improvement over the reported water solubility of most cannabinoids 
such as THC and 
cannabidiol (CBD). This improved solubility represents a novel ability to 
produce concentrated liquid cannabinoid solutions that can be delivered orally, 
for maximum convenience, and further, it enables alternative methods of 
administration such as topical, rectal, or intravenous drug formulations.

A primary target of cannaboside prodrugs is for the treatment of inflammatory 
bowel disease, an autoimmune condition where an individual's immune system 
attacks their intestines, rectum, and other parts of their digestive tract. This 
disease afflicts 1.4 million Americans and often affects children, with most 
patients receiving their diagnosis prior to age 30. As with epilepsy, dramatic 
clinical trial results have been documented through the use of cannabinoids, 
including an ability to induce remission of Crohn's disease. Large state-funded 
and independently-managed clinical trials are now underway to further document 
and analyze these therapeutic effects, and many states have now approved medical 
marijuana for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including Colorado, 
California, Ohio, and more than a dozen others. Vitality Biopharma's cannabinoid 
prodrugs enable the targeted delivery of cannabinoids directly to the site of 
disease, enabling larger drug concentrations to be used while simultaneously 
reducing or avoiding psychoactivity altogether. This could lead to their 
widespread use as pharmaceuticals that provide the same therapeutic benefits as 
medical marijuana, or more, and yet do so without any debilitating or unwanted 
side effects.

Vitality Biopharma Develops Cannabinoid Alternatives to Opiate Prescription Pain 
Medications
 

Cannabosides Enable Targeted Pain Relief and Avoid 
Psychoactivity of THC Through Site-Specific Delivery
LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 10/19/16 -- Vitality Biopharma, Inc. 
(OTCQB: VBIO) 
("Vitality Biopharma," "Vitality," or the "Company") a corporation dedicated to 
the development of cannabinoid prodrug pharmaceuticals, and to unlocking 
the power of cannabinoids for the treatment of serious neurological and 
inflammatory disorders, wishes to advise that a recent article written by Robert 
Brooke, Company CEO, sheds new light on key factors in the fight against the 
increasing epidemic of prescription painkiller related deaths.

In his article, Mr. Brooke notes, "Opiates are one of the key classes of drugs 
we're seeking to replace, or to make far less necessary, as our proprietary 
cannabosides could provide a potent alternative form of pain relief and help 
avoid, or greatly reduce, the use of opiates for the treatment of many 
conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (where 70% of patients now 
regularly receive opiates upon hospitalization)."

The statistics are startling, as last year there were 47,055 Americans that died 
from drug overdoses, and opioids were involved in 61% of these cases. Since 
2013, the rates of drug-overdose deaths have exceeded the number of deaths from 
car accidents. This is not uniquely an American problem, but the U.S. uses an 
astonishing 80% of the world's opioids, while representing only 4.6% of the 
world's population. The New England Journal of Medicine has just written that 
the rising death toll has been rivaled in modern history only by that at the 
peak of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1990s.

On Friday, the Washington Post reported that an Arizona-based maker of fentanyl, 
the drug most commonly reported in many of these deaths, just donated $500,000 
to oppose legalization of medical marijuana. This at a time when studies 
have shown that today about 75% to 86% of heroin users started with prescription 
opioid pain relievers. So the first exposure to opiates is far more likely to 
come not from heroin (as was overwhelmingly true in the 1960's), but rather from 
prescription drugs.

About Vitality Biopharma, Inc.

 

Vitality Biopharma is developing proprietary cannabinoid pharmaceuticals for 
treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory disorders, such as 
inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.

Meeting Pharmaceutical Market Demands

Vitality is developing proprietary cannabinoid pharmaceuticals that are 
compliant with FDA and DEA regulations. Oral cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are a 
convenient and desirable option for patients and physicians, and they could help 
realize the full therapeutic potential of cannabinoid medicines.

A Low-Cost, Low-Risk Regulatory Strategy

Oral prodrugs enable a regulatory strategy with lower risk that is akin to 
specialty pharmaceutical development. The company benefits from existing 
clinical studies of cannabinoids demonstrating their effectiveness in treating 
in IBD, MS, pain, epilepsy, and additional disease indications.

Healthcare & Life Sciences Expertise

Senior management is entrepreneurial with a track record in healthcare and drug 
development. Laboratory and manufacturing operations are based in Northern 
California, and the R&D team includes passionate scientists, medical advisers, 
and regulatory affairs specialists.

Cannabosides – A New Class of Cannabinoid Pharmaceuticals

Vitality Biopharma has developed a new class of cannabinoid prodrugs, known as 
cannabosides, which upon ingestion can enable the selective delivery of THC and 
cannabidiol (CBD) to the gastrointestinal tract. Site-specific delivery could 
enable oral drug formulations of cannabinoids to provide therapeutic benefits 
while reducing or avoiding the systemic delivery of THC into the bloodstream. 
Currently, high concentrations of psychoactive THC in the brain limit the dose 
of cannabinoids that can be used elsewhere in the body for treatment of pain and 
inflammation.

Independent clinical trial results suggest that cannabinoids will help induce 
remission in Crohn’s disease patients, and that the vast majority of 
inflammatory bowel disease patients experience symptomatic relief, including 
more than 75% of patients who report improvement in visceral pain and abdominal 
cramping. Approximately 1.4 million Americans are affected

by 
inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. 
Most patients are diagnosed before age 30 and require life-long treatment.

In addition to providing targeted delivery, cannabosides could enable a better 
tasting formulation for improved patient compliance, better oral bioavailability 
that provides safer and more reliable dosing, and a delayed release mechanism 
that enables patients using these medications to have long-lasting, overnight 
relief.

A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized 
(i.e., converted within the body) into a pharmacologically active drug. Prodrugs 
are often designed to improve bioavailability when a drug itself is poorly 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, or to overcome other issues that make 
molecules unappealing candidates for future development efforts. A prodrug may 
for instance be used to selectively target a specific tissue or organ, such as 
the brain or gut, which enables the drug to have a more targeted effect. 
Prodrugs have been around for a while, with Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, first 
made by Felix Hoffmann at Bayer in 1897, a classic example of a synthetic 
prodrug of salicylic acid. As of 2015, there were approximately 15 prodrugs that 
had been classified as blockbusters, defined as having annual sales in excess of 
$1 billion.

Our Technology
A Breakthrough in Glycosylation

Through extensive research in the natural sweetener industry, we pioneered 
industrial-scale processes to modify stevia to make it taste better. This 
process is known as glycosylation, which involves adding additional glucose 
molecules to it, and it modifies both the taste and solubility of it. Over the 
last 10 years or so, it has become appreciated within the pharmaceutical 
industry that glycosylation could act to generate new natural product libraries 
with improved drug properties. This process for modifying natural products to 
make them more useful is often called glycorandomization, or 
glycodiversification.

Using the same technology, we’ve now been able to produce and characterize more 
than 20 novel cannabinoid glycosides, or “cannabosides”, which are novel 
cannabinoid prodrug pharmaceuticals. As an example, one of the most hotly 
pursued cannabinoids for pharmaceutical purposes is cannabidiol, which is 
non-psychotropic, and has potential therapeutic effects in a wide variety of 
serious neurological and inflammatory conditions. Our prodrugs could exert the 
same beneficial therapeutic effects, but with notable improvements, such as 
site-specific delivery that avoids or reduces psychoactivity, a better tasting 
formulation for improved patient compliance, better oral bioavailability that 
provides safer and more reliable dosing, and a delayed release mechanism that 
could enable long-lasting, overnight relief.

Vitality has filed intellectual property applications including strong 
composition of matter claims for prodrugs of THC, CBD, and CBDV, creating 
proprietary prodrugs of every significant cannabinoid pharmaceutical available 
today.

Cannabosides – A New Class of Cannabinoid Pharmaceuticals
Vitality Biopharma has developed a new class of cannabinoid prodrugs, known as cannabosides, which upon ingestion can enable the selective delivery of THC and cannabidiol (CBD) to the gastrointestinal tract.
Site-specific delivery could enable oral drug formulations of cannabinoids to provide therapeutic benefits while reducing or avoiding the systemic delivery of THC into the bloodstream. Currently, high concentrations of psychoactive THC in the brain limit the dose of cannabinoids that can be used elsewhere in the body for treatment of pain and inflammation.
Independent clinical trial results suggest that cannabinoids will help induce remission in Crohn’s disease patients, and that the vast majority of inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”) patients experience symptomatic relief, including 84% of patients who report improvement in visceral or abdominal pain. Approximately 1.4 million Americans have IBD, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Most patients are diagnosed before age 30 and require life-long treatment.
A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized (i.e., converted within the body) into a pharmacologically active drug. Prodrugs are typically designed to overcome well-known drawbacks of currently available therapies.  Vitality’s prodrug technology enables the selective targeting of specific tissues or organs, including the gut or brain, enabling the drug to have a more targeted effect.  As of 2015, there were approximately 15 prodrugs that had been classified as blockbusters, defined as having annual sales in excess of $1 billion.


“CB2 receptors represent a braking system… for the resolution of inflammation and many of its symptoms.  CB2 receptor activation therefore represents a very promising therapeutic target in gastrointestinal inflammatory states where there is immune activation and motility dysfunction.”
Wright, Duncan, & Sharkey., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2008.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
