An Expanding Product Portfolio
Impax’s ongoing strategy to invest in R&D and to develop high-value opportunities should continue to provide the potential for growth in the future.
Our Products
We operate in two segments, referred to as Impax Generics and Impax Specialty Pharma. Impax Generics concentrates its efforts on generic products, which are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of brand-name drug products and are usually marketed under their established nonproprietary drug names rather than by a brand name. Impax Specialty Pharma utilizes its specialty sales force to market proprietary branded pharmaceutical products for the treatment of Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders and other select specialty segments.
Within our Generics Division, we market:
We currently market over 70 generic products including, but are not limited to, budesonide inhalation suspension, epinephrine auto-injector (www.epinephrineautoinject.com) (generic to Adrenaclick®), fenofibrate, mixed amphetamine salts and oxymorphone hydrochloride.
Impax currently markets its generic products under several labels including Impax, Global Pharmaceuticals, Core Pharmaceuticals and Lineage Therapeutics.
A list of our currently marketed generic products can be found by visiting:

Dedicated to Pharmaceutical Innovation
Impax Laboratories is a technology-based specialty pharmaceutical company utilizing our core competency in drug delivery and formulation expertise. We have a balanced business model consisting of a successful generic business targeting high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA), and a branded business currently focused on internally developing Central Nervous System (CNS) products where we can deliver meaningful patient benefits and develop strong intellectual property positions.

Research Areas
We have a dual strategic focus that stretches across our generic division and our branded division.
Our generic business strategy is focused on targeting high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability. We explore a broad range of therapeutic areas that have technically challenging drug delivery mechanisms or other niches, including products with the potential for six months of exclusivity for being first-to-file or first-to-market.
Our brand business strategy is focused on CNS disorders. We are applying our formulation expertise and clinical development experience to develop differentiated, modified or controlled-release versions of currently marketed drug products.

Growth Strategy
We are focused on adding to the growth our own innovations will bring with acquisitions of external growth opportunities. Our business development activities are focusing on technologies in new dosage forms, or products or companies where our core competency in creative technologies and methods can result in synergies from further technical innovation. These could be in either generic or proprietary opportunities complementary to our own creative efforts.

Our Two Corporate Divisions
We have two platforms that offer the right balance for future growth. Our vision is to target key areas of growth that reflect both our internal strengths, and a strong market, treatment or product need.

Our Generics Division
In the generic pharmaceuticals market, we utilize our core competency in drug delivery expertise and formulation development to target high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form (ADF) ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability. This includes products with the potential for six months of exclusivity for being first-to-file or products that are difficult to develop. Externally, we are aggressively looking at Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Agreements, as well as opportunities to acquire products, technologies or companies with strategic value mainly in the alternative dosage area, such as injectables, creams and ointments, inhalers or patches.
Continue reading

Specialty Pharma Division
In the brand name pharmaceuticals market, we are focused on internally developing Central Nervous System (CNS) disorder products where we can deliver meaningful patient benefits and develop strong intellectual property positions. We believe the successful development of our brand business is critical to our future growth as brand products provide longer product life cycles with the potential for higher profits. Our strategic initiatives for growth include continuing our internal R&D focus on neurology by building a strong pipeline. In addition, we are searching for external growth opportunities through partnerships and M&A in CNS.

Impax Generics
Our Generics Division
View website
Impax has developed a portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals through the internal filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and through partnerships on alternative dosage form products. Our generic product development strategy is based on a combination of speed to filing and a legal strategy primarily predicated upon non-infringement of established brand name pharmaceuticals. We are focused on targeting high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability.
Global’s multi-source product line consists of a growing range of solid oral and alternative dosage form prescription pharmaceuticals, distributed primarily through drug wholesalers, distributors, warehousing chains and managed healthcare organizations.
The organization continues to invest in order to provide the highest level of research and development, manufacturing and customer service. Our quality assurance team works closely with our suppliers to ensure purity, consistency and quality of products, and we strive to bring value to our customers with innovative products in key therapeutic areas.
We have a dedicated team of experienced professionals handling customer orders and inquiries that work to not only meet the expectations of our customers, but consistently deliver beyond expectations. Every member of our team is committed to the success and profitability of our customers. We have set the highest standards for our products, services and people, and are proud of the organization we are building.
We develop, manufacture, sell and distribute generic pharmaceutical products primarily through three sales channels:

Product sales channel, for generic pharmaceutical prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers, large retail drug chains, mass merchandisers and mail-order pharmacies
Rx Partner sales channel, for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities pursuant to alliance agreements
OTC Partner sales channel, for sales of generic pharmaceutical OTC products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities pursuant to alliance agreements.


Product Development Strategy
Our generic product development strategy is based on two opportunities we've identified in the generic pharmaceutical marketplace:

Controlled-Release Generic Products
Through our controlled-release drug delivery technologies and formulation skills we develop bioequivalent versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals. Controlled-release pharmaceuticals generally have technically challenging drug delivery requirements. We employ our proprietary processes and formulation expertise to develop products that reproduce the brand name product’s physiological characteristics, but do not infringe upon the brand product’s patents.
Specialty Generic Products
Products that present one or more competitive barriers to entry, such as difficulty sourcing raw material, complex formulation or development characteristics, or special handling requirements.

Our Products
We currently manufacture and market 207 generic pharmaceutical products, which represent dosage variations of 72 different pharmaceutical compounds through our Generics Division; another five of our generic pharmaceutical products representing dosage variations of two different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance agreement partners.
Our Pipeline
We currently have more than 20 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) pending at the FDA. We are also working on a number of products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed.

The lot number can be found on the side of the manufacturer’s carton as well as on the blister cards within the unit-of-use blister packs.

History[edit]
The company’s predecessor entity, privately held Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was founded in 1995. Publicly traded Global Pharmaceutical Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a reverse merger, forming Impax Laboratories, Inc. on December 14, 1999.[2]
The merger combined the advanced drug delivery systems developed by Impax Pharmaceuticals through its research and development capabilities with Global Pharmaceutical’s sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In March 2015, Impax completed its acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. (including operating subsidiaries CorePharma LLC and Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC including its Adrenaclick epinephrine autoinjector), and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Impax reshaped the operating and reporting structure of its two divisions into Impax Generics and Impax Specialty Pharma.[1][4]
In June 2016, the company acquired 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which are close to market, for $586 million from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
Impax Generics includes the company’s legacy Global Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired CorePharma and Lineage Therapeutics businesses. Impax Specialty Pharma includes the legacy Impax Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired Amedra Pharmaceuticals business.[7]
Impax’s Generics Division focuses on a broad range of therapeutic areas, including products having technically challenging drug-delivery mechanisms or unique product formulations. In addition to developing solid oral dosage products, the company’s portfolio includes alternative dosage form products, primarily through alliance and collaboration agreements with third parties.[1]
The company’s Specialty Pharma Division is focused on the development and promotion, through the company’s specialty sales force, of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products for the treatment of Central Nervous System disorders and other select specialty segments.[1]
The Impax Specialty Pharma Division currently has one internally developed branded pharmaceutical product, RYTARY (IPX066), an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015.[8]
Regulatory and litigation[edit]
Several wholesale lots of Impax's 200 mg fenofibrate capsules were recalled in March 2011.[9][10]
Impax and DAVA Pharmaceuticals engaged in a legal dispute with Purdue Pharma over the patents and production of time-released oxycodone (OxyContin) until reaching an agreement in April 2007.[11] Another dispute with Endo Pharmaceuticals and Penwest Pharmaceuticals concluded with Impax gaining the right to begin producing extended-release oxymorphone through its Global Pharmaceuticals division as of 2013.[12][13]
Impax announced the resolution of its FDA warning letter for its Hayward, CA facility on September 8, 2015.[14]

History[edit]
The company’s predecessor entity, privately held Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was founded in 1995. Publicly traded Global Pharmaceutical Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a reverse merger, forming Impax Laboratories, Inc. on December 14, 1999.[2]
The merger combined the advanced drug delivery systems developed by Impax Pharmaceuticals through its research and development capabilities with Global Pharmaceutical’s sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In March 2015, Impax completed its acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. (including operating subsidiaries CorePharma LLC and Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC including its Adrenaclick epinephrine autoinjector), and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Impax reshaped the operating and reporting structure of its two divisions into Impax Generics and Impax Specialty Pharma.[1][4]
In June 2016, the company acquired 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which are close to market, for $586 million from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
Impax Generics includes the company’s legacy Global Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired CorePharma and Lineage Therapeutics businesses. Impax Specialty Pharma includes the legacy Impax Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired Amedra Pharmaceuticals business.[7]
Impax’s Generics Division focuses on a broad range of therapeutic areas, including products having technically challenging drug-delivery mechanisms or unique product formulations. In addition to developing solid oral dosage products, the company’s portfolio includes alternative dosage form products, primarily through alliance and collaboration agreements with third parties.[1]
The company’s Specialty Pharma Division is focused on the development and promotion, through the company’s specialty sales force, of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products for the treatment of Central Nervous System disorders and other select specialty segments.[1]
The Impax Specialty Pharma Division currently has one internally developed branded pharmaceutical product, RYTARY (IPX066), an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015.[8]
Regulatory and litigation[edit]
Several wholesale lots of Impax's 200 mg fenofibrate capsules were recalled in March 2011.[9][10]
Impax and DAVA Pharmaceuticals engaged in a legal dispute with Purdue Pharma over the patents and production of time-released oxycodone (OxyContin) until reaching an agreement in April 2007.[11] Another dispute with Endo Pharmaceuticals and Penwest Pharmaceuticals concluded with Impax gaining the right to begin producing extended-release oxymorphone through its Global Pharmaceuticals division as of 2013.[12][13]
Impax announced the resolution of its FDA warning letter for its Hayward, CA facility on September 8, 2015.[14]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Nominating Committee of the Impax Board has initiated a search to identify a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer.
"Fred has been instrumental in Impax's ability to remove the warning letter regarding the Company's Hayward facility, which has allowed us to regain generic approvals from that facility," said Robert L. Burr, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Impax Laboratories. "Additionally, we appreciate his contributions in helping to get Rytary® approved and launched, and enhancing the Company's generic and brand portfolio with the acquisition of the Tower entities. On behalf of the Board, we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Mr. Burr added, "The Board of Directors remains confident in, and committed to, the Company's strategic direction. We are focused on finding a successor CEO that will lead Impax through its future growth. Until then, Kevin, who brings a great deal of pharmaceutical experience, along with a highly experienced executive management team, will lead the Company."
"I am extremely proud of the many accomplishments Impax has realized over the past several years," said Mr. Wilkinson. "I am truly grateful for the support I've received from the Board of Directors, the executive management team and most importantly, our highly dedicated employees. I am confident that Impax is well positioned for great success in the future."
Mr. Buchi said, "I look forward to working closely with the Impax Board and management team in this interim role. Together, we will ensure a smooth transition to Impax's next CEO and will remain focused on our corporate priorities and continue to execute on our core competencies in drug delivery, formulation technology and product development."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
The company’s predecessor entity, privately held Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was founded in 1995. Publicly traded Global Pharmaceutical Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a reverse merger, forming Impax Laboratories, Inc. on December 14, 1999.[2]
The merger combined the advanced drug delivery systems developed by Impax Pharmaceuticals through its research and development capabilities with Global Pharmaceutical’s sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In March 2015, Impax completed its acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. (including operating subsidiaries CorePharma LLC and Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC including its Adrenaclick epinephrine autoinjector), and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Impax reshaped the operating and reporting structure of its two divisions into Impax Generics and Impax Specialty Pharma.[1][4]
In June 2016, the company acquired 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which are close to market, for $586 million from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
Impax Generics includes the company’s legacy Global Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired CorePharma and Lineage Therapeutics businesses. Impax Specialty Pharma includes the legacy Impax Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired Amedra Pharmaceuticals business.[7]
Impax’s Generics Division focuses on a broad range of therapeutic areas, including products having technically challenging drug-delivery mechanisms or unique product formulations. In addition to developing solid oral dosage products, the company’s portfolio includes alternative dosage form products, primarily through alliance and collaboration agreements with third parties.[1]
The company’s Specialty Pharma Division is focused on the development and promotion, through the company’s specialty sales force, of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products for the treatment of Central Nervous System disorders and other select specialty segments.[1]
The Impax Specialty Pharma Division currently has one internally developed branded pharmaceutical product, RYTARY (IPX066), an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015.[8]
Regulatory and litigation[edit]
Several wholesale lots of Impax's 200 mg fenofibrate capsules were recalled in March 2011.[9][10]
Impax and DAVA Pharmaceuticals engaged in a legal dispute with Purdue Pharma over the patents and production of time-released oxycodone (OxyContin) until reaching an agreement in April 2007.[11] Another dispute with Endo Pharmaceuticals and Penwest Pharmaceuticals concluded with Impax gaining the right to begin producing extended-release oxymorphone through its Global Pharmaceuticals division as of 2013.[12][13]
Impax announced the resolution of its FDA warning letter for its Hayward, CA facility on September 8, 2015.[14]

History[edit]
The company’s predecessor entity, privately held Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was founded in 1995. Publicly traded Global Pharmaceutical Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a reverse merger, forming Impax Laboratories, Inc. on December 14, 1999.[2]
The merger combined the advanced drug delivery systems developed by Impax Pharmaceuticals through its research and development capabilities with Global Pharmaceutical’s sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.[3]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In March 2015, Impax completed its acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. (including operating subsidiaries CorePharma LLC and Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC including its Adrenaclick epinephrine autoinjector), and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Impax reshaped the operating and reporting structure of its two divisions into Impax Generics and Impax Specialty Pharma.[1][4]
In June 2016, the company acquired 15 marketed generics, as well as three others which are close to market, for $586 million from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
Impax Generics includes the company’s legacy Global Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired CorePharma and Lineage Therapeutics businesses. Impax Specialty Pharma includes the legacy Impax Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired Amedra Pharmaceuticals business.[7]
Impax’s Generics Division focuses on a broad range of therapeutic areas, including products having technically challenging drug-delivery mechanisms or unique product formulations. In addition to developing solid oral dosage products, the company’s portfolio includes alternative dosage form products, primarily through alliance and collaboration agreements with third parties.[1]
The company’s Specialty Pharma Division is focused on the development and promotion, through the company’s specialty sales force, of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products for the treatment of Central Nervous System disorders and other select specialty segments.[1]
The Impax Specialty Pharma Division currently has one internally developed branded pharmaceutical product, RYTARY (IPX066), an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015.[8]
Regulatory and litigation[edit]
Several wholesale lots of Impax's 200 mg fenofibrate capsules were recalled in March 2011.[9][10]
Impax and DAVA Pharmaceuticals engaged in a legal dispute with Purdue Pharma over the patents and production of time-released oxycodone (OxyContin) until reaching an agreement in April 2007.[11] Another dispute with Endo Pharmaceuticals and Penwest Pharmaceuticals concluded with Impax gaining the right to begin producing extended-release oxymorphone through its Global Pharmaceuticals division as of 2013.[12][13]
Impax announced the resolution of its FDA warning letter for its Hayward, CA facility on September 8, 2015.[14]
