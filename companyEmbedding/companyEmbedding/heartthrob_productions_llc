About Us




At Heartthrob Exhaust, we are committed to bringing our customers the finest in exhaust parts.  
We are a full exhaust warehouse, as well as a manufacturer, so we are able to meet most exhaust
needs.  We carry an extensive inventory, including gaskets, hangers, clamps, tubing, flex tubes,
exhaust kits, catalytic converters, air tubes, stainless steel and chrome tips, performance 
and stock mufflers, mandrel bends, glass packs and much more.  If it is automotive exhaust, 
either we have it, can get it, or can make it.
We currently have 6 CNC controlled mandrel tube benders with bending capabilities of 1.25 to 5 inch, 
with smaller sizes and additional bend radii coming soon.  Our facility also contains cutters, end 
forming machines, beading equipment, welders, mills, lathes, punch presses, laser tube coordinate 
measuring arm, a portable coordinate measuring machine (CCM), and much more.  We have the necessary 
equipment to make nearly any exhaust or tube product in our facility, and we can do custom products.



We specialize in CNC mandrel tube bending.  This is a must for any performance exhaust system.  On a 
normal muffler shop tube bender, the size of the tube is crushed and restricted.  On a tube that is 
mandrel bent, the tubing diameter is maintained, with no restrictions.  Combined with performance 
mufflers, this makes up the backbone of any performance exhaust system.  CNC mandrel tube bending 
ensures a precision finished part.
Our products are used on everything from late model cars to large diesel trucks, and even industrial machines.  
Along with our cataloged parts, we sell a very large 
number of non-cataloged special parts.  These are done per print or sample, with large, small, or 
even one-off production runs available.  We can do these either private label or branded, just call 
us for details.
You can find our Heartthrob brand products in many performance auto parts catalogs and websites.  We 
also supply a lot of exhaust parts for performance auto parts catalogs and websites under private label
 brands.  Call us and can refer you to an authorized distributor.
We are located in central Minnesota, about 70 miles west of the Minneapolis area.  We are a small,
 family owned company with an over 35 year history that prides itself in taking care of our customers.
 Back orders rarely happen, and we turn our orders quickly.  Most of our 30 employees have extensive 
 exhaust knowledge, and we are happy to answer any questions or give advice and ideas on your exhaust 
 projects.  Our 80,000 square foot facility includes a wide variety of inventory, production equipment,
 and even custom installation facilities.  If you are ever in our area, we invite you to stop in and 
 see us!

Heartthrob #4                    


Heartthrob #4










The heart wants what it wants and sometimes what it wants is to rob New York City of every thin dime. Callie and Mercer have landed in the big apple and, using Mercer's master list, begin a crime spree the city has never seen. But when their relationship hits a few bumps and the FBI closes in on them, can true love conquer all or will it make a plea deal?
