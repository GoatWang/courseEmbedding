 Definition
Michael Porter's cluster or competitive cluster is a geographical location where:

 enough resources and competences amass and reach a critical threshold,
 giving it a key position in a given economic branch of activity,
 with a decisive sustainable competitive advantage over others places, or even a world supremacy in that field.

Generally two types of competitive clusters, based on different kinds of knowledge, are recognized:

 Techno clusters - These clusters are high technology-oriented, well adapted to the knowledge economy, and typically have as a core renowned universities and research centers.
 Historic knowhow-based clusters - These are based on more traditional activities that maintain their advantage in know-how over the years, and for some of them, over the centuries. They are often industry specific.

The concept is named after Michael Porter, a Harvard professor who developed it. He claims that clusters have the potential to affect competition in three ways:

 by increasing the productivity of the companies in the cluster,
 by driving innovation in the field
 by stimulating new businesses in the field

The process of identifying, defining, and describing a cluster is not standardized. Individual economic consultants and researchers develop their own methodologies. All cluster analysis relies on evaluation of local and regional employment patterns, based on SIC codes.
An alternative to clusters, reflecting the distributed nature of business operations in the wake of globalization is Hubs and Nodes.

Examples
Well known examples are

 the Silicon valley, in California in the field of computer technology,
 Bangalore, in India, for software outsourcing,
 Paris, in France, for Haute couture,
 Toulouse, in France, for aerospace.
 Cambridge, in the UK, for biotechnology and electronic
 Belgian brewers

Michael E. Porter argued that a nation can create new advanced factor endowments such as skilled labor, a strong technology and knowledge base, government support, and culture. Porter used a diamond shaped diagram as the basis of a framework to illustrate the determinants of national advantage. This diamond represents the national playing field that countries establish for their industries.

 Porter's Diamond of National Advantage


The individual points on the diamond and the diamond as a whole affect four ingredients that lead to a national comparative advantage. These ingredients are:
1. the availability of resources and skills,
2. information that firms use to decide which opportunities to pursue with those resources and skills,
3. the goals of individuals in companies,
4. the pressure on companies to innovate and invest.

The points of the diamond are described as follows.


 Factor Conditions
 A country creates its own important factors such as skilled resources and technological base.
 The stock of factors at a given time is less important than the extent that they are upgraded and deployed.
 Local disadvantages in factors of production force innovation. Adverse conditions such as labor shortages or scarce raw materials force firms to develop new methods, and this innovation often leads to a national comparative advantage.

 Demand Conditions
 When the market for a particular product is larger locally than in foreign markets, the local firms devote more attention to that product than do foreign firms, leading to a competitive advantage when the local firms begin exporting the product.

 A more demanding local market leads to national advantage.

 A strong, trend-setting local market helps local firms anticipate global trends.



 Related and Supporting Industries
 When local supporting industries are competitive, firms enjoy more cost effective and innovative inputs.

 This effect is strengthened when the suppliers themselves are strong global competitors.



 Firm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry
 Local conditions affect firm strategy. For example, German companies tend to be hierarchical. Italian companies tend to be smaller and are run more like extended families. Such strategy and structure helps to determine in which types of industries a nation's firms will excel.

 In Porter's Five Forces model, low rivalry made an industry attractive. While at a single point in time a firm prefers less rivalry, over the long run more local rivalry is better since it puts pressure on firms to innovate and improve. In fact, high local rivalry results in less global rivalry.

 Local rivalry forces firms to move beyond basic advantages that the home country may enjoy, such as low factor costs.

 The Diamond as a System
 The effect of one point depends on the others. For example, factor disadvantages will not lead firms to innovate unless there is sufficient rivalry.

 The diamond also is a self-reinforcing system. For example, a high level of rivalry often leads to the formation of unique specialized factors. 



 Government's Role
The role of government in the model is to:

 Encourage companies to raise their performance, for example by enforcing strict product standards.

 Stimulate early demand for advanced products.

 Focus on specialized factor creation.

 Stimulate local rivalry by limiting direct cooperation and enforcing antitrust regulations.

Chance can play a role also

 Application to the Japanese Fax Machine Industry
The Japanese facsimile industry illustrates the diamond of national advantage. Japanese firms achieved dominance is this industry for the following reasons:

 Japanese factor conditions: Japan has a relatively high number of electrical engineers per capita.

 Japanese demand conditions: The Japanese market was very demanding because of the written language.

 Large number of related and supporting industries with good technology, for example, good miniaturized components since there is less space in Japan.

 Domestic rivalry in the Japanese fax machine industry pushed innovation and resulted in rapid cost reductions.

 Government support - NTT (the state-owned telecom company) changed its cumbersome approval requirements for each installation to a more general type approval.

Porter's Diamond of National Advantage



Porter's Diamond of National Advantage


Classical theories of international trade propose that comparative advantage resides in the factor endowments that a country may be
fortunate enough to inherit. Factor endowments include land, natural resources, labor, and the size of the local population.
Michael E. Porter argued that a nation can create new advanced factor endowments such as skilled labor, a strong technology and knowledge base, government support, and culture. Porter used a diamond shaped diagram as the basis of a framework to illustrate the determinants of national advantage. This diamond represents the national playing field that countries establish for their industries.

Recommended Reading

Porter, Michael E., The Competitive Advantage of Nations
In this 800+ page work, Michael Porter introduces his diamond of national advantage and its self-reinforcing nature. He then applies the diamond to examples in both manufacturing and service industries, and uses the value chain to  explain the growing role of services. The book concludes with implications on company strategy and national agendas.

description:

In the mid-1980s, Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School developed a framework to assess the competitiveness of regions, states and nations.In the early 1980s, U.S. industry saw its economic competitiveness eroded by Japanese and European competitors. Porter concluded that classical international trade theories, which mainly focused on slowly changing, “inherited” variables such as natural resources, climate, size of working population, etc., could only partially explain why nations gain competitive advantage in a given industry. This observation initiated a four year study of ten major trading nations and 100 industries that covered 50% of total world exports in 1985. Successful international industries tend to be located within particular cities and regions. Geographic concentration is vital for firms to efficiently draw on each others resources and capabilities and to benefit from a shared culture and learning experience, supply capabilities and local infrastructure. Industry clusters are geographical concentrations of interconnected businesses, suppliers, and associated institutions in a particular field. Clusters lead to productivity increases, higher innovation rates and faster new business developments. Porter argued that productivity is the main factor for international competitiveness and that the standard of living of a country’s population can be improved as a direct result of increases in that factor. Clusters may take different forms between firms producing different products across value-added chains or between firms producing similar products at different stages of the same chain. Examples are banking in London and New York, chemical transport in Rotterdam, Houston and Singapore, film in Mumbai and Hollywood and Internet/Software in Silicon Valley and Bangalore.Porter’s Diamond of competitive advantage model of nations consists of four main attributes that shape the national environment in which local, connected firms compete:1. FACTOR CONDITIONSThe nation’s relative position in vital industrial production factors such as skilled labour or infrastructure, are important determinants of national competiveness. Both the level of individual factors and the overall composition of the resource mix must be considered. Factors can be country specific or industry specific. For example, Japan’s large pool of engineers -- reflected by a much higher number of engineering graduates per capita than almost any other nation -- has been vital to Japan’s success in many manufacturing industries.2. DEMAND CONDITIONSThe nature of home demand for an industry’s products and services requires considering both the quantity and quality of the demand. For example, Japan’s sophisticated and knowledgeable buyers of cameras helped stimulate the Japanese camera industry to improve product quality and to launch new, innovative models.3. RELATED AND SUPPORTING INDUSTRIESThe presence or absence in the nation of internationally competitive supplier and related industries is a key factor. Until the mid-1980s for example, the technological leadership in the U.S. semiconductor industry provided the basis for U.S. success in personal computers and several other technically advanced electronic products. Adoption of the automobile took off in the USA after the construction of a national system of highways and gas stations. 4. FIRM STRATEGY, STRUCTURE, AND RIVALRYThe national conditions that determine how companies are created, organised and managed, as well as the nature and extent of domestic rivalry. For example, the predominance of engineers on the top-management teams of German and Japanese firms results in emphasising the improvement of the manufacturing processes and product design. Furthermore, domestic rivalry creates pressure to launch new products, to improve quality, to reduce costs and to invest in new, more advanced technologies.Porter stated two additional variables that indirectly influence the diamond:5. CHANCE EVENTSDisruptive developments outside the control of firms and governments that allow in  new players who exploit opportunities arising from a reshaped industry structure. For example, radical innovations, unexpected oil prise rises, revolutions, wars, etc.6.    GOVERNMENTGovernment choice of policies can influence each of the four determinants. Successful government policies work in those industries where underlying determinants of national advantage are present and reinforced by government actions. Government can raise the odds of gaining competitive advantage but lacks the power to create advantages on its own.These six attributes promote or impede the creation of competitive advantages of firms, clusters, and nations. All conditions need to be present and favourable for an industry/company within a country to attain global supremacy. Managers can use the diamond model during their internationalisation efforts to determine if the home market can support and sustain a successful internationalisation effort or to asses in which country to invest next. The model helps entrepreneurs decide where to start their next venture. Government officials can use the model for guidance on how to best build a supporting policy framework for a given industry.

pros:

Porters Diamond model explains why corporations domiciled in certain countries are successful in penetrating foreign markets. This model can be used to assess competitive advantage of the national environment in which individual business units, organisations, or industries operate. 
 


The model helps to understand the dynamic interplay between a firms corporate strategy and the competitive advantages of a country  the habitat in which organisations operate. This model is an addition to Porters five forces model dealing with industry structure. The diamond model emphasises that a firm should only internationalise when it has a strong position in its home market.
 


The model provides an explanation of why industry clusters are relevant
 


Governments can play an active role in supporting the development of clusters countering  the notion of public laissez-fair
 


The model shows that apart from inter-firm rivalry, cooperation is a vital component of corporate strategy. Companies should form strategic alliances, especially with organisations in related and supporting industries.
 


The model explains in part the resource curse -- why a large natural resources base is not sufficient to develop industrial might.
 



cons:

The situation in which all four attributes are correctly lined up to boost the development of a given industry provides only a higher probability that an industry will develop. Its development depends on personal action for the favourable conditions to be fully commercially exploited.  
 


The absence of any of the four conditions from the diamond domestically, may not inhibit companies and industries from becoming globally competitive. For example if related and supporting industries are not available locally, materials and components can be easily brought in from abroad because of advancements in transportation and the relaxation of import restrictions.
 


Capacity gets created by better allocation of resources due to the pressure of competition. The model pays no direct attention to competence building.
 


The level of importance of chance as a nucleus for change is not clear. How much change is needed to make the transition to a globally competitive economic cluster?
 


Cooperation directly between rivals is considered non advantageous due to the reason that it decreases the strength of rivalry. This view does not always hold, e.g. when - based on cooperation - industry standards get developed that grow the overall market.
 


The importance of exchange rates and wage rates in the determination of competitiveness is overlooked. No comparative data for wages, price levels or cost levels in manufacturing were listed in the country fact files in Porters 1990 volume.
 


The impact of virtual clusters where participants located across countries collaborate via Internet on Porters model has not been determined
 


The model assumes that national free markets exist where firms compete head-to-head.  This is not the case in many countries on this globe.
 


Porter placed perhaps a too great an emphasis on the role of home based companies when the driving force is the multinational company
 


Moon, Rugman & Verbeke argued that the Porter Diamond Framework is useful in a single country context but, as so much of a nations activity takes place in a regional, international or global context, it is important to consider the trade relationships between countries to gain a full understanding at the nation level. A Double Diamond Framework was proposed to consider the trade space between two countries.
