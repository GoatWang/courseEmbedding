Research

	Intensive in-house fundamental research is the centerpiece of Cardinal’s investment process. The four portfolio managers and four research analysts each perform detailed company research. Each existing or prospective holding is covered by a primary analyst but investment decisions are made by consensus among the portfolio managers.

	Investment ideas come from diverse areas, with the largest source being generated internally. All four portfolio managers have backgrounds that are rooted in free cash flow, the cornerstone of Cardinal’s investment philosophy. Since the inception of our value strategy we have created over 600 financial models on companies we have owned (of which over 175 models are actively updated), and we continue to build about 35 new models each year. This repository serves as a significant source of potential investments.

	We gather information to aid us in determining if a business is stable and predictable and generates substantial free cash flow. Further, we seek information to assess management’s motivations and their track record in redeploying the company’s capital. In researching these issues, we spend considerable time with company management on the phone and in person after reading the publicly available financial information on file with the SEC as well as reviewing transcripts of previous industry presentations and conference calls. As a result of our preparation and the credibility we have built with many management teams over the years, we are able to have much more insightful discussions with them about the longer-term value drivers of the business

Journey Home Breaks Ground in Cañon City, Colorado



Pamela Lyons


July 26, 2017





















On Thursday, July 20th, 2017, Cardinal Capital joined local, state, federal officials, investment and development partners to celebrate the groundbreaking of Journey Home, a 30-unit permanent supportive housing project in Cañon City, Colorado.Combining housing with access to support services, the 3-story structure under construction at 250 Justice Center Road will connect formerly homeless adults and families with case management, mental health treatment and vocational training.Journey Home is the result of a unique partnership between Loaves & Fishes Ministries of Fremont County and Cardinal Capital. Part of a statewide effort to strengthen the continuum of services available to Colorado's vulnerable homeless population, Journey Home's housing-first approach helps those in crisis address employment, health concerns, substance use, and other issues that may have been neglected in the day-to-day struggle to survive on the streets.Financed with equity raised from Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits awarded by Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, and 30 Project-based Housing Choice Vouchers provided by Colorado Department of Local Affairs' Division of Housing and administered by the Upper Arkansas Area Council of Governments, occupancy of all 30 units will be restricted to households with annual incomes of less than 50% of area median income. However, the income of the typical resident will be below the poverty line.The development and construction of Journey Home is lead by Cardinal Capital and the project is expected to be complete in June 2018.Read more about this project in the Canon City Daily Record

Our Services


	 

	Achieving financial success is a complex and confusing challenge to even the most experienced investors, requiring a significant amount of time, knowledge, and resources. That is why many institutions and affluent individual investors demand a different investment approach, one that elevates their portfolio beyond one-dimensional strategies while leveraging the expertise of highly skilled professional investment managers.

	Our firm offers just this kind of approach. We offer an asset management service that is designed to protect and increase your wealth by delivering the potential for superior after-tax returns with an unprecedented level of personalized service and expertise.

	What distinguishes our firm is its personal approach. It is built around you—your goals, your time frame, and your tolerance for risk. As your needs change, our ongoing management process ensures your personal portfolio will evolve with you. It is not a get-rich-quick strategy or a “hot-tip” investment product. Instead, it employs a disciplined process that sophisticated institutional investors have followed for decades in managing their investments. And, it employs a diverse range of asset classes, investment styles, and nationally prominent investment managers to meet your specific objectives.

	The result is a well-tuned, asset management process designed to respond to your individual needs while also responding to the dynamics of the capital markets. Your portfolio strategy begins with a personal and in-depth analysis of your current situation. Every investor has different needs and objectives. We will help you determine whether you need investments that produce income, growth, or a combination of both. Furthermore, we will help you define your investment time horizon and risk profile. We then determine an appropriate asset allocation policy and diversify your investment portfolio across multiple asset classes, within multiple investment styles, and by using multiple money managers. We monitor your portfolio regularly and rebalance asset allocations as needed.

	In addition, we also offer Financial Planning services. Whether you’re concerned about your retirement assets or are just planning for a child’s college education, we look at all your assets—including those not managed by Cardinal Capital Management—and will prepare an objective outlook and plan to help make your goals happen.

	Finally, we believe we provide one of the most comprehensive and easy-to-understand reporting packages available. Monthly-consolidated statements, quarterly account-level performance reporting, and quarterly personal meetings are all included. More importantly, our goal is to provide you with the highest level of personalized service at any time, whether it’s reviewing the status of your account or consulting with us on any matter of concern to you.

	Talk to us about improving your investment portfolio. We look forward to serving your needs in a highly confidential manner and helping you succeed in this world of investment opportunity.
