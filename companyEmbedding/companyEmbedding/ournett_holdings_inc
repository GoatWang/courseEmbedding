There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold in this offering. As a
result, we will retain the proceeds from any funds raised and the proceeds will
not be returned to the investor. In the event that we only raise a minimum
amount under this offering, we will immediately utilize the proceeds. As a
result, if you are an initial investor and we fail to raise additional proceeds,
your investment will be rendered worthless. If we raise $15,000 in this
offering, we expect that we will continue in operations until May 2014. If we
are able to raise the full $30,000 in this offering, we expect that we will be
able to continue in operations until September 2014. If we raise less than
$15,000, we may not be able to continue in operations through May 2014. For
example, if we only sell $1,500 (5% of the offering) or $7,500 (25% of the
offering) in securities, we will utilize the proceeds in our operations but we
will not be able to implement our business plan to any meaningful extent
rendering your investment worthless. If the maximum number of shares of common
stock is sold, we estimate that we will receive proceeds of $30,000 from our
sale of the 1,200,000 shares of common stock offered by us. This estimate is
based on an initial public offering price of $0.025 per share. Subscription
funds will not be placed into escrow, trust or any other similar arrangement.
There are no investor protections for the return of subscription funds once
accepted. Once we receive the purchase price for the shares, we will be able to
use the funds.

We expect to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital purposes
including payment of consultants for software development and website design and
development.
               
Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend
on numerous factors, including the successful commercialization of our website,
competing technological and market developments, and the development of
strategic alliances for the development and marketing of our website. We intend
to try to obtain funds through equity or debt financing, strategic alliances
with corporate partners and others, or through other sources.

On September 19, 2013, four shareholders loaned our company $61,992 in
consideration of a promissory note with a ten year term due and payable in
September 2023 with interest that accrues at 1% per annum. In addition, during
the quarter ended September 30, 2013, the shareholders purchased an aggregate of
7,605,000 shares of common stock at a per share purchase price of $0.014 for
aggregate consideration of $106,470.

In the event Ournett’s plans change or its assumptions change or prove to be
inaccurate or the funds available prove to be insufficient to fund operations at
the planned level (due to further unanticipated expenses, delays, problems or
otherwise), We could be required to obtain additional funds earlier than
expected. We do not have any committed sources of additional financing, and
there can be no assurance that additional funding, if necessary, will be
available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available,
we may be required to further delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain aspects of
our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with
collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to
certain of our technologies, product candidates, products or potential
markets. If adequate funds are not available, our business, financial condition
and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.

Until required for operations, our policy is to invest our cash reserves in bank
deposits. We expect that its operating results will fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter in the future and will depend on a number of factors, most of
which are outside our control.


In recent years, a substantial number of competing group buying sites have
emerged around the world. Our major domestic competitors will include Woot,
Groupon, Google, Microsoft, Eversave, Buy With Me and Living Social. These
competitors offer substantially the same or similar product offerings that we
intend to, although none of our comptetitors employ anything similar to the
shareholder-blogger component of our company’s structure and business model. We
will also compete with businesses that focus on particular merchant categories
or markets. We will also compete with traditional offline discount services, as
well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide
discounts on products and services. We believe the principal competitive factors
in our target market include the following:

. breadth of subscriber base and merchants featured;  

. local presence and understanding of local business trends;  

. ability to deliver a high volume of relevant deals to consumers;  

. ability to produce high purchase rates for deals among subscribers;  

. ability to generate positive return on investment for merchants; and  

. strength and recognition of our brand.  

Although we believe we may compete favorably on the factors described above, we
anticipate that larger, more established companies may directly compete with
us. Many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories,
significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and
larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to
benefit from their existing customer or subscriber base with lower acquisition
costs or to respond more quickly than we may be able to to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements. These competitors may engage
in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching
marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow
them to build a larger subscriber base or to monetize that subscriber base more
effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are
similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance
than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that
merchant payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our intended
market, they may become such a factor and we may be unable to compete fairly on
such terms.


Company Description
We are a development stage company. Ournett Holdings, Inc. (“Ournett”) is in the
process of developing an e-commerce marketplace that connects merchants to
consumers by offering primarily goods at a discount. Traditionally, merchants
have tried to reach consumers and generate sales through a


 variety of methods,
including the yellow pages, direct mail, newspaper, radio, television and online
advertisements, and promotions. Our company, through our website,
www.ournett.com, will create a new portal for local merchants to attract
customers and sell primarily goods. Our goal is to provide consumers with
savings and help them discover new product offerings at a discounted price.

Our principal executive office is located at 500 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1420, New
York, New York 10110, and our telephone number is 212-986- 1544. We were
formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 26, 2013. Our website is 
located at www.ournett.com.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
