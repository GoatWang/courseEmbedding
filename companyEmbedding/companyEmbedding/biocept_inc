About Biocept
At Biocept, we are dedicated to one thing: improving outcomes for cancer patients. That’s why we focus on developing innovative diagnostic solutions that give patients and doctors the information they need—all from a simple blood test, known as a liquid biopsy.
Our scientific experts have spent years working to change the way physicians look at blood in cancer patients. We have developed a unique, patented methodology to isolate cancer material that is shed into the bloodstream, such as circulating tumor cells, (CTCs) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Using our testing service to analyze and interrogate CTCs and ctDNA for certain biomarkers, physicians can be better informed about the actionable molecular information associated with a patient’s cancer. Because we use a simple blood sample, this molecular information can be obtained non-invasively and more rapidly than a tissue biopsy. Additionally, our liquid biopsy tests offer a solution when a tissue biopsy is insufficient or not possible. Using our proprietary liquid biopsy testing service, physicians can obtain information they need to develop a personalized cancer treatment plan for their patients—all from a simple blood test. 
Biocept’s services are available to medical and surgical oncologists, pathologists, hospitals, cancer centers, universities, and pharmaceutical and clinical researchers. Our liquid biopsies have been used by doctors in thousands of patient cases. We partner with industry leaders and major cancer centers, continually advancing the field of cancer diagnostics.
Success Stories
Doctors are already using Biocept to establish biomarker status for thousands of patients.

 WHAT  WHEN HOW
 A new option for learning about your patients’ cancer.
When cancer metastasizes or spreads, it sheds tumor cells and cancer-causing DNA fragments into the blood.
Biocept has developed the most advanced method for detecting and assessing tumor cells and cancer-causing DNA fragments in the blood. 
You get the same information you would get from a tissue sample—from a simple blood test.
And because Biocept uses blood, you are informed about what’s happening with your patients’ cancer NOW—not weeks, months, or years ago. 
When should you consider a liquid biopsy?
Liquid biopsies give you a valuable new tool to establish biomarker status when…





 





 

Not enough
tissue was obtained 
from an initial biopsy. 

If an initial tissue biopsy isn't sufficient to establish
biomarker status, a liquid biopsy lets you avoid
repeat surgical biopsies. 







 

Cancer starts in a place 
that’s difficult to access 
for surgical biopsy. 

If biopsy is unfeasible or risky, a liquid biopsy gives 
you the information you need, with a simple, 
noninvasive test. 







 

Cancer metastasizes 
to the brain, bone, 
lung, or other 
difficult-to-biopsy 
location. 

When cancer spreads to a place you can’t reach, a
biopsy at the site of origin may not tell you what you 
need to know. A liquid biopsy gives you a more 
complete understanding of metastatic cancer.
 







 

Cancer recurs after 
the initial tumor tissue 
has been removed.   

You can’t biopsy what isn’t there. When cancer comes 
back after treatment, a liquid biopsy lets you 
re-establish biomarker status and see whether 
clinically significant changes have taken place.
 







 

The patient isn’t 
responding to 
treatment the way 
you expect.  

If you know the biomarkers, but your patient isn’t 
responding the way you expect, a liquid biopsy can
help you find out if you’re up against tumor
heterogeneity, discordance, convergence, or 
acquired resistance.
 







 

The patient
doesn't want
a repeat biopsy. 

Your patients have been through a lot. A liquid
biopsy is easier, faster, and less invasive than surgical
biopsy—an attractive option that lets you get the
information you need for appropriate treatment.  



 



How does it work?
A liquid biopsy from Biocept is a fast, easy way to establish biomarker status.

Order a blood test.
Your patient can get their blood drawn the same day, at any lab.

The sample is sent via Fed-Ex to the Biocept lab.
Our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited lab isolates cancer cells and DNA fragments and uses analytically and clinically validated tests to look for standard, clinically relevant biomarkers.

You get results within 7 days.
The Biocept report gives you critical information when options are limited and fast with no surgery.

Who pays for a liquid biopsy?
Biocept accepts all insurance and will bill on behalf of the patient. In addition, Biocept has a Financial Assistance Program (see Billing Policy), with payment plans available based on the patient’s financial situation. We are committed to excellence and are here to assist with any questions or concerns you may have.
Please call 888.332.7729 M-F from 8-5 PST to discuss individual claims and policies.
