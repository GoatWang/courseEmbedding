1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

MERRILL LYNCH LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
MERRILL LYNCH LIFE VARIABLE ANNUITY 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT D
SUPPLEMENT DATED JANUARY 8, 2007
TO THE
PROSPECTUS FOR
 MERRILL LYNCH INVESTOR CHOICE ANNUITY(SM)
(IRA SERIES)
(DATED MAY 1, 2006) 

Effective January 12, 2007, this supplement updates your Prospectus for the     
Merrill Lynch Investor Choice Annuity(SM) (IRA Series) (the "Contract") issued  
through Merrill Lynch Life Variable Annuity Separate Account D.   This          
supplement describes changes to the existing Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal      
Benefit known as the "GMWB" discussed in your Prospectus.   In addition, this   
supplement describes a new modified Return of Premium Guaranteed Minimum Death  
Benefit ("GMDB") that is available for an additional charge only to contract    
owners who elect a GMWB.  You should read this supplement in its entirety and   
keep it together with your Prospectus for future reference.                     

GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT 

You may now purchase the GMWB on a single life ("Single Life") basis or on a    
joint life basis ("Joint Life"),  For an additional charge, the new Single Life 
and Joint Life riders are available to new purchasers at contract issue only,   
subject to state availability. The new riders provide additional feature        
enhancements, such as a "Greater of Roll-Up and MAV" calculation of the GMWB    
Base prior to the first withdrawal, and Automatic Step-Ups of the GMWB Base to  
equal the contract value, if higher, for the life of the rider, plus automatic  
resets of the Lifetime Income Percentage if an Automatic Step-Up occurs. Each   
rider will terminate whenever the base contract terminates.                     

Under the Joint Life rider, lifetime withdrawals are guaranteed for your life   
and the life of the joint annuitant. Under the Single Life rider, lifetime      
withdrawals are guaranteed only for your life. Also, please note that adding a  
new joint annuitant under the Joint Life rider resets the GMWB Base to the      
current account value, if lower. Throughout the Prospectus, the new Single Life 
and Joint Life benefits will be collectively referred to as "GMWB."  Differences
between the Single Life and the Joint Life riders are set forth in the following
chart.  The most significant difference between the Single Life rider and the   
Joint Life rider is that under the Single Life rider, joint annuitants are not  
permitted; whereas under the Joint Life rider, joint annuitants are permitted,  
but they must be spouses.

Please replace the "GMWB" line in the table captioned "Periodic Charges Other   
Than Fund Expenses-Annual Charge for Optional Riders" on page 4 of the          
Prospectus with the first two lines of the following table and add the third    
line of the following table:                                                    

                                                                [Download Table]

(7)  The GMWB Base is the amount used to calculate the Guaranteed Lifetime      
Amount under the GMWB.  The Guaranteed Lifetime Amount is equal to the GMWB Base
multiplied by the Lifetime Income Percentage.  For more information, see        
"Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit."                                        

(11)  The GMDB Base is generally the minimum value that would be paid under this
GMDB.  The Return of Premium GMDB (GMWB version) is available only if you elect 
a GMWB option.  For more information, see "Death Benefit."                      

In the "Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit" section of the Prospectus on page
60, the following should replace the first sentence of the first paragraph:     

"If you are concerned that poor subaccount investment performance may adversely 
impact the amount of money you can withdraw from your Contract, we offer two    
optional Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit ("GMWB") riders each for an      
additional charge. The optional GMWB riders are the Single Life and Joint Life  
riders.  These riders are collectively referred to as "GMWB" or "GMWB rider."   

In the "Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit" section of the Prospectus under  
the heading "General" on page 60, the following should follow the second bullet:

"All optional guaranteed benefit riders under the contract terminate when       
annuity payments begin on or before the Maturity Date."                         

In the "How Do I Elect the GMWB Rider?" section of the Prospectus on page 61,   
the following should be added after the third sentence of the second paragraph: 

"Changing an annuitant or joint annuitant may have tax consequences."           

In the "What is the Guaranteed Lifetime Amount?" section, on page 62 please     
delete the paragraph immediately before the Example, in its entirety and replace
it with the following:                                                          

"If you elected the Single Life rider, annuitant changes are not permitted      
except upon spousal continuation. (See "Spousal Continuation" below.)           

If you elected the Joint Life rider and later add a new joint annuitant, the    
GMWB Base is reset to the current account value, if lower, except upon spousal  
continuation (See "Spousal Continuation" below).  The Lifetime Income Percentage
may change based on the younger spouse's age or on the surviving spouse's age on
the spousal continuation date.  If a joint annuitant spouse is removed then the 
GMWB Base remains unchanged; however, if withdrawals were taken, the Lifetime   
Income Percentage may change based on the remaining annuitant's age on the date 
of the first withdrawal or the most recent Automatic Step-Up, if later. Any     
change in the GMWB Base or the Lifetime Income Percentage will also change the  
Guaranteed Lifetime Amount."

In the "When and How is the GMWB Base Calculated?-(2) Prior to the First        
Withdrawal" section on page 64 of the Prospectus, please add the following to   
the end of the section:                                                         

"The GMWB Roll-Up Base is equal to:                                             

 -  the GMWB Base on the GMWB Effective Date, plus any additional premiums
    paid prior to the first Quarterversary, with interest compounded daily
from the GMWB Effective Date at an annual rate of 5%, plus        

  -  additional premiums paid on or after the first Quarterversary following
       the GMWB Effective Date with interest compounded daily from the effective
date of each additional premium payment at an annual rate of 5%.  

The period during which interest will accrue for purposes of calculating the    
GMWB Roll-Up Base is limited.  Interest accrues until the earlier of:

AUTOMATIC ROLL-UP RESET.      On each of the first five contract anniversaries  
after the GMWB Effective Date, the GMWB Roll-Up Base will automatically reset to
the contract value, if greater. Interest will continue to accrue for five years 
after each automatic roll-up reset, if any."                                    

In the "When and How is the GMWB Base Calculated?-Automatic Step-Up" section on 
page 64 of the Prospectus, please replace the phrase "on each third contract    
anniversary" with the following:"                                               

"on each contract anniversary."                                                 

In the "May I Cancel the GMWB Rider?" section of the Prospectus on page 65,     
please replace the first sentence with the following:                           

"You may cancel the GMWB rider on each fifth contract anniversary after the     
contract date."                                                                 

Please add a section on page 65 entitled "Change of Annuitant" that states the  
following:                                                                      

"Under the Single Life rider, changes of annuitant are not permitted except upon
spousal continuation.   The new annuitant must be at least 60 years old on the  
spousal continuation date. The maximum age limit is waived for the surviving    
spouse upon spousal continuation. Under the Joint Life rider, adding a new joint
annuitant resets the GMWB Base to the current account value, if lower.  The new 
joint annuitant must be at least 60 and not more than 80 years old when added,  
except upon spousal continuation where the maximum age limit is waived for the  
surviving spouse.   Removing a joint annuitant does not affect the GMWB Base."

Under the Single Life rider, an eligible spousal beneficiary can continue the   
contract and the GMWB under the Spousal Beneficiary Continuation Option only if 
all of the following conditions are met: (i) the GMWB rider is still available  
for purchase; (ii) the surviving spouse was named as the primary beneficiary    
under the contract; and (iii) the surviving spouse is at least 60 years old on  
the spousal continuation date.  If (i), (ii) and (iii) are satisfied, then the

(i) If both spouses are joint annuitants under the Joint Life rider; and (ii)   
each spouse has designated his or her "surviving spouse" as the primary         
beneficiary under the Contract, then the following changes will occur:

*IMPORTANT NOTE: If the contract owner is a non-natural owner and a non-grantor 
trust, spousal continuation generally is not available, and the GMWB may not be 
appropriate.  In addition, spousal continuation may not satisfy RMD rules for   
tax sheltered annuities. Please consult your tax advisor. "                     

GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT--RETURN OF PREMIUM (GMWB VERSION)              

As discussed in your Prospectus, the Contract provides you with GMDB options.   
For an additional charge, you may elect one of the GMDB options available under 
the Contract.  Once you elect a GMDB option, you cannot change or cancel it. If 
you purchase a GMDB, under the B Class, L Class, or C Class contracts, the death
benefit equals the greater of the account value less uncollected charges or the 
GMDB Base. However, if you purchase a GMDB under the XC Class Contract, the     
death benefit equals the greater of the account value, less uncollected charges 
and any bonus amounts subject to recapture on the death of the owner or the GMDB
Base.                                                                           

We are now offering a new GMDB option, the Return of Premium GMDB (GMWB         
Version), which you may elect if you (or the annuitant, if the owner is a       
non-natural person) are age 80 or under on the contract date.  The Return of    
Premium GMDB (GMWB version) is available for an additional charge ONLY IF YOU   
ELECT A GMWB RIDER.  As discussed in your Prospectus, a GMWB rider is an        
optional rider that allows you to take minimum annual payments regardless of    
your account value during your lifetime. The Return of Premium GMDB (GMWB       
version) must be elected with a GMWB rider on the contract date and will        
terminate if you cancel the GMWB rider or the GMWB rider reaches settlement.    

GMDB BASE - RETURN OF PREMIUM (GMWB VERSION).  If you purchase the Return of    
Premium GMDB (GMWB Version), the GMDB Base is reduced dollar-for-dollar for     
withdrawals in any contract year up to the current Guaranteed Lifetime Amount.  
As stated in your Prospectus, the Guaranteed Lifetime Amount is determined by   
multiplying the GMWB Base by the Lifetime Income Percentage based on the        
annuitant's age at the time of the first withdrawal on or after the date the    
GMWB rider becomes effective.  If a withdrawal causes total withdrawals for that
contract year to exceed the Guaranteed Lifetime Amount, the GMDB Base equals the
lesser of the account value after the excess withdrawal or the GMDB Base reduced
by the withdrawal amount.  The GMDB Base is not permitted to exceed the GMWB    
Base; therefore, if the resulting GMDB Base is higher than your GMWB Base, we   
will reset your GMDB Base to equal your GMWB Base.  (See "GMWB Base" in the     
Prospectus for a discussion on how the GMWB Base is calculated).

If a permissible annuitant change is made (other than as a result of spousal    
continuation or ownership is transferred from an individual to a trust/entity   
with the same tax identification and vice versa), then the GMDB Base will be    
reset to equal the current contract value, if lower.                            

Please note that the Return of Premium GMDB (GMWB version) differs from the     
standard Return of Premium GMDB in the following ways:                          

-  The GMDB Base is reduced dollar-for-dollar for withdrawals in any  
   contract year up to the current Guaranteed Lifetime Amount, whereas
    all withdrawals under the standard Return of Premium GMDB reduce the
GMDB Base proportionately.                                      

-  If a withdrawal causes total withdrawals for that contract year to 
      exceed the Guaranteed Lifetime Amount, the GMDB Base equals the lesser
 of the account value after the excess withdrawal or the GMDB Base
reduced by the withdrawal amount.                               

-  The GMDB Base is not permitted to exceed the GMWB Base;            
       therefore, if the resulting GMDB Base is higher than your GMWB Base, we
will reset your GMDB Base to equal your GMWB Base.

10. Each Subaccount invests only in shares of a designated portfolio of certain management investment companies (the “Funds”). The Companies may also make fixed account options available under the Contracts in the future. 
11. The Contracts are individual flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts issued by the Companies through the Separate Accounts. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a variable basis during the accumulation period, and provide for a variety of annuity settlement options. Certain Contracts may be purchased on a non-qualified tax basis. Certain Contracts also may be purchased and used in connection with Start Printed Page 77784plans qualifying for favorable federal income tax treatment. The Contracts currently offer four different charge structures, each referred to as a “Class.” Each Class, including an XC Class described in more detail below, imposes different surrender charges and asset-based insurance charges. 
12. The Owner determines at the time of application for a Contract how premium payments will be allocated among the Subaccounts of the applicable Separate Account. The Owner generally may allocate premium payments to up to 20 of any of the available Subaccounts. The Contract Value, which is the total value of an Owner's interest in the Contract, will vary with the investment performance of the Subaccounts selected, and the Owner bears the entire risk for amounts allocated to the Subaccounts. 
13. During the Free Look Period, an Owner has the right to return his or her Contract within ten days (or longer if required by state law). If the Contract is returned during the Free Look Period, the amount refunded will equal the Contract Value as of the date MLLIC or MLNY receives the returned Contract. However, in those states that require a return of premium payments in the event of Contract cancellation, the Companies will instead return the greater of all premium payments paid into the Contract (less any withdrawals) or the Contract Value as of the date MLLIC or MLNY receives the returned Contract. 
In states that require a return of premium payments, the Companies will allocate all premium payments to a money market Subaccount during the first fourteen days following the Contract Date. In those states, the Companies bear any investment risk associated with the premium payments during the Free Look Period; otherwise, the Owner will bear any investment risk associated with the premium payments during the Free Look Period. 
The Companies will not assess surrender charges against a Contract returned during the Free Look Period. The Companies will generally pay the refund within seven days after they receive the returned Contract. The Contract will then be considered void. As described in more detail below, the Companies intend to recapture bonus amounts added to the Contract Value if the Owner returns the Contract during the Free Look Period.
14. The Owner may surrender the Contract or make a partial withdrawal from Contract Value during the accumulation period. The minimum amount that may be withdrawn is $100, and at least $5,000 must remain in the Contract after a partial withdrawal (and any associated surrender charge) is made. If an Owner surrenders a Contract or takes a partial withdrawal, the Companies may deduct a surrender charge to compensate them for expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts, such as commissions, preparation of sales literature, and other promotional activity. Upon partial withdrawal, the Companies also may deduct any applicable premium taxes. Upon surrender, the Companies also will deduct any applicable contract fee, accrued but uncollected rider charges, and premium taxes. The surrender charge will be reduced using the “free withdrawal amount” provided for in the Contract. The free withdrawal amount is the portion of any partial withdrawal or surrender that is not subject to a surrender charge. The free withdrawal amount is the greater of: (a) 10% of the amount of each premium subject to a surrender charge (not to exceed the amount of each premium that had not been previously withdrawn as of the beginning of the Contract year), less any prior withdrawals during that Contract year; and (b) the “gain” in the Contract plus premiums remaining in the Contract that are no longer subject to a surrender charge. Any amount previously withdrawn from the Contract during that Contract year will be taken into account in determining the “free withdrawal amount” available as of the date of the withdrawal request. For the purpose of calculating the surrender charge, the Companies make withdrawals as if gain is withdrawn first, followed by premiums. Premium payments are assumed to be withdrawn on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. 
The surrender charge equals a percentage of each premium withdrawn. With regard to the XC Class offered under the Contracts, each premium is subject to the charge for the applicable period specified below from the date it is received and accepted by MLLIC or MLNY, as follows: 
Complete years elapsed since payment of premiumSurrender charge percentage (as a percentage of the premium payment)08.018.027.037.046.056.065.074.083.090
As described in more detail below, the Companies may recapture all or a portion of the bonus amounts added to the Contract Value if the Owner surrenders the Contract or makes a partial withdrawal within three years of MLLIC's or MLNY's receipt and acceptance of a premium payment. 
15. Under certain circumstances, the Contract may be terminated due to inactivity. If no premiums have been received during the prior 24 months, the total of all premiums paid (less any partial withdrawals) is less than $2,000, and the Contract Value is less than $2,000, then the Contract may be terminated. No Contract will be terminated solely due to negative investment performance. Termination for inactivity is treated as a surrender for purposes of bonus recapture. 
16. During the accumulation period, the Companies will pay a death benefit upon the Owner's death (upon the death of the first Owner to die if there are Co-Owners, or upon the death of the first Annuitant if any Owner is not a natural person). Unless the Owner selects an optional guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), the death benefit will equal the Contract Value. 
17. The Contracts provide four GMDB options that an Owner may select to purchase for an additional charge if the Owner (or the older Owner, if the Contract has Co-Owners, or the Annuitant, if the Owner is a non-natural person) is age 75 or under. If the Owner dies within 90 days of the Contract Date or within one year of the date of a change of Owner, any GMDB will equal the Contract Value. Some GMDB options may not be available in every state. If the Owner purchases a GMDB, the death benefit equals the greater of the Contract Value or the GMDB Base. The current calculation for each GMDB Base is described below. 
18. In addition to the above death benefits and for an additional charge, an Owner may elect the Additional Death Benefit Rider if the Owner (or the older Owner, if the Contract has Co-Owners, or the older Annuitant, if the Owner is a non-natural person) is age 75 or under. This rider is designed to help offset expenses, including income taxes, attributable to payment of death benefit proceeds. The Additional Death Benefit Rider may not be available in all states. Upon payment of the death benefit, the Companies may deduct any applicable premium taxes. 
19. As described in more detail below, the Companies will recapture any bonus amounts added to the Contract Value if the Owner (the first Owner to die, if there are Co-Owners, or the first Annuitant, if any Owner is not a natural Start Printed Page 77785person) dies within six months of MLLIC's or MLNY's receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment. However, if an Owner dies and the Contract is continued under the spousal benefit continuation option, any bonus amounts not previously recaptured will no longer be subject to recapture as of the spousal continuation date. 
20. If an Owner elects the XC Class under the Contracts, then the Companies will add a bonus amount to the Contract Value each time the Owner makes a premium payment. With regard to an initial premium payment, the Companies will apply the corresponding bonus amount to an Owner's Contract Value on the Contract Date. With regard to each additional premium payment, the Companies will apply a corresponding bonus amount to an Owner's Contract Value at the end of the valuation period during which that premium payment is received and accepted at MLLIC's or MLNY's Service Center. 
21. To calculate each bonus amount, the Companies will allocate the corresponding premium payment to one or more bonus tiers based on the amount of cumulative premium payments made under the Contract, as follows:
If cumulative premium payments are:Then maximum bonus amount percentage is:Then current bonus percentage is:Then minimum guaranteed bonus percentage is:Less than or equal to $25,0005.04.53.0Greater than $25,000 but less than or equal to $125,0005.54.53.0Greater than $125,000 but less than or equal to $500,0005.54.53.5Greater than $500,000 but less than or equal to $1,000,0006.05.54.0Greater than $1,000,0007.05.54.5
Thus, the Companies may apply different bonus percentages to each premium payment (unless cumulative premium payments are less than or equal to $25,000) by breaking out the payment according to the ranges in the above table and multiplying the portion of the payment allocated to each tier by that tier's current bonus amount percentage. However, a premium payment will only be allocated to the first tier if cumulative premium payments are less than or equal to $25,000. If the initial premium payment exceeds $25,000, the first tier will not apply and the second tier will apply to all cumulative premiums less than or equal to $125,000. For example, an initial premium payment of $20,000 would receive a maximum bonus amount of $1,000 ($20,000 × 0.05 (tier 1)). If the initial premium payment is $100,000, the maximum bonus amount would be $5,500 ($100,000 × 0.055 (tier 2)). However, an initial premium payment of $700,000 would receive a maximum bonus amount of $39,500 ($125,000 × 0.055 (tier 2) + $375,000 × 0.055 (tier 3) + $200,000 × 0.06 (tier 4)). 
No bonus amount (or subsequent recapture thereof, as discussed below) will be based on a percentage that exceeds the maximum bonus amount percentages shown in the above table. When calculating each bonus amount, “cumulative premium payments” do not include bonus amounts previously added to Contract Value. The bonus amount is allocated among the Subaccounts in the same manner as the corresponding premium payment. The Companies may change the current bonus amount percentage, but it will never be less than the minimum guaranteed bonus amount percentage listed in the table. 
From time to time, the Companies may offer promotional programs with promotional rates for XC Class Contracts issued within specified periods of time (each, a “Promotional Period”). Such promotional programs may apply to initial and/or subsequent premium payments received during the Promotional Period. Initial and/or subsequent premium payments received after the Promotional Period will receive the current bonus amount percentage in effect at that time. The Promotional Period will never exceed the maximum bonus amount. The Companies may terminate any promotional programs or offer other promotional programs at any time in their sole discretion. 
22. If the Owner returns the Contract during the Free Look Period, then the Owner will not receive any portion of the bonus amounts (i.e., the Companies will “recapture” the full amount of each bonus). In the event of the death of the Owner (or upon the death of the first Owner to die if there are Co-Owners, or upon the death of the first Annuitant if any Owner is not a natural person), the Companies will recapture any bonus amounts corresponding to premium payments received and accepted within the previous six months of death. Thus, under the XC Class, if an optional guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) is not chosen the death benefit equals the Contract Value less any bonus amounts credited in the prior six months. If a GMDB is chosen, the death benefit equals the greater of the Contract Value less any bonus amounts credited in the prior six months or the GMDB Base (as defined above). However, in the event the Contract is continued under the spousal benefit continuation option, any bonus amounts not previously recaptured will no longer be subject to recapture as of the spousal continuation date. In the event of partial withdrawal or surrender within three years of MLLIC's or MLNY's receipt and acceptance of a premium payment, the Companies may recapture all or a portion of the corresponding bonus amount based on the bonus recapture percentages presented in the following schedule.

23. The Companies will recapture any bonus amounts subject to recapture from the Owner's Contract Value at the end of the valuation period during which the transaction request is received and accepted at MLLIC's or MLNY's Service Center. For each premium payment, the bonus amount subject to recapture is equal to the applicable bonus recapture percentage multiplied by (a) minus (b) where: (a) is the bonus amount attributable to that premium; and (b) is the sum of each Start Printed Page 77786previously recaptured bonus amount attributable to that premium payment divided by the bonus recapture percentage on the date such amount was recaptured. 
24. The Companies will deduct bonus amounts subject to recapture based on the associated premiums withdrawn from the Contract, which are determined on a “first-in, first out” (or “FIFO”) basis. Currently, the Companies do not recapture any bonus amounts on withdrawals that are within the “free withdrawal amount.” The Companies reserve the right to recapture bonus amounts on withdrawals that are within the “free withdrawal amount” in the future. The amount actually recaptured is based on the bonus amount subject to recapture multiplied by the ratio of: (i) the associated premium payment withdrawn that was subject to a surrender charge to (ii) the total amount of that premium payment remaining in the Contract immediately prior to the withdrawal that was subject to a surrender charge. The Companies will deduct any recaptured bonus amounts on a pro rata basis from among the Subaccounts the Owner is invested in, based on the ratio of the Owner's Subaccount value to his or her total Subaccount value before the partial withdrawal. 
25. If the Companies recapture a bonus amount, they will take back the bonus amount as if it had never been applied. However, the accumulated gain or loss on bonus amounts is never subject to recapture. Thus, an Owner bears any investment loss and retains any investment gain attributable to bonus amounts. The Companies will not re-credit any charges, including asset-based insurance charges, imposed on bonus amounts subsequently recaptured. 
26. Although not currently permitted, in the future the Companies may permit an Owner to partially annuitize the Contract. Partial annuitizations would be considered to be partial withdrawals for purposes of calculations under the Contract, including bonus recaptures. 
27. In addition to the fees and charges discussed above, the Companies deduct various other fees and charges. These currently include an asset-based insurance charge that varies by Subaccount (under the XC Class Contract this charge currently ranges from 1.55% to 1.80% of Subaccount assets (guaranteed not to exceed 2.00%)); a current annual contract fee of $50 (guaranteed not to exceed $75), which will apply if the greater of Contract Value or premiums less withdrawals is less than $50,000; transfer fee of $25 (guaranteed not to exceed $30) for each transfer above 12 per Contract year; premium taxes or other taxes by any governmental entity; and fees for optional benefits or riders. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. The Applicants respectfully request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, grant the exemptions set forth below to permit the Applicants to recapture all or a portion of bonus amounts attributable to premium payments under the Contract's XC Class when an Owner (1) returns the Contract during the Free Look Period; (2) dies within six months of receipt and acceptance by MLLIC or MLNY of a premium payment (unless the Contract is continued under the spousal benefit continuation option); or (3) surrenders the Contract (in full or in part) or the surrender value is paid to the Owner (because the Contract has been terminated for inactivity) within three years of receipt and acceptance by MLLIC or MLNY of a premium payment (pursuant to a bonus recapture schedule). 
2. Because the provisions described below may be inconsistent with a recapture of bonus amounts, the Applicants request exemptions for the Contracts described herein, and for Future Contracts, from Sections 2(a)(32) and 27(i)(2)(a) of the Act, and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, pursuant to Section 6(c), to the extent necessary to recapture the bonus amounts, as described above. The Applicants seek exemptions therefrom in order to avoid any questions concerning the Contracts' compliance with the Act and rules thereunder. For the reasons discussed below, the exemptions requested herein are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
3. To the extent that the bonus amount recapture might be seen as a discount from the net asset value, or might be viewed as resulting in the payment to an Owner of less than the proportionate share of the issuer's net assets, the bonus amount recapture would trigger the need for relief absent some exemption from the Act. Rule 6c-8 provides, in relevant part, that a registered separate account, and any depositor of such account, shall be exempt from Sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), 27(c)(1), 27(c)(2), and 27(d) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit them to impose a deferred sales load on any variable annuity contract participating in such account. However, the bonus amount recapture is not a sales load, but a recapture of bonus amounts MLLIC or MLNY previously attributed to an Owner's premium payments. The Companies provide the bonus amounts from their general accounts on a guaranteed basis. The Contracts are designed to be long-term investment vehicles. In undertaking this financial obligation, the Companies contemplate that an Owner will retain a Contract over an extended period, consistent with the long-term nature of the Contracts. The Companies designed the product so that they would recover their costs (including the bonus amounts) over an anticipated duration while a Contract is in force. If an Owner withdraws his money during the Free Look Period, or a death benefit is paid, or a withdrawal or surrender is made, before this anticipated period, the Companies must recapture the bonus amounts subject to recapture in order to avoid a loss. 
4. The recapture of bonus amounts does not violate Section 2(a)(32) of the Act. The bonus amount recapture provision pursuant to the Contract's XC Class does not deprive the Owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets. In the case of death of the Owner, an Owner will have the full right to any bonus amounts not previously recaptured six months following MLLIC's or MLNY's receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment. In the case of partial or full surrender, an Owner's right to a portion of a bonus amount not previously recaptured will begin one year following MLLIC's or MLNY's receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment, and an Owner will have the full right to any such remaining bonus amount three years following MLLIC's or MLNY's receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment. Until that time, the Companies retain the right and interest in the dollar amount of any bonus amounts subject to recapture. Thus, when the Companies recapture all or a portion of a bonus amount, they are only retrieving their own assets, and because an Owner does not have an interest in the bonus amount, such Owner would not be deprived of a proportionate share of the applicable Separate Account's assets (the issuer's current net assets) in violation of Section 2(a)(32). Therefore, such recapture does not reduce the amount of the applicable Separate Account's current net assets an Owner would otherwise be entitled to receive. However, to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, the Applicants request an exemption from the Start Printed Page 77787provisions of Sections (2)(a)(32) and 27(i)(2)(A) to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture all or a portion of the bonus amounts under the Contracts and Future Contracts. 
5. As a result of the bonus amounts available under the Contract's XC Class, an Owner who made an initial premium payment of $10,000 in the first Contract year could be viewed as having a Contract Value of $10,400 before any earnings accrued. The Companies' addition of bonus amounts might arguably be viewed as resulting in an Owner purchasing a redeemable security for a price below the current net asset value. Further, by recapturing the bonus amounts, the Companies might arguably be redeeming a redeemable security for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the applicable Separate Account. 
6. An Owner's interest in his or her Contract Value would always be offered at a price based on the net asset value next calculated after receipt of the order. The granting of bonus amounts does not reflect a reduction of that price. Instead, the Companies will purchase with their own general account assets an interest in the applicable Separate Account equal to the bonus amounts. Because the bonus amounts will be paid out of MLLIC's or MLNY's assets, not the applicable Separate Account's assets, no dilution will occur as a result of the bonus amounts. 
7. The recapture of bonus amounts does not involve either of the two harms that the Commission intended to eliminate or reduce with Rule 22c-1. The Commission's stated purposes in adopting Rule 22c-1 were to avoid or minimize: (1) Dilution of the interests of other security holders; and (2) speculative trading practices that are unfair to such holders. These two concerns were the result of backward pricing, the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day. Backward pricing allowed investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price, and thereby the values of outstanding mutual fund shares were diluted. 
8. The proposed recapture of bonus amounts under the Contracts does not pose such threat of dilution. The bonus amount recapture will not alter an Owner's net asset value. The Companies will determine an Owner's surrender value (an amount equal to the Contract Value reduced by any charges (including the surrender charge) and increased by any credits applied upon surrender) under a Contract in accordance with Rule 22c-1 on a basis next computed after receipt of an Owner's request for surrender (likewise, the calculation of death benefits and annuity payment amounts will be in full compliance with the forward pricing requirement of Rule 22c-1). The amount recaptured will equal all or a portion of bonus amounts that MLLIC or MLNY paid out of its general account assets.
It is not administratively feasible to track the bonus amount in the Separate Accounts after the Companies apply the bonus. As a result, the asset-based charges applicable to the Separate Accounts will be assessed against the entire amount held in the Separate Accounts, including the bonus amount, during the time the bonus amount is subject to recapture. During this time, the aggregate asset-based charges assessed against an Owner's Contract Value will be higher than those that would be charged if the Owner's Contract Value did not include the bonus amount, but the increment will obviously be only a small percentage of the bonus amount. On the other hand, an Owner will retain any investment benefit from the bonus amount. Although an Owner will retain any investment gain attributable to the bonus amounts, the Companies will determine the amount of such gain on the basis of the current net asset value of the Subaccount. Thus, no dilution will occur upon the recapture of bonus amounts. 
9. Further, the other harm that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address (speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing) will not occur as a result of MLLIC's or MLNY's recapture of a bonus amount. Variable annuities are designed for long-term investment, and by their nature, do not lend themselves to the kind of speculative short-term trading that Rule 22c-1 was designed to prevent. More to the point, the bonus recapture simply does not create the opportunity for speculative trading. 
10. Rule 22c-1 should have no application to a bonus amount, as neither of the harms that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address are present in the recapture of bonus amounts. However, to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, the Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of Rule 22c-1 to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture bonus amounts available through the XC Class under the Contracts and Future Contracts. 
11. The Commission should grant the exemptions requested in this Application, even if the bonus amounts described herein arguably conflicts with Sections 2(a)(32) or 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act or Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The bonus amount provisions are generally beneficial to Owners. The recapture provisions temper this benefit somewhat, but only if an Owner redeems his or her money under the circumstances described herein. While there would be a small downside in a declining market where an Owner would bear any losses attributable to the bonus amounts, it is the converse of the benefits an Owner would receive on the bonus amounts in a rising market. As any earnings on bonus amounts applied would not be subject to recapture and thus would be immediately available to an Owner, likewise any losses on bonus amounts would also not be subject to recapture and thus would be immediately available to an Owner. The bonus amount recapture provision does not diminish the overall value of the bonus amounts. 
12. MLLIC's or MLNY's recapture of bonus amounts is designed to prevent anti-selection against it. The risk of anti-selection would be that an Owner could make significant premium payments into the Contract solely in order to receive a quick profit from the bonus amounts. By recapturing the bonus amounts, the Companies protect themselves against the risk that an Owner will make such large premium payments, receive the bonus amounts, and then withdraw his or her money from the Contract. The Companies generally protect themselves from this kind of anti-selection, and recover their costs in situations where an Owner withdraws his or her money early in the life of a Contract, by imposing a surrender charge. However, where an Owner withdraws his money during the Free Look Period or a death benefit is paid, the Companies do not apply this charge. 
13. The Applicants seek relief herein not only for themselves with respect to the support of the Contracts, but also with respect to Future Accounts or Future Contracts described herein. The Applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Contracts or Future Contracts funded by the Separate Accounts or Future Accounts are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the Act and Commission precedent. The Commission has previously granted class relief (from certain specified provisions of the Act for separate accounts that support variable annuity contracts) that is materially similar to the relief described in this Application. Start Printed Page 77788

14. In addition, the Applicants seek relief herein with respect to Future Underwriters (i.e., a class consisting of NASD member broker-dealers that may also act as principal underwriter of the Contracts and Future Contracts). The Commission has regularly granted relief to “future underwriters” that are not named, and are not affiliates of the applicants. The Applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Future Underwriters are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the Act and Commission precedent. 
15. Without the requested class relief, exemptive relief for any Future Account, Future Contract, or Future Underwriter would have to be requested and obtained separately. These additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the Act not already addressed herein. If the Applicants were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed herein, investors would not receive additional protection or benefit, and investors and the Applicants could be disadvantaged by increased costs from preparing such additional requests for relief. The requested class relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for the Companies to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. Elimination of the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would enhance the Applicants' ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as such opportunities arise. The Applicants' request for class exemptions is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act, and that an order of the Commission including such class relief, should, therefore, be granted. Any entity that currently intends to rely on the requested exemptive order is named as an Applicant. Any entity that relies upon the requested order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions contained in this Application.

Applicants' Representations
1. TALIC is the depositor of Merrill Lynch Variable Annuity Separate Account D. TFLIC is the depositor of ML of New York Variable Annuity Separate Account D. Each Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AEGON N.V.
2. Each Account is a “separate account” as defined by rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act and each is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. Each Account is divided into sub-accounts, which reflect the investment performance of certain registered investment companies, including Transamerica Series Trust. The Accounts are administered and accounted for as part of the general business of the Companies. The application sets forth the registration statement file numbers for the security interests under the Contracts and the Accounts.Start Printed Page 15739

3. The Contracts are individual and group variable annuity contracts. Each of the prospectuses for the Contracts discloses that the issuing Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another registered open-end management investment company for shares of a registered open-end management investment company held by a sub-account of an Account.
4. Transamerica Series Trust is an open-end management investment company of the series type that is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-04419).[1] 
           Shares of the series are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 033-00507) and are sold to the separate accounts of life insurance companies to fund benefits under variable life policies or variable annuity contracts and to certain affiliated asset allocation funds.
5. Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), an investment adviser that is registered with the Commission, has overall responsibility for the management of each Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Fund. TAM delegates to a sub-adviser the responsibility for day-to-day management of the investments of each Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Fund, subject to TAM's oversight. TAM may, in the future, determine to provide the day-to-day management of any Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Fund without the use of a sub-adviser.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Funds for shares of the Existing Funds (“Substitutions”) to fund the Contracts:
Existing fundReplacement fundAllianzGI NFJ Mid-Cap Value Fund (A)Transamerica JPMorgan Mid Cap Value VP (Service Class).American Century Equity Income Fund (A)Transamerica Barrow Hanley Dividend Focused VP (Service Class).American Century Ultra Fund (A)Transamerica Jennison Growth VP (Service Class).Columbia Acorn USA (A)Transamerica T. Rowe Price Small Cap VP (Service Class).Columbia Acorn International (A)Transamerica MFS International Equity VP (Initial Class).Pioneer Emerging Markets Fund (A)Transamerica TS&W International Equity VP (Service Class).Templeton Foreign Fund (A)Transamerica MFS International Equity VP (Initial Class).Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund V (formerly known as Columbia Marsico Growth Fund) (A)Transamerica WMC US Growth VP (Service Class).
7. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Funds have investment objectives, policies and risk profiles, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially the same as, or sufficiently similar to, the corresponding Existing Funds to make those Replacement Funds appropriate candidates as substitutes. Applicants also state that the investment objectives and investment strategies of each Replacement Fund are similar to the corresponding Existing Fund, or each Replacement Fund's underlying portfolio construction and investment results are similar to those of the Existing Fund and therefore the fundamental objectives, risk and performance expectations of those Contract owners with interests in sub-accounts of the Existing Funds will continue to be met after the Substitutions.
8. The investment objectives of each Existing Fund and its corresponding Replacement Fund are set forth below. Additional information for each Existing Fund and Replacement Fund, including principal investment strategies, principal risks and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
Existing fundReplacement fundAllianzGI NFJ Mid-Cap Value Fund seeks long-term growth of capital and incomeTransamerica JPMorgan Mid Cap Value seeks growth from capital appreciation.American Century Equity Income Fund seeks current income. Capital appreciation is a secondary objectiveTransamerica Barrow Hanley Dividend Focused VP Seeks total return gained from the combination of dividend yield, growth of dividends and capital appreciation.American Century Ultra Fund seeks long-term growth of capitalTransamerica Jennison Growth VP seeks long-term growth of capital.Columbia Acorn USA seeks long-term capital appreciationTransamerica T. Rowe Price Small Cap VP seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in common stocks of small growth companies.Columbia Acorn International seeks long term capital appreciationTransamerica MFS International Equity VP seeks capital growth.Pioneer Emerging Markets Fund seeks long term growth of capitalTransamerica TS&W International Equity VP seeks maximum long-term total return, consistent with reasonable risk to principal, by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of primarily non-U.S. issuers.Templeton Foreign Fund seeks long-term capital growthTransamerica MFS International Equity VP seeks capital growth.Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund V seeks long-term growth of capitalTransamerica WMC US Growth VP seeks to maximize long-term growth.
9. Applicants state that the Substitutions are designed to allow Contract owners to continue their investment in similar or better investment options without interruption and at no additional cost to them. Contract owners with sub-account balances invested through the Accounts in shares of the Replacement Funds will have the same or lower total expense ratios taking into account fund expenses (including Rule 12b-1 fees, if any). With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees Start Printed Page 15740paid by the Replacement Fund are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Fund. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Fund and its corresponding Replacement Fund in greater detail.
10. Applicants represent that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Effective Date”) shares of the Existing Funds will be redeemed for cash. The Companies, on behalf of each Existing Fund sub-account of each relevant Account, will simultaneously place a redemption request with each Existing Fund and a purchase order with the corresponding Replacement Fund so that the purchase of Replacement Fund shares will be for the exact amount of the redemption proceeds. Thus, Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
11. The Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value (in accordance with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act) with no change in the amount of any affected Contract owner's contract value, cash value, accumulation value, account value or death benefit or in dollar value of his or her investment in the applicable Accounts.[2] 
           No brokerage commissions or other fees will be paid by either the Existing Funds or the Replacement Funds or by the affected Contract owners in connection with the Substitutions.
12. The affected Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions nor will their rights or the Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. The Companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses. The Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by affected Contract owners to be greater after the Substitutions than before the Substitutions. Moreover, the Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on affected Contract owners.
13. As described in the application, after notification of the Substitution and for 30 days after the Effective Date, affected Contract owners may reallocate the sub-account value of an Existing Fund to any other investment option available under their Contract without incurring any transfer charges.
14. All Contract owners affected by the Substitutions will be notified of this application by means of supplements to the Contract prospectuses at least 30 days prior to the Effective Date. The notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the notice until the Effective Date, owners are permitted to make one transfer of Contract value out of the Existing Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that the Companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the Effective Date.
15. If affected Contract owners reallocate account value during this 60 day period, there will be no charge for the reallocation of accumulated value from the Existing Fund sub-accounts and the reallocation will not count as a transfer when imposing any applicable restriction or limit under the Contract on transfers. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Funds at least 30 days before the Effective Date.
16. Within five (5) business days after the Effective Date, affected Contract owners will be sent a written confirmation, which will include confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified, a restatement of the information set forth in the pre-Substitution notice and values of the Contract owner's position in the Existing Fund before the Substitution and the Replacement Fund after the Substitution.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the Substitutions. Section 26(c) requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust. Section 26(c) requires the Commission to issue such an order if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
2. Applicants submit that the terms and conditions of the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that the replacement of an Existing Fund with the corresponding Replacement Fund is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the l940 Act. As described in the application, for a period of two years following the Effective Date, the Companies or their affiliates will reimburse any Contract owner affected by the proposed Substitutions involving Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Funds and whose sub-account invests in the Replacement Fund to the extent a Replacement Fund's net annual operating expenses exceeds the net annual operating expenses of the corresponding Existing Fund. Applicants further assert that each Replacement Fund has similar investment objectives and investment strategies as the corresponding Existing Fund, or each Replacement Fund's underlying portfolio construction and investment results are similar to those of the corresponding Existing Fund. Accordingly, Applicants believe that the fundamental investment objectives, risk and performance expectations of the Contract owners will continue to be met after the Substitutions.
3. Applicants also maintain that it is in the best interests of the Contract owners to substitute the Replacement Fund for its corresponding Existing Fund. Applicants anticipate that the substitution of an Existing Fund with the corresponding Replacement Fund will result in a Contract that is administered and managed more efficiently, and one that is more competitive with other variable products. The rights of affected Contract Owners and the obligations of the Companies under the Contracts will not be altered by the Substitutions. Affected Contract owners will not incur any additional tax liability or any additional fees and expenses as a result of the Substitutions.
4. Each of the prospectuses for the Contracts discloses that the issuing Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another registered open-end management investment company for shares of an open-end management investment company held by a sub-account of an Account.
5. Applicants also assert that none of the proposed Substitutions is of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Unlike a traditional unit investment trust where a depositor could only substitute an investment Start Printed Page 15741security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust, the Contracts provide each Contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer account values into other sub-accounts. Moreover, the Contracts will offer affected Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected sub-accounts into any of the remaining sub-accounts without cost or other disadvantage. The Substitution, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemptions that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Applicants also maintain that the Substitutions are unlike the type of substitutions which Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a Contract, Contract owners select much more than a particular registered management open-end investment company in which to invest their account values. They also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the Companies under their Contracts as well as other rights and privileges set forth in the Contracts.

Applicants' Conditions:

Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The proposed Substitutions will not be effected unless the Companies determine that: (a) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (b) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (c) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. The Companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the Contract owners to effect the Substitutions.
3. The proposed Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
4. The proposed Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for affected Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
5. The rights or obligations of the Companies under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
6. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the sub-account investing in the Existing Fund (before the Effective Date) or the Replacement Fund (after the Effective Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Effective Date through at least 30 days following the Effective Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Company will not exercise any right it may have under the Contract to impose restrictions on transfers between the sub-accounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Effective Date through at least 30 days following the Effective Date.
7. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Effective Date about: (a) The intended substitution of Existing Funds with the Replacement Funds; (b) the intended Effective Date; and (c) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 6 above. In addition, the Companies will deliver to all affected Contract owners, at least 30 days before the Effective Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Fund.
8. The Companies will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five (5) business days of the Effective Date a written confirmation which will include: (a) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (b) a restatement of the information set forth in the pre-Substitution notice; and (c) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Fund before the Substitution and the Replacement Fund after the Substitution.
9. After the Effective Date the Applicants agree not to change a Replacement Fund's sub- adviser without first obtaining shareholder approval of either (a) the sub-adviser change or (b) the parties' continued ability to rely on their manager-of-managers exemptive order.
10. For two years following the Effective Date the net annual expenses of each Replacement Fund that is a Transamerica Series Trust Fund will not exceed the net annual expenses of the corresponding Existing Fund as of the fund's most recent fiscal year. To achieve this limitation, the Replacement Fund's investment adviser will waive fees or reimburse the Replacement Fund in certain amounts to maintain expenses at or below the limit. Any adjustments will be made at least on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges, including asset based charges such as mortality expense risk charges deducted from the sub-accounts that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Effective Date.

2.
     Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Funds and Replacement Funds, which Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

11 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































11 Tips You Absolutely Must Know About Annuities  




Tip #11: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation. 





Get My Annuity Report Now!


2017's Best Annuities - Find the annuities with the highest rates, lowest fees and highest guaranteed returns in our free report




Tip #10: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. The rates for CD-type annuities remain the same for the term. 







Tip #8: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund”, the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.  Annuities avoid probate, so select the right beneficiary!




Tip #9:
  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. You also want to diversify. Don't invest all of your savings with 1 company. 







Tip #5: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees.

Tip #7: Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up.  Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.  You should do the same. 




Tip #6: You might have seen annuity ads where an annuity earned 12-15% with no risk. These come from "uncapped" index annuities. These returns are possible when market indexes go up considerably. Keep in mind these returns are not normal. 




Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today. Our free report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases to find the highest guaranteed returns.

Tip #4:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% gross and you pay 3-4% in fees, you may be better off in fixed products.




Tip #3: Shop around. Don't buy any annuity until you compare the rates, benefits and fees of all of the products available.   Rates vary considerably! The top 5 year fixed annuity is now paying 220% more interest than the bottom in our database. 




Tip #2:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income rider, we can compare 150+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 











Tip #1:
 Longevity annuities (DIA's) allow you to take a lump sum and turn it into "income later". The US treasury department and IRS have endorsed this type of annuity in recent years and made them more accessible in 401(k) plans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
