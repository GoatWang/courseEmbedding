About Happy Tax
Happy Tax’s on-­demand, concierge model was born out of consumer frustration with unreliable, under­-qualified tax preparers with no licensing or certification and as little as five days of tax training. The virtual tax office designed by Happy Tax bridges the gap between the high­-quality, pampered and convenient customer service that consumers want, and accurate, reliable and professional tax returns prepared by CPAs with a minimum of 5 years of training and experience. Happy Tax offers franchises to those wanting to earn additional income and build their own business. Utilizing its patent­-pending technology and processes, Happy Tax franchisees are able to operate with low overhead and increased flexibility.
Company History
Happy Tax was founded by tax industry veteran and serial entrepreneur Mario Costanz to help people to earn extra income without quitting their job or having to do taxes. Mario started out doing taxes on the side to earn extra money. Once he built up his client following, he made the leap and opened up his own office. After a few years of going at it alone, purchased a tax preparation franchise. And then he purchased another, and another…until he became an area developer, coaching and helping other people fulfill their own dreams of business ownership. Over time, he had ownership in 99 tax offices across the country, which were sold prior to the founding of Happy Tax.
