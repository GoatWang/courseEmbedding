Women's Shoe Width Guidelines

B width is a medium (M) width; this is the regular or average width.
A, AA, AAA, etc. are narrow widths. The more "A's" the narrower the shoe. Every "A" decreases the width by ¼ inch.
D, E, EE, etc. are wide width shoes. For every letter you go up, ¼ inch is added to the width. Also, for every extra "E" (i.e. E to EE), an extra ¼ inch is added.
The letters "D", "W", "EE" and "WW" refer to the width of the foot, not the size of the calf.

Back to top
Other Fit Tips

If you need a ½ size, and one is not offered, order the next size up (i.e. need 9 ½, order 10).
If you need a narrow width and a narrow is not available, you may want to order one ½ size down.
If you need a wide width and a wide is not available, you may want to order ½ size up.
If one foot is larger than the other, order for the larger foot.
For women ordering men’s sized shoes order 1 ½ sizes down (i.e. women’s size 9 = men’s size 7 ½).
For men ordering women’s sized shoes order 1 ½ sizes up (men’s size 8 = women’s size 9 ½).
If a style is not running true to size, we will provide a fit recommendation.
A properly fitted shoe should have approximately ½ to ¾ of an inch of space from the end of your toe to the end of the shoe.

 
Heel Height Guidelines

Heel heights are measured on the middle of the heel as shown here. Heel heights are also determined by the size of the shoe. As the shoe gets larger, the heel gets proportionately higher. In other words, the heel on a size 6 will not be as high as a heel on a size 11.

	When going "gluten free" becomes a necessity to your lively-hood, it is important to have the right products which truly adhere to the strict standards of a gluten-free lifestyle. Personal Basics Skin Care and Make Up products are Gluten Free and meet these requirements. We have also created gluten free toothpastes which are both safe as well as refreshing. Also, we carry a variety of our own gluten free lip glosses and lipsticks in a variety of fantastic colors.
	

Fragrance Free

	Not only are our products salicylate free and gluten free, but they are also fragrance free. If you find yourself having reactions to skin care products or cosmetics, you may have an allergy to certain fragrances. Also, many who may have intolerances to gluten or salicylates may in fact also have intolerances to fragrances. Therefore, our products are also formulated to be completely fragrance-free. Through our entire line of products, from our cleansers, moisturizers, and makeup to our hair care, you will find products that are ideal for those with these types of allergies and intolerances.
	

	While Personal Basics by Andrea Rose may lack these 3 ingredients commonly featured in hundreds of other brands, they still deliver and exceed all expectations. Our customers keep coming back to find their favorite products (and new products) that deliver the amazing results they've come to expect and love!
