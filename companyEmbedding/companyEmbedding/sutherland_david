Sutherland, a True Pioneer in Organics
Sutherland Produce Sales, Inc. (Sutherland Produce) is a privately-held sales agent and distributor of top-quality organic produce. It offers a wide variety of certified organic fruit and vegetables including citrus, table grapes, melons, hard fruit, stone fruit, and vegetables that include potatoes, peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers among others. The company was founded in 1987 by Bill Sutherland who is widely considered a true pioneer in organics and one of the most influential players in helping to define, shape and establish universal standards and laws that govern organic farming and the industry today.
The company serves customers ranging from small regional wholesalers and distributors to leading retailers like Whole Foods Market. It is the proud recipient of the prestigious “XXXX” Blue Book rating and a Blue Book trading member since 2004.
About Sutherland







Organically Delicious Fruit
Organically delicious is not just another marketing tagline. It’s a commitment. A commitment that began even before there was a Sutherland Produce. It began when Bill Sutherland first discovered and tasted the organic difference almost 40 years ago. After a decade in the field, Sutherland Produce was founded on a commitment to deliver fresh from farm to kitchen the best tasting organically grown fruit from top organic growers in the West. Growers, most with Sutherland since the beginning, who share in this commitment to consistently provide the finest organic fruit possible, while maintaining the strictest organic standards and the highest regard for a sustainable environment. 
Organically delicious…it’s what your customers deserve and what makes Sutherland Produce your source for top-quality, organic produce.

Organically Delicious Vegetables
Fresh, nutritious and organically delicious. That’s what you can expect every time from Sutherland Produce and its quality growers. Like all of our produce, our commitment to delivering the best tasting organically grown vegetables is a commitment we don’t take lightly. It’s a commitment and tradition that Sutherland, the man, industry pioneer and successful company, has stood for since the very beginning, almost 40 years ago. We pride ourselves on representing only the best growers who have proven themselves over the years to grow and consistently deliver the finest-tasting organic vegetables at fair and reasonable prices, enabling them to maintain best practices in environmentally responsible farming.

Organically Certified Growers
Since 1977, Bill Sutherland has played an active role in helping define, shape and establish the standards of organic farming. So when he founded Sutherland Produce in 1987, he understood the importance of representing only the best quality growers. They would need to share his commitment for producing the best-tasting, nutritiously delicious organic produce, while adhering to the strictest sustainable agricultural standards that he and other pioneers worked so hard to establish. He would consider his growers true partners, working with them to deliver consistent quality and value from farm to table. As a result, both Sutherland and its growers would prosper, and in very short order, the company would earn the prestigious “XXXX” Blue Book rating. 
Today, Sutherland Produce represents organically certified growers, many from the company’s first days, throughout California, the Pacific Northwest and Mexico.

History
Genuine Style, Iconic Design
Genuine Style, Iconic Design
David Sutherland, President and CEO of Perennials and Sutherland, LLC and co-owner of Sutherland Furniture® and Perennials Luxury Performance Fabrics®, is known for bringing a fresh point of view to design while creating refined collections for casual contemporary living both indoors and out.











1978
David Sutherland launched his first showroom in Houston. A short time later, a second showroom was added in Dallas, where the 25,000-square-foot corporate headquarters is located today. The Los Angeles showroom opened in 1999 and underwent expansion in 2004 and again in 2014. Success with Sutherland’s proprietary products in Los Angeles, Houston and Dallas led to the opening of two more showrooms in New York’s well-known Design & Decoration building and the Design Center of the Americas in Dania Beach, Florida in 2005. This expansion was a natural progression in two major markets for Sutherland to showcase new indoor and outdoor collections to the interior design community.











1994
This year marked the launch of Sutherland® Furniture with an outdoor collection of 35 pieces introduced at the San Francisco Market. A collaboration between David Sutherland and internationally-acclaimed furniture designer John Hutton, this collection created a new niche in the outdoor furniture market. For the first time, innovative design defined exciting outdoor rooms that possessed all the comfort, style and utility of indoor spaces. Sutherland pioneered tailored-cushion “deep-seating” collections for the outdoors and was the first company to introduce fully-upholstered outdoor collections.











1997
Responding to a need by interior designers and architects for high-performance outdoor fabrics with indoor fabric design sensibilities, David Sutherland’s personal and professional partnership with his wife, Ann, led to the formation of a new company: Perennials®. Partnering with John Hutton again, Perennials introduced innovative colors, patterns and textures using 100% Solution-Dyed Acrylic in collections from major designers. Perennials’ trademark fiber design technology leads the industry with soil, stain and UV resistance while exceeding the demanding abrasion ratings required by the contract market.











2016 and Beyond
Perennials and Sutherland, LLC continues to expand into new markets and distribution channels for Sutherland® and Perennials® products, while David Sutherland Showrooms keep redefining trends in the professional showroom and shopping experience. Sutherland continues to collaborate with the world’s design luminaries while expanding their offerings with new materials and innovative methods of manufacturing and craftsmanship. Meanwhile, Perennials product designers stretch the boundaries of possibility using the company’s trademark 100% Solution-dyed Acrylic fiber; innovations in yarns, construction and new product categories provide a springboard into fabrics, rugs, trims and specialty embroidery products to inspire the design community.

As a result, ownership is making a fortune at the expense of the showroom staff who sell the higher priced, branded product. Zero training or support. Toxic culture.

Sales support team is helpless. They are overworked, underpaid, and irresponsible, they are making clients very angry because they never follow up with vendors and clients, and then they treat the receptionist like their servant, giving her hundreds of folders to tag, and to put on fedex while they have an office party.Advice to ManagementSpecifically in sales, you need more people in your team because your clients are unhappy. And teach them that the receptionist is not their personal assistant, and that they need to all be able to do everyones job so that when they are gone, their clients dont have to call back hours later thats if they even answer at allShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) David Sutherland Response Nov 18, 2014 – Director of Human Resources Thank you for your note.

For me, the positives outweighed the negatives. There's a family atmosphere. Creativity is valued and fostered. Opportunities for advancement exist because it's a growing company. They have some exceptional employees in key positions. They are unafraid of making mistakes or taking risks (in a good way). They have an established brand built on high-quality products.ConsOne downside to the family atmosphere is nepotism.

                           Although pancreas transplants have been performed for more than 30 years, the last few years have witnessed significant growth
                              in the options available for pancreas transplantation. Transplantation of the Pancreas, edited by Drs. Gruessner and Sutherland
                              provides a state-of-the-art, definitive reference work on pancreas transplantation for transplant surgeons and physicians
                              as well as for endocrinologists, diabetologists, nephrologists, and neurologists. The editors, from the renowned University
                              of Minnesota Transplant Division and the Diabetes Institute, have assembled a group of renowned experts to provide an all-inclusive
                              overview of pancreas transplantation. The text features insights on the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and the limitations
                              of nontransplant treatments, highlights experimental research and clinical history of pancreas transplantation, and compares
                              and contrasts different surgical procedures. The discussions detail the broad spectrum of post-transplant complications and
                              their treatments, which frequently require skills in general, vascular, and laparoscopic surgery; interventional radiology;
                              critical care; and infectious disease. Chapters on pretransplant evaluation, immunosuppression, immunology, pathology, long-term
                              outcome, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness focus on issues unique to pancreas recipients. Evolving areas, such as pretransplant
                              evaluation of pancreas transplant candidates, living donation, and the current status of islet transplantation are discussed.
                              Augmented by more than 280 illustrations, including full color line drawings created exclusively for the text, this book is
                              the standard reference for all transplant professionals as well as for all physicians caring for the transplant patient

                              to the progress of biomedical care. Examples of advances in medicine through animal research are presented. Also, alternatives
                              to, and methods of, reducing the use of animals in research are explored. The limitations of animals in research and the use
                              of animals in teaching are discussed

                           Transplantation Surgery uniquely covers all aspects of this rapidly expanding field in one volume. The book gives a clear
                              description of the current status of transplant surgery for trainees sitting surgery exit examinations. The book will also
                              be of interest to transplant surgeons, physicians and nephrologists who have an interest in this field. It opens with an introductory
                              chapter on the history of transplantation and the basic science of immunobiology, and then examines the practice of transplantation
                              in each major system. No other book covers the breadth of this topic in a single volume. Each contributor to Transplantation
                              Surgery is an internationally recognised expert. Nadey S Hakim is Consultant Surgeon and Surgical Director of the Transplant
                              Unit based at St Mary's Hospital, London, UK. Gabriel M Danovitch is Medical Director of the Kidney Transplant Program, Center
                              for the Health Sciences, Los Angeles, California, USA. Both have been personally involved in many of the major developments
                              in transplantation. Transplantation Surgery is the first volume to appear with the Springer Specialist Surgery Series (edited
