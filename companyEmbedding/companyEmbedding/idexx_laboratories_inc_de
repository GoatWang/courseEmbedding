ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS


                                        








The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10�K.


                                        








We have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the "Glossary of Terms and Selected Abbreviations."


                                        








Description of Business Segments.  We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group ("CAG"); water quality products ("Water"); and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food, which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy ("LPD").  Our Other operating segment combines and presents products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market ("OPTI Medical") with our pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas.


                                        








During the second quarter of 2016, we renamed our customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems line of business in the CAG segment to veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems. Financial results were not adjusted as a result of this name change.


                                        








During the fourth quarter of 2016, we modified our management reporting to rename IDEXX VetLab service and accessories to CAG Diagnostics service and accessories and reclassified the location of SNAP Pro service plans previously located in CAG Diagnostics capital - instruments to CAG Diagnostics service and accessories. The amount of revenue reclassified was $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The amount reclassified was less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.


                                        








Certain costs not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption "Unallocated Amounts". These costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate, which primarily consist of our R&D function, regional or country expenses, certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currency and unusual items. Corporate support function costs (such as information technology, facilities, human resources, finance and legal), health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at pre-determined budgeted amounts or rates. Differences from these pre-determined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within Unallocated Amounts.


                                        








Effective January 1, 2016, we modified our management reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization and subsequent recognition of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs, which adjusts the timing of cost recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold. Prior to January 1, 2016, the capitalization and subsequent recognition of these variances were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption "Unallocated Amounts".


                                        








The segment gross profit and income (loss) from operations within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, has been retrospectively revised to reflect the changes to our segment performance metrics described above. The following is a summary of revised segment gross profit from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business.


                                        








Companion Animal Group


                                        








Our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management. By doing so, we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers and expanding practice revenues.


                                        








CAG Diagnostics. We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians' diverse needs through a variety of modalities including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient's diagnostic results, which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight.


                                        








The breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution. To further increase our customer reach, effective January 1, 2015, we transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and did not renew our annual contracts with our U.S. distribution partners. Under this approach, we take orders, ship product, invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and IDEXX VetLab consumables in the U.S., aligning with our direct model for instruments, reference laboratory services, and other CAG products and services. We believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in North America.


                                        








Our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments and our SNAP Pro Mobile Device are non-recurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once. Revenues from the associated proprietary IDEXX VetLab consumables, SNAP rapid assay test kits, reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our IDEXX VetLab instruments and our SNAP Pro Mobile Device are recurring in nature, in that they are regularly purchased by our customers, typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services. Our recurring revenues, most prominently IDEXX VetLab consumables and rapid assay test kits, have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales. Therefore, the mix of recurring and non-recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins.


                                        








Diagnostic Capital Revenue. Revenues related to the placement of the IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes. During the early stage of an instrument's life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. In the early stage of an instrument's life cycle, placements are made primarily through sales transactions.  As the market for the product matures, an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions, sometimes referred to as "reagent rentals," in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a long-term customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables.


                                        








Prior to the Catalyst One instrument launch during November 2014, we pre-sold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a Catalyst One were initially provided with the right to use a Catalyst Dx instrument. Under this marketing program, we deferred $7 million of instrument revenue in 2014, which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the Catalyst One instruments or customer election to keep the Catalyst Dx was received.


                                        








We place our Catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales, leases, rental and other programs. In addition, we continue to place VetTest instruments through sales, lease, rental and other programs, with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales. As of December 31, 2016, these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 43,000 units globally, as compared to 40,000 units globally in 2015.  Approximately 50 percent of 2016 Catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to IDEXX, including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors, sometimes referred to as competitive accounts. Generally, placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue, whereas the consumable stream associated with a Catalyst placement at a VetTest customer substitutes a Catalyst consumable stream for a VetTest consumable stream. We have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a VetTest analyzer to a Catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability, flexibility and ease of use of the Catalyst analyzers, which leads to additional testing by the customer.


                                        








As we continue to experience growth in placements of Catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of VetTest analyzers and in sales of related consumables.


                                        








The LaserCyte Dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2013.  In addition, we sell the ProCyte Dx  LaserCyte and VetAutoread analyzers. As of December 31, 2016, these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 31,000 units, as compared to 29,000 units in 2015 and 27,000 units in 2014. A substantial portion of ProCyte Dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their LaserCyte analyzer to a ProCyte Dx analyzer. In 2016,  approximately 50 percent of ProCyte placements were made at competitive accounts. We also continue to place a substantial number of LaserCyte Dx and LaserCyte instruments, both new and recertified, as trade-ups from the VetAutoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts. As we continue to experience growth in placements of ProCyte Dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of LaserCyte and VetAutoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream.


                                        








Our SediVue Dx instrument, which we launched in North America early in 2016 and in the U.K. and Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, is the first and only in-clinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis. This instrument and single-use consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the in-house process of examining urine under a microscope. We provide customers with SediVue Dx consumables that are charged upon utilization, which we refer to as pay-per-run, as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables. We reported total revenues of $24.2 million from SediVue Dx instrument and pay-per-run sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.


                                        








We seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our SNAP rapid assay tests,  by providing the SNAP Pro Mobile Device, which activates SNAP tests, properly times the run, captures,  and saves images of the results and, in conjunction with IVLS, records invoice charges in the patient record. Beginning in January of 2017, with our ProRead software, the SNAP Pro Mobile Device will interpret results. These features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced. In addition, SNAP Pro Mobile Device results can be shared with pet owners on the SNAP Pro screen or, in conjunction with IVLS, via VetConnect PLUS. We also sell the SNAPshot Dx, which automatically reads certain SNAP test results and, in conjunction with IVLS, records those results in the electronic medical record. We continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products.


                                        








Prior to 2014, the SNAPshot Dx was our primary in-clinic solution for screening thyroid disease, cortisol, bile acids and interpreting SNAP rapid assay tests. Upon the launch of the total thyroxine ("T4") slide for use with our Catalyst analyzers during 2015, we experienced a decline in SNAPshot Dx placements. We reported revenues of $1.1 million from SNAPshot DX placements during the year ended December 31, 2016, which reflects approximately a $0.4 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year. We reported revenues of $1.5 million from SNAPshot Dx during the year ended December 31, 2015, which reflects approximately a $1 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year. We will continue to service the existing SNAPshot Dx install base.


                                        








Our long-term success in the continuing growth of our CAG recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues, our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers. We continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing work flows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. Our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. In addition, we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis.


                                        








With all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors' products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of software, integration with the IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS, client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price.


                                        








Recurring Diagnostic Revenue. Revenues from our proprietary IDEXX VetLab consumable products, our SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our CAG Diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature. For the year ended December 31, 2016, recurring diagnostic revenue, which is both highly durable and profitable, accounts for approximately 72 percent of our consolidated revenue.


                                        








Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our IDEXX VetLab consumable products and SNAP rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. Our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times.


                                        








We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in IDEXX VetLab instruments and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument. Our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing IDEXX VetLab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables. Utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. Our strategy is to increase both drivers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry, hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes, as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians. Additionally, we have found that veterinarian adoption of VetConnect PLUS drives utilization by spurring testing across all IDEXX diagnostic modalities. In connection with the purchase of instruments, we also offer protocol-based rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers.


                                        








Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include SNAP rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity, as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once, including the ability to utilize our SNAP Pro mobile device. We further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing.


                                        








The expiration of a third party's U.S. lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation SNAP rapid assay products, including Heartworm RT, FIV/FeLV Combo Test, Feline Triple, Parvo and Giardia. These companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price. In the second half of 2015, we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our Canine and Feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform, and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs. Our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our SNAP platform, which is unique in using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ("ELISA") technology. Test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these in-house tests, given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice.


                                        








We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In several markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service and tools such as VetConnect PLUS that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings.


                                        








Profitability in our lab business is supported, in part, by our expanding business scale globally. Profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies. When possible, we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries, expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference . . .

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10�K.  We have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the "Glossary of Terms and Selected Abbreviations."  Description of Business Segments. We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group ("CAG"); water quality products ("Water"); and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food, which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy ("LPD"). Our Other operating segment combines and presents products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market ("OPTI Medical") with our pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas.  During the second quarter of 2016, we renamed our customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems line of business in the CAG segment to veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems. Financial results were not adjusted as a result of this name change.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we modified our management reporting to rename IDEXX VetLab service and accessories to CAG Diagnostics service and accessories and reclassified the location of SNAP Pro service plans previously located in CAG Diagnostics capital - instruments to CAG Diagnostics service and accessories. The amount of revenue reclassified was $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The amount reclassified was less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Certain costs not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption "Unallocated Amounts". These costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate, which primarily consist of our R&D function, regional or country expenses, certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currency and unusual items. Corporate support function costs (such as information technology, facilities, human resources, finance and legal), health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at pre-determined budgeted amounts or rates. Differences from these pre-determined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within Unallocated Amounts.  Effective January 1, 2016, we modified our management reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization and subsequent recognition of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs, which adjusts the timing of cost recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold. Prior to January 1, 2016, the capitalization and subsequent recognition of these variances were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption "Unallocated Amounts".  The segment gross profit and income (loss) from operations within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, has been retrospectively revised to reflect the changes to our segment performance metrics described above.

Companion Animal Group  Our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management. By doing so, we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers and expanding practice revenues.  CAG Diagnostics. We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians' diverse needs through a variety of modalities including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient's diagnostic results, which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight.  The breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution. To further increase our customer reach, effective January 1, 2015, we transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and did not renew our annual contracts with our U.S. distribution partners. Under this approach, we take orders, ship product, invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and IDEXX VetLab consumables in the U.S., aligning with our direct model for instruments, reference laboratory services, and other CAG products and services. We believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in North America.  Our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments and our SNAP Pro Mobile Device are non-recurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once. Revenues from the associated proprietary IDEXX VetLab consumables, SNAP rapid assay test kits, reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our IDEXX VetLab instruments and our SNAP Pro Mobile Device are recurring in nature, in that they are regularly purchased by our customers, typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services. Our recurring revenues, most prominently IDEXX VetLab consumables and rapid assay test kits, have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales. Therefore, the mix of recurring and non-recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins.  Diagnostic Capital Revenue. Revenues related to the placement of the IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes. During the early stage of an instrument's life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. In the early stage of an instrument's life cycle, placements are made primarily through sales transactions. As the market for the product matures, an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions, sometimes referred to as "reagent rentals," in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a long-term customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables.  Prior to the Catalyst One instrument launch during November 2014, we pre-sold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a Catalyst One were initially provided with the right to use a Catalyst Dx instrument. Under this marketing program, we deferred $7 million of instrument revenue in 2014, which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the Catalyst One instruments or customer election to keep the Catalyst Dx was received.  We place our Catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales, leases, rental and other programs. In addition, we continue to place VetTest instruments through sales, lease, rental and other programs, with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales. As of December 31, 2016, these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 43,000 units globally, as compared to 40,000 units globally in 2015. Approximately 50 percent of 2016 Catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to IDEXX, including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors, sometimes referred to as competitive accounts. Generally, placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue, whereas the consumable stream associated with a Catalyst placement at a VetTest customer substitutes a Catalyst consumable stream for a VetTest consumable stream. We have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a VetTest analyzer to a Catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability, flexibility and ease of use of the Catalyst analyzers, which leads to additional testing by the customer.  As we continue to experience growth in placements of Catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of VetTest analyzers and in sales of related consumables.  The LaserCyte Dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2013. In addition, we sell the ProCyte Dx LaserCyte and VetAutoread analyzers. As of December 31, 2016, these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 31,000 units, as compared to 29,000 units in 2015 and 27,000 units in 2014. A substantial portion of ProCyte Dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their LaserCyte analyzer to a ProCyte Dx analyzer. In 2016, approximately 50 percent of ProCyte placements were made at competitive accounts. We also continue to place a substantial number of LaserCyte Dx and LaserCyte instruments, both new and recertified, as trade-ups from the VetAutoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts. As we continue to experience growth in placements of ProCyte Dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of LaserCyte and VetAutoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream.  Our SediVue Dx instrument, which we launched in North America early in 2016 and in the U.K. and Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, is the first and only in-clinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis. This instrument and single-use consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the in-house process of examining urine under a microscope. We provide customers with SediVue Dx consumables that are charged upon utilization, which we refer to as pay-per-run, as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables. We reported total revenues of $24.2 million from SediVue Dx instrument and pay-per-run sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.  We seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our SNAP rapid assay tests, by providing the SNAP Pro Mobile Device, which activates SNAP tests, properly times the run, captures, and saves images of the results and, in conjunction with IVLS, records invoice charges in the patient record. Beginning in January of 2017, with our ProRead software, the SNAP Pro Mobile Device will interpret results. These features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced. In addition, SNAP Pro Mobile Device results can be shared with pet owners on the SNAP Pro screen or, in conjunction with IVLS, via VetConnect PLUS. We also sell the SNAPshot Dx, which automatically reads certain SNAP test results and, in conjunction with IVLS, records those results in the electronic medical record. We continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products.  Prior to 2014, the SNAPshot Dx was our primary in-clinic solution for screening thyroid disease, cortisol, bile acids and interpreting SNAP rapid assay tests. Upon the launch of the total thyroxine ("T4") slide for use with our Catalyst analyzers during 2015, we experienced a decline in SNAPshot Dx placements. We reported revenues of $1.1 million from SNAPshot DX placements during the year ended December 31, 2016, which reflects approximately a $0.4 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year. We reported revenues of $1.5 million from SNAPshot Dx during the year ended December 31, 2015, which reflects approximately a $1 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year. We will continue to service the existing SNAPshot Dx install base.  Our long-term success in the continuing growth of our CAG recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues, our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers. We continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing work flows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. Our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. In addition, we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis.  With all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors' products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of software, integration with the IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS, client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price.  Recurring Diagnostic Revenue. Revenues from our proprietary IDEXX VetLab consumable products, our SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our CAG Diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature. For the year ended December 31, 2016, recurring diagnostic revenue, which is both highly durable and profitable, accounts for approximately 72 percent of our consolidated revenue.  Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our IDEXX VetLab consumable products and SNAP rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. Our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times.  We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in IDEXX VetLab instruments and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument. Our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing IDEXX VetLab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables. Utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. Our strategy is to increase both drivers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry, hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes, as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians. Additionally, we have found that veterinarian adoption of VetConnect PLUS drives utilization by spurring testing across all IDEXX diagnostic modalities. In connection with the purchase of instruments, we also offer protocol-based rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers.  Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include SNAP rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity, as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once, including the ability to utilize our SNAP Pro mobile device. We further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing.  The expiration of a third party's U.S. lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation SNAP rapid assay products, including Heartworm RT, FIV/FeLV Combo Test, Feline Triple, Parvo and Giardia. These companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price. In the second half of 2015, we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our Canine and Feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform, and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs. Our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our SNAP platform, which is unique in using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ("ELISA") technology. Test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these in-house tests, given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice.  We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In several markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service and tools such as VetConnect PLUS that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings.  Profitability in our lab business is supported, in part, by our expanding business scale globally. Profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies. When possible, we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries, expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference . . .

Products & Services[edit]
Companion Animal Group[edit]
The Companion Animal Group ("CAG") provides in-clinic laboratory analyzers for companion animals. Analyzers measure blood cell counts as well as levels of certain enzymes in blood or urine for the purpose of monitoring health conditions. Major products of this segment are the Catalyst Dx Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest Chemistry Analyzer, Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA),[4] ProCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer, the IDEXX VetAutoread Hematology Analyzer, the SNAP Pro analyzer, and so on, among other laboratory equipment and analytical services. Other areas of the CAG division are centered on diagnostic imaging and veterinary practice management software systems, including the flagship program Cornerstone, as well as DVMax (acquired from Sneakers Software, Inc., a New York City-based company, under terms of Ch. 11 reorganization [1]) in late 2012 [2]) and several legacy practice management software systems.
Water testing[edit]
The Water segment provides products to measure microbiological parameters in water. Products of this segment include the Colilert, Colilert-18, and Colisure tests. Water products are sold in over 120 countries around the globe.[5]
Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics[edit]
The Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics division provides products to detect diseases in livestock and poultry. Products of this segment include tests for Avian Infuenza (AI), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease).[6]

IDEXX Laboratories was founded by David Shaw in 1983 with five employees in the Old Port neighborhood of Portland, Maine to respond to a new niche market: the detection of diseases in livestock and poultry animals such as cows, pigs and chickens. Within a few years, the company distinguished itself as a leader in immunoassay kits, including the now industry-renowned SNAP® family of tests that detect diseases in animals.By 1991, IDEXX had become a publicly traded company and over the next 25 years grew to become a world leader in veterinary diagnostic instrument development and manufacture, reference laboratory services, and dairy and water testing. Put simply, the company keeps animals healthy, and keeps milk and water safe. Today the company headquarters are located in Westbrook, Maine, where it continues to thrive.IDEXX provides diagnostic, pregnancy, and dairy tests for managing herd health and productivity. Producers, laboratories, and veterinarians around the world depend on IDEXX diagnostic tests and technologies to make confident decisions about herd health. IDEXX pregnancy tests provide accurate results as early as 28 days whether you're testing serum, plasma or milk samples. IDEXX Dairy tests detect antibiotic residue and other contaminants in milk.

Blog: The pulse of veterinary medicine
Hook ’em, round ’em, whip ’em: Detect more, detect earlier with Fecal Dx testingInnovations in veterinary medicine continue to make it easier to provide patients with an increasingly higher standard of care. Just like the detection of antigens modernized heartworm testing 20 years ago, fecal antigen testing is now dramatically improving veterinarians’ ability to detect the most common intestinal worms found in dogs and cats.
Think your patients aren’t exposed to leptospirosis? Think again.Any pet that drinks water from puddles risks contracting leptospirosis. The number of cases of leptospirosis is rising in urban and rural communities, even in dry climates. Here’s what you need to know to protect your patients and clients. 
Did you know artificial intelligence is in veterinary medicine?The phrase “artificial intelligence” is everywhere these days. But do you know what it means? And did you know that artificial intelligence is alive and well in many veterinary practices, helping you make more confident and accurate medical decisions?
Coming to your doorstep: one more way to improve practice efficiencyFor more than 25 years, veterinarians like you have counted on SNAP tests to deliver quick, accurate results for a variety of common diseases and conditions. And now we have found a way to make including them in your work flow even easier.
