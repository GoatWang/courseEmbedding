Rho Capital Partners


Rho Capital Partners is the parent company to Rho’s four operating divisions, Rho Ventures, Rho Canada Ventures, Rho Fund Investors and Rho Acceleration. Founded in 1981, Rho began its private equity activities as a family investment office. Today, Rho is a leading private equity firm that manages a series of funds, under each of its four divisions, backed by a broad group of institutional investors that include endowments, foundations, families, pension funds, and other financial institutions. Across all of Rho’s activities and strategies, our teams are committed to investing in growth and building companies over the long-term.

Rho Capital Partners


Rho Capital Partners is the parent company to Rho’s four operating divisions, Rho Ventures, Rho Canada Ventures, Rho Fund Investors and Rho Acceleration. Founded in 1981, Rho began its private equity activities as a family investment office. Today, Rho is a leading private equity firm that manages a series of funds, under each of its four divisions, backed by a broad group of institutional investors that include endowments, foundations, families, pension funds, and other financial institutions. Across all of Rho’s activities and strategies, our teams are committed to investing in growth and building companies over the long-term.
