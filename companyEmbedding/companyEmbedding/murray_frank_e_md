There's an old adage that says if you give children two things - roots and wings - you've given them all the tools they need to successfully make their way the rest of their lives.
 
It may seem like a stretch, but in a way that describes important themes that have run through the life and medical career of Frank Murray, MD '60, a retired internist with modest Wisconsin beginnings who eventually directed medical care at the massive Kaiser Permanente of Southern California.
 
Growing up in the rural town of Montfort, Wisconsin, Murray was thrilled to be able to see far beyond the local farmlands and "fly to the moon and stars" after he got his first telescope at age 8.
 
The seeds of wonderment about science were planted while the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health graduate was a boy and later a student. But other serendipitous guideposts along the way also fueled his distinguished medical career and his life-long interest in astronomy.
 
Telescopes Trained
 
Today, Murray, who resides in the San Bernardino Mountains at Big Bear Lake, California, is living a life that some might say is aimed at the North Star. With his home situated at an altitude of around 7,000 feet, Murray is closer than ever to the stars.
 
Conveniently situated nearby, the Big Bear Discovery Center provides access to three powerful telescopes - one of which is Murray's.
 
As a volunteer at the center, he is there often, advancing the education of visitors from near and far through very popular "star-gazing parties."
 
With the help of the telescopes, he wows schoolchildren and adults alike with insightful presentations on astronomy. Groups have varied in size from 50 to 500.
 
"In 2003, when the orbits of Earth and Mars were closer together than anytime in about 60,000 years, the parking lot was packed," he says.
 
Murray particularly enjoys educating young minds.
 
"We talk about things such as the Big Bang Theory and what galaxies are all about," he says.
 
Reunions Count
 
In April, Murray was in Wisconsin to reconnect with his medical school roots - for the 50th anniversary of his School of Medicine and Public Health Class of 1960 graduation. As the class representative, he had been very busy behind the scenes, heading the reunion's organizational efforts.
 
"I called many classmates and encouraged them to attend the event at the Madison Club," he says. "Dick Normington traveled the farthest - all the way from Australia."
 
While he was in Wisconsin, Murray also reconnected with his friend and mentor, Gabriele M. ZuRhein, MD, a professor emeritus of pathology and laboratory medicine at the School of Medicine and Public Health. She celebrated her 90th birthday on April 6, 2010, and Murray made sure to join the festivities.
 
"She was my escort at graduation, when I received my medical degree, and through the years we have kept in touch," Murray says, adding that he conducted award-winning research with ZuRhein as a medical student.
 
Murray remains close to the members of his Montfort High School class as well. In fact, the Class of 1948 held its 62nd high school reunion this spring-and Murray made a point to be there.
 
Of the 21 members of the class, 12 surviving alums have maintained a strong bond. Unlike some classes that get together every decade or so, this close-knit group gathers every five years.
 
Fated for Medicine
 
Murray's father, who didn't have a university degree, strongly encouraged his three children to go to college. He thought his eldest son would make a good lawyer, engineer or doctor.
 
"I may have disappointed my dad when I said none of those professions intrigued me, but I was interested in science and math," Murray says.
 
He won a scholarship to UW-Madison and in 1952 earned a bachelor's degree in psychology.
 
A curious turn of events occurred when he joined the U.S Army. During his second week of basic training, the master sergeant asked if anyone knew how to type.
 
Among the few people to raise their hands, Murray was chosen to work as the company clerk. Later he was transferred to a medical unit and sent to the University of Louisville to train as an EEG technician.
 
Working in that role brought the possibility of a future in medicine ever closer to reality.
 
"The opportunity linked my natural interest in science to the world of medicine," Murray says.
 
It also fueled his deep curiosity about how things work and his interest in problem solving.
 
"I began hanging around the emergency room at the university hospital there," he says. "I thought, 'This is really interesting, maybe I should go to medical school.'"
 
So in 1956, as his destiny played out, Murray entered medical school at UW-Madison.
 
"I look back on those years now as being among the happiest experiences in my life," he says. "I thought to myself, 'This is heaven.' At medical school they were teaching us such interesting things."
 
Murray and his wife, Ione, were happy at home as well. They welcomed the birth of the first of their six children during those medical school days.
 
"I'll never forget the timing of the birth. He was born right before I took my first gross anatomy class exam," Murray says, adding that a second child was born before he graduated from medical school.
 
Passion for Work
 
After finishing his residency in 1964, Murray joined Einar Daniels, MD '34, and others in a small internal medicine group in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where he practiced for about 10 years.
 
"It was very rewarding to get to know patients in many ways beyond what they had come to see me for," he says.
 
But a trip to a critical-care medicine conference in California in 1971 took Murray in an entirely different direction. He was offered a job at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Harbor City outside Los Angeles.
 
Eight years later, with training in the Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program under his belt, Murray was appointed medical director of Kaiser Permanente of Southern California. One of the largest and oldest health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the country, Kaiser Permanente combined health plans, hospitals and medical groups in a highly complex relationship.
 
Murray's job entailed overseeing 50 medical offices and about 50,000 employees.
 
During his 12-year tenure as medical director, he helped usher in the use of nurse practitioners, evidence-based medicine and electronic medical records well in advance of most of the rest of the country.
 
"I think one of my major contributions to Kaiser Permanente was to formalize the business administrative structure of the organization," he says. "I thought more about those kinds of things than the things doctors are generally most interested in - which is patient care."
 
Another key accomplishment had to do with quality assurance for HMOs.
 
"I worked with the medical director of the Harvard Community Health Plan and the CEO of Henry Ford Hospital System in Detroit to create the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a Washington, DC-based accrediting agency related to quality issues in HMOs," he says.
 
Murray stayed with Kaiser Permanente until his retirement in 1993, and then served in a national leadership role in the organization's Atlanta offices for an additional two years.
 
Back to the Stars
 
Post-retirement, Murray returned to his love of astronomy. He even seriously contemplated pursuing a PhD in astrophysics at the University of Arizona. Instead, the Murrays decided to move to Big Bear Lake, where they have breathtaking views of the western skies.
 
"It's interesting how things guide you down a path in life," says Murray. "If I hadn't been in the military or raised my hand and said I could type, I might not have become a doctor or medical director."
 
And if he hadn't received a telescope as an 8-year-old, he might not be illuminating the minds of budding astronomy fans in California today.
 
It's all written in the stars, or so they say.

We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Murray has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for California.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Murray's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.

					Yard Doctor				

					If you’ve ever owned a Murray product, you’ll understand why they  continue growing into one of the largest power equipment companies in the world. Simply put, their machines get the job done, no matter how tough it is. 

Their association with Briggs and Stratton makes their quality unmatched. So if you’re sick of spending hours shoveling snow or pushing a lawnmower, upgrade with a Murray and see why they are the choice for so many professionals.
