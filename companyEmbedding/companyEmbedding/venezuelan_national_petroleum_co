Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter.
Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world, and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. The government of Venezuela treats PDVSA as a cash-cow,[3] and the company only hires political supporters of the president.[4] Between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to the government's social development projects. Around half of this went directly to various Bolivarian Missions, with the remainder distributed via the National Development Fund.[5] Incompetence has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents.[6]

Venezuela has 77.5 billion barrels (1.232×1010 m3) of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated 235 billion barrels (3.74×1010 m3) of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has 150 trillion cubic feet (4.2×1012 m3) of natural gas reserves.
PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of 4 million barrels (640,000 m3) per day (600,000 m³). Officials say production is around 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m3/d) although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d) lower.
Politicization[edit]
In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami".[7]
PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects.[8]
History[edit]
1980s/1990s[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


PDVSA purchased 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remainder in 1990.[9]
2000s[edit]




Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA)


In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for 2 months. 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed without compensation, and the government eventually reestablished production with employees loyal to the elected government.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch "an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture", surrounding this strike.[2] The strike caused substantial macroeconomic damage, pushing unemployment up by 5% to a peak of over 20% in March 2003.[3] The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential "coup" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's "socialist revolution".[10]
In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58.[4]
In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.
In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price.[5] Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.
In February 2006 PDVSA completed ISO 9001:2000 process certification for its distribution system.[6]
On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).[1]
PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.[11]
PDVSA is Latin America's third-largest company, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.[12]
2010s[edit]
In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd.[13]
In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas.[14] In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture.[15] In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.[16]
Following the death of Chávez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly.[17] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[18]
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.[19]
Nationalization[edit]
Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976, and along with it came the birth of PDVSA. See: History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Nationalization
Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total. Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retain minority interests in their Venezuelan projects.[20] Arriving at a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult with Venezuela offering book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asking for as much as $12 billion. This and a number of other matters including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.[21] PDVSA has paid compensation for assets it has nationalized including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.[22]
Safety[edit]
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003,[4] culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes.[23] Another major fire broke out at the El Palito refinery in September 2012.[24]

Venezuela's historic inflation rate beside annual oil revenues.[1][2][3][4][5]



The Real and Nominal price of oil from 1861 to 2015.



Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated 296.5 billion barrels (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
In 2008, crude oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and the country was also the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world. Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).[6]

Pre-discovery[edit]
Indigenous usage[edit]
The Indigenous peoples in Venezuela, like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps, which ooze through the ground to the surface, in the years before the Spanish conquistadors. The thick black liquid, known to the locals as mene, was primarily used for medical purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.[7]
Spanish acquisition[edit]
Upon arrival in the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well, and for treating their weapons. The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.[7]
1908–1940[edit]




Juan Vicente Gómez






Ancient office of Mene Grande Oil Company


Despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them.[8] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the Zumaque-I (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, Mene Grande, was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin.[7] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to "invade" Venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action.
From 1914 to 1917, several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared for the first time on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.[7]
It was the blowout of the Barroso No. 2 well in Cabimas in 1922[9] that marked the beginning of Venezuela's modern history as a major producer. This discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world. Soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich, and by 1928 Venezuela became the world's leading oil exporter.[10] Oil ended Venezuela's relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers, making it a linchpin of an ever-expanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking.[10] Venezuela's oil production became a major factor in policy making in Washington before the Second World War.[10]
Cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nation's largest oil fields, which are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo. Other fields are increasing in importance, mainly in eastern Venezuela.[11] About twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill, Venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and, after the United States, the second largest oil producer. Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935.[12] By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.[13]
First Dutch Disease[edit]
By 1929, the dramatic development of the Venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country, however, agricultural production began to decrease dramatically.[14][15] This sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the Venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the Dutch Disease. This "disease" occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy, causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors.[14]
Agriculture accounted for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countries.[citation needed]
Xenophobia[edit]
With a large influx of foreign "invaders", the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent. Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:

One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. They drew something (on a piece of paper) and opened their way through the forest. Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.

Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:

The workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond, blue-eyed men who own millions of dollars, pounds and gulden in European and U.S. banks, refused.

Venezuela production of crude oil, 1950-2012


In 1941, Isaías Medina Angarita, a former army general from the Venezuelan Andes, was indirectly elected president. One of his most important reforms during his tenure was the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Law of 1943. This new law was the first major political step taken toward gaining more government control over its oil industry. Under the new law, the government took 50% of profits.[8][16] Once passed, this piece of legislation basically remained unchanged until 1976, the year of nationalization, with only two partial revisions being made in 1955 and 1967.[citation needed]
In 1944, the Venezuelan government granted several new concessions encouraging the discovery of even more oil fields. This was mostly attributed to an increase in oil demand caused by an ongoing World War II, and by 1945, Venezuela was producing close to 1 million barrels per day (160,000 m3/d).
Being an avid supplier of petroleum to the Allies of World War II, Venezuela had increased its production by 42 percent from 1943-44 alone.[17] Even after the war, oil demand continued to rise due to the fact that there was an increase from twenty-six million to forty million cars in service in the United States from 1945 to 1950.[18]
By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern countries had started contributing significant amounts of oil to the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas. The world experienced an over-supply of oil, and prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Creation of OPEC[edit]

Main article: OPEC




OPEC countries


In response to the chronically low oil prices of the mid and late 1950s, oil producing countries Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait met in Baghdad in September 1960 to form the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The main goal of the OPEC member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations. This was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale.
Oil embargo of 1973[edit]
Main article: 1973 oil crisis
In the early 1970s, oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation. In 1972 they rapidly obtained a 25 percent participation, and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to 60 percent participation in the ownership of the companies.[8] By 1973, OPEC Persian Gulf states members decided to raise their prices by 70 percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to Israel (the United States and the Netherlands). This event became known as the 1973 oil crisis. Following a culmination of conflicts in the Middle East and the oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf no longer exporting to the United States and oil prices rising steeply, Venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits. Between 1972 and 1974, the Venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled.[14] With a new sense of confidence, Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez pledged that Venezuela would develop significantly within a few years.[14] By substituting imports, subsidies, and protective tariffs, he planned to use oil profits to increase employment, fight poverty, increase income, and diversify the economy. However, OPEC members had been violating production quotas, and oil prices fell drastically again in the 1980s, pushing Venezuela deeper into debt.
Nationalization[edit]




Petroleum map of Venezuela, 1972


Well before 1976, Venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession.[8] The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.[8]
Nationalization become official when the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, "La Gran Venezuela", called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution. The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies. Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC)-predecessor.[19]
All the new companies are owned by a holding company-Petroven or PDV- and in its turned owned by the State.[20] Ultimately not much had changed in this regard, as all Venezuelans with leading positions in the MNCs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies,[20] and therefore still securing their interests in Venezuela's oil. PDVSA controls activity involving oil and natural gas in Venezuela. In 1980, in an aggressive internationalization plan, PDVSA bought refineries in USA and Europe as the American Citgo that catapultated it to the third-largest oil company in the world.[14]
1977–1998[edit]
After the 1973 oil crisis, the brief period of economic prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short lived. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."[21] This was the case during the "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Second Dutch Disease[edit]
During the mid-1980s, Venezuela's oil production steadily began to rise.[22] By the 1990s, symptoms of the Dutch Disease were once again becoming apparent. Between 1990-99, Venezuela's industrial production declined from 50 percent to 24 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared to a decrease of 36 percent to 29 percent for the rest of Latin America,[23] but production levels continued to rise until 1998.[22]
However, the efficiency of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving a remainder of 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving a remainder of only 36 percent for the government.[24]
1999–present[edit]




Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.




"There is no question that Venezuela under Chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world."

Foreign Policy[25]
After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total. Chávez’s policies damaged Venezuela's oil industry due to lack of investment, corruption and cash shortages.[26][27]
The Chávez government used PDVSA resources to fund social programmes, treating it like a "piggybank",[28] and PDVSA staff were required to support Chávez. His social policies resulted in overspending[25][29][30] that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.[31][32][33]
According to Corrales and Penfold, "Chávez was not the first president in Venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil, but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.[34]
Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued much of the policies created by Chávez, with Venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies.[25][29][30][35]
Reinforcement of OPEC[edit]
At the time of Chávez's election, OPEC had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created. A combination of OPEC members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state of OPEC in 25 years (the second ever).[14] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.[citation needed]
The meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but much of that is also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.[36]
Enabling act laws and controversy[edit]

Bolivarian propaganda supporting Chávez on the PDVSA Towers in Maracaibo.


In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted Chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions.[37] On 13 November 2001 while ruling by decree, Chávez enacted the new Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.[37] The laws "marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes.[38] For the opposition to Chávez, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a "dictator-in-training".[37]
Chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas, such as ten percent of PDVSA’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs.[39] He also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process.[14] Chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over PDVSA and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over PDVSA’s small revenue contributions to the government. By 2002, warnings grew of the Chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support.[40]
In December 2002, PDVSA officially went on strike creating a near-complete halt on oil production in Venezuela. The aim of the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 was to pressure Chávez into resigning and calling early elections. The strike lasted approximately two months, and the government ended up firing 19,000 PDVSA employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the Chávez government.[41] By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.[37] In April 2002, mass demonstrations occurred in Caracas and Chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
A few months after the failure of the coup and the return of Chavez, a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an "indefinite national strike" which, in many places, turned out to be a forced "bosses lock out" where the employees were prevented from working.[citation needed] When the strike ended, substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by 5 percent. This increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over 20 percent in March 2003.[42]
Following the strikes, Chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as "re-nationalization". He aimed at improving the efficiency of PDVSA in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation. Certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in Chávez's first term.[14] By 2006, the government had a 40 percent share, which was announced to be increased by 20 percent.[citation needed]
International deals[edit]
In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region. Chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more Venezuelan oil to China so his country can become more independent of the United States. The United States currently accounts for 65 percent of Venezuela's exports.[43]
In 2007, Chávez struck a deal with Brazilian oil company Petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil where crude oil will be sent from both Brazil and Argentina. A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine 100,000 barrels (16,000 m3) of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.[citation needed]
Third Dutch Disease[edit]




Shortages leave shelves empty in this Venezuelan store.


The Chávez administration used high oil prices in the 2000s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters.[25][40] The social works initiated by Chávez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, with Chávez's administration suffering from Dutch disease as a result.[25][44]




Shortages of gasoline in Venezuela in March 2017


According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";[45] oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 [...] to 89% in 2006";[45] and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".[45] By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed"[25] and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[46]
Economists say that the Venezuelan government's overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the country's economy, contributing to rising inflation, poverty, low healthcare spending and shortages in Venezuela going into the final years of his presidency.[25][29][30][35][40][47]
According to analysts, the economic woes Venezuela suffered under President Nicolás Maduro would have still occurred with or without Chávez.[48] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[49]

Venezuela's historic inflation rate beside annual oil revenues.[1][2][3][4][5]



The Real and Nominal price of oil from 1861 to 2015.



Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated 296.5 billion barrels (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
In 2008, crude oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and the country was also the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world. Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).[6]

Pre-discovery[edit]
Indigenous usage[edit]
The Indigenous peoples in Venezuela, like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps, which ooze through the ground to the surface, in the years before the Spanish conquistadors. The thick black liquid, known to the locals as mene, was primarily used for medical purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.[7]
Spanish acquisition[edit]
Upon arrival in the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well, and for treating their weapons. The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.[7]
1908–1940[edit]




Juan Vicente Gómez






Ancient office of Mene Grande Oil Company


Despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them.[8] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the Zumaque-I (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, Mene Grande, was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin.[7] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to "invade" Venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action.
From 1914 to 1917, several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared for the first time on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.[7]
It was the blowout of the Barroso No. 2 well in Cabimas in 1922[9] that marked the beginning of Venezuela's modern history as a major producer. This discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world. Soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich, and by 1928 Venezuela became the world's leading oil exporter.[10] Oil ended Venezuela's relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers, making it a linchpin of an ever-expanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking.[10] Venezuela's oil production became a major factor in policy making in Washington before the Second World War.[10]
Cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nation's largest oil fields, which are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo. Other fields are increasing in importance, mainly in eastern Venezuela.[11] About twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill, Venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and, after the United States, the second largest oil producer. Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935.[12] By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.[13]
First Dutch Disease[edit]
By 1929, the dramatic development of the Venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country, however, agricultural production began to decrease dramatically.[14][15] This sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the Venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the Dutch Disease. This "disease" occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy, causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors.[14]
Agriculture accounted for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countries.[citation needed]
Xenophobia[edit]
With a large influx of foreign "invaders", the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent. Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:

One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. They drew something (on a piece of paper) and opened their way through the forest. Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.

Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:

The workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond, blue-eyed men who own millions of dollars, pounds and gulden in European and U.S. banks, refused.

Venezuela production of crude oil, 1950-2012


In 1941, Isaías Medina Angarita, a former army general from the Venezuelan Andes, was indirectly elected president. One of his most important reforms during his tenure was the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Law of 1943. This new law was the first major political step taken toward gaining more government control over its oil industry. Under the new law, the government took 50% of profits.[8][16] Once passed, this piece of legislation basically remained unchanged until 1976, the year of nationalization, with only two partial revisions being made in 1955 and 1967.[citation needed]
In 1944, the Venezuelan government granted several new concessions encouraging the discovery of even more oil fields. This was mostly attributed to an increase in oil demand caused by an ongoing World War II, and by 1945, Venezuela was producing close to 1 million barrels per day (160,000 m3/d).
Being an avid supplier of petroleum to the Allies of World War II, Venezuela had increased its production by 42 percent from 1943-44 alone.[17] Even after the war, oil demand continued to rise due to the fact that there was an increase from twenty-six million to forty million cars in service in the United States from 1945 to 1950.[18]
By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern countries had started contributing significant amounts of oil to the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas. The world experienced an over-supply of oil, and prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Creation of OPEC[edit]

Main article: OPEC




OPEC countries


In response to the chronically low oil prices of the mid and late 1950s, oil producing countries Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait met in Baghdad in September 1960 to form the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The main goal of the OPEC member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations. This was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale.
Oil embargo of 1973[edit]
Main article: 1973 oil crisis
In the early 1970s, oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation. In 1972 they rapidly obtained a 25 percent participation, and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to 60 percent participation in the ownership of the companies.[8] By 1973, OPEC Persian Gulf states members decided to raise their prices by 70 percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to Israel (the United States and the Netherlands). This event became known as the 1973 oil crisis. Following a culmination of conflicts in the Middle East and the oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf no longer exporting to the United States and oil prices rising steeply, Venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits. Between 1972 and 1974, the Venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled.[14] With a new sense of confidence, Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez pledged that Venezuela would develop significantly within a few years.[14] By substituting imports, subsidies, and protective tariffs, he planned to use oil profits to increase employment, fight poverty, increase income, and diversify the economy. However, OPEC members had been violating production quotas, and oil prices fell drastically again in the 1980s, pushing Venezuela deeper into debt.
Nationalization[edit]




Petroleum map of Venezuela, 1972


Well before 1976, Venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession.[8] The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.[8]
Nationalization become official when the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, "La Gran Venezuela", called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution. The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies. Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC)-predecessor.[19]
All the new companies are owned by a holding company-Petroven or PDV- and in its turned owned by the State.[20] Ultimately not much had changed in this regard, as all Venezuelans with leading positions in the MNCs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies,[20] and therefore still securing their interests in Venezuela's oil. PDVSA controls activity involving oil and natural gas in Venezuela. In 1980, in an aggressive internationalization plan, PDVSA bought refineries in USA and Europe as the American Citgo that catapultated it to the third-largest oil company in the world.[14]
1977–1998[edit]
After the 1973 oil crisis, the brief period of economic prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short lived. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."[21] This was the case during the "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Second Dutch Disease[edit]
During the mid-1980s, Venezuela's oil production steadily began to rise.[22] By the 1990s, symptoms of the Dutch Disease were once again becoming apparent. Between 1990-99, Venezuela's industrial production declined from 50 percent to 24 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared to a decrease of 36 percent to 29 percent for the rest of Latin America,[23] but production levels continued to rise until 1998.[22]
However, the efficiency of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving a remainder of 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving a remainder of only 36 percent for the government.[24]
1999–present[edit]




Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.




"There is no question that Venezuela under Chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world."

Foreign Policy[25]
After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total. Chávez’s policies damaged Venezuela's oil industry due to lack of investment, corruption and cash shortages.[26][27]
The Chávez government used PDVSA resources to fund social programmes, treating it like a "piggybank",[28] and PDVSA staff were required to support Chávez. His social policies resulted in overspending[25][29][30] that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.[31][32][33]
According to Corrales and Penfold, "Chávez was not the first president in Venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil, but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.[34]
Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued much of the policies created by Chávez, with Venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies.[25][29][30][35]
Reinforcement of OPEC[edit]
At the time of Chávez's election, OPEC had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created. A combination of OPEC members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state of OPEC in 25 years (the second ever).[14] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.[citation needed]
The meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but much of that is also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.[36]
Enabling act laws and controversy[edit]

Bolivarian propaganda supporting Chávez on the PDVSA Towers in Maracaibo.


In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted Chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions.[37] On 13 November 2001 while ruling by decree, Chávez enacted the new Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.[37] The laws "marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes.[38] For the opposition to Chávez, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a "dictator-in-training".[37]
Chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas, such as ten percent of PDVSA’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs.[39] He also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process.[14] Chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over PDVSA and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over PDVSA’s small revenue contributions to the government. By 2002, warnings grew of the Chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support.[40]
In December 2002, PDVSA officially went on strike creating a near-complete halt on oil production in Venezuela. The aim of the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 was to pressure Chávez into resigning and calling early elections. The strike lasted approximately two months, and the government ended up firing 19,000 PDVSA employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the Chávez government.[41] By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.[37] In April 2002, mass demonstrations occurred in Caracas and Chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
A few months after the failure of the coup and the return of Chavez, a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an "indefinite national strike" which, in many places, turned out to be a forced "bosses lock out" where the employees were prevented from working.[citation needed] When the strike ended, substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by 5 percent. This increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over 20 percent in March 2003.[42]
Following the strikes, Chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as "re-nationalization". He aimed at improving the efficiency of PDVSA in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation. Certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in Chávez's first term.[14] By 2006, the government had a 40 percent share, which was announced to be increased by 20 percent.[citation needed]
International deals[edit]
In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region. Chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more Venezuelan oil to China so his country can become more independent of the United States. The United States currently accounts for 65 percent of Venezuela's exports.[43]
In 2007, Chávez struck a deal with Brazilian oil company Petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil where crude oil will be sent from both Brazil and Argentina. A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine 100,000 barrels (16,000 m3) of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.[citation needed]
Third Dutch Disease[edit]




Shortages leave shelves empty in this Venezuelan store.


The Chávez administration used high oil prices in the 2000s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters.[25][40] The social works initiated by Chávez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, with Chávez's administration suffering from Dutch disease as a result.[25][44]




Shortages of gasoline in Venezuela in March 2017


According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";[45] oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 [...] to 89% in 2006";[45] and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".[45] By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed"[25] and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[46]
Economists say that the Venezuelan government's overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the country's economy, contributing to rising inflation, poverty, low healthcare spending and shortages in Venezuela going into the final years of his presidency.[25][29][30][35][40][47]
According to analysts, the economic woes Venezuela suffered under President Nicolás Maduro would have still occurred with or without Chávez.[48] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[49]

Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter.
Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world, and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. The government of Venezuela treats PDVSA as a cash-cow,[3] and the company only hires political supporters of the president.[4] Between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to the government's social development projects. Around half of this went directly to various Bolivarian Missions, with the remainder distributed via the National Development Fund.[5] Incompetence has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents.[6]

Venezuela has 77.5 billion barrels (1.232×1010 m3) of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated 235 billion barrels (3.74×1010 m3) of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has 150 trillion cubic feet (4.2×1012 m3) of natural gas reserves.
PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of 4 million barrels (640,000 m3) per day (600,000 m³). Officials say production is around 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m3/d) although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d) lower.
Politicization[edit]
In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami".[7]
PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects.[8]

PDVSA purchased 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remainder in 1990.[9]
2000s[edit]




Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA)


In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for 2 months. 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed without compensation, and the government eventually reestablished production with employees loyal to the elected government.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch "an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture", surrounding this strike.[2] The strike caused substantial macroeconomic damage, pushing unemployment up by 5% to a peak of over 20% in March 2003.[3] The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential "coup" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's "socialist revolution".[10]
In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58.[4]
In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.
In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price.[5] Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.
In February 2006 PDVSA completed ISO 9001:2000 process certification for its distribution system.[6]
On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).[1]
PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.[11]
PDVSA is Latin America's third-largest company, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.[12]
2010s[edit]
In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd.[13]
In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas.[14] In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture.[15] In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.[16]
Following the death of Chávez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly.[17] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[18]
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.[19]
Nationalization[edit]
Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976, and along with it came the birth of PDVSA. See: History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Nationalization
Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total. Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retain minority interests in their Venezuelan projects.[20] Arriving at a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult with Venezuela offering book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asking for as much as $12 billion. This and a number of other matters including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.[21] PDVSA has paid compensation for assets it has nationalized including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.[22]
Safety[edit]
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003,[4] culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes.[23] Another major fire broke out at the El Palito refinery in September 2012.[24]

Venezuela's historic inflation rate beside annual oil revenues.[1][2][3][4][5]



The Real and Nominal price of oil from 1861 to 2015.



Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated 296.5 billion barrels (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
In 2008, crude oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and the country was also the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world. Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).[6]

Pre-discovery[edit]
Indigenous usage[edit]
The Indigenous peoples in Venezuela, like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps, which ooze through the ground to the surface, in the years before the Spanish conquistadors. The thick black liquid, known to the locals as mene, was primarily used for medical purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.[7]
Spanish acquisition[edit]
Upon arrival in the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well, and for treating their weapons. The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.[7]
1908–1940[edit]




Juan Vicente Gómez






Ancient office of Mene Grande Oil Company


Despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them.[8] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the Zumaque-I (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, Mene Grande, was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin.[7] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to "invade" Venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action.
From 1914 to 1917, several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared for the first time on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.[7]
It was the blowout of the Barroso No. 2 well in Cabimas in 1922[9] that marked the beginning of Venezuela's modern history as a major producer. This discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world. Soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich, and by 1928 Venezuela became the world's leading oil exporter.[10] Oil ended Venezuela's relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers, making it a linchpin of an ever-expanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking.[10] Venezuela's oil production became a major factor in policy making in Washington before the Second World War.[10]
Cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nation's largest oil fields, which are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo. Other fields are increasing in importance, mainly in eastern Venezuela.[11] About twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill, Venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and, after the United States, the second largest oil producer. Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935.[12] By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.[13]
First Dutch Disease[edit]
By 1929, the dramatic development of the Venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country, however, agricultural production began to decrease dramatically.[14][15] This sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the Venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the Dutch Disease. This "disease" occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy, causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors.[14]
Agriculture accounted for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countries.[citation needed]
Xenophobia[edit]
With a large influx of foreign "invaders", the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent. Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:

One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. They drew something (on a piece of paper) and opened their way through the forest. Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.

Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:

The workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond, blue-eyed men who own millions of dollars, pounds and gulden in European and U.S. banks, refused.

1940–1976[edit]

Venezuela production of crude oil, 1950-2012


In 1941, Isaías Medina Angarita, a former army general from the Venezuelan Andes, was indirectly elected president. One of his most important reforms during his tenure was the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Law of 1943. This new law was the first major political step taken toward gaining more government control over its oil industry. Under the new law, the government took 50% of profits.[8][16] Once passed, this piece of legislation basically remained unchanged until 1976, the year of nationalization, with only two partial revisions being made in 1955 and 1967.[citation needed]
In 1944, the Venezuelan government granted several new concessions encouraging the discovery of even more oil fields. This was mostly attributed to an increase in oil demand caused by an ongoing World War II, and by 1945, Venezuela was producing close to 1 million barrels per day (160,000 m3/d).
Being an avid supplier of petroleum to the Allies of World War II, Venezuela had increased its production by 42 percent from 1943-44 alone.[17] Even after the war, oil demand continued to rise due to the fact that there was an increase from twenty-six million to forty million cars in service in the United States from 1945 to 1950.[18]
By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern countries had started contributing significant amounts of oil to the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas. The world experienced an over-supply of oil, and prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Creation of OPEC[edit]

Main article: OPEC




OPEC countries


In response to the chronically low oil prices of the mid and late 1950s, oil producing countries Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait met in Baghdad in September 1960 to form the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The main goal of the OPEC member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations. This was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale.
Oil embargo of 1973[edit]
Main article: 1973 oil crisis
In the early 1970s, oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation. In 1972 they rapidly obtained a 25 percent participation, and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to 60 percent participation in the ownership of the companies.[8] By 1973, OPEC Persian Gulf states members decided to raise their prices by 70 percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to Israel (the United States and the Netherlands). This event became known as the 1973 oil crisis. Following a culmination of conflicts in the Middle East and the oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf no longer exporting to the United States and oil prices rising steeply, Venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits. Between 1972 and 1974, the Venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled.[14] With a new sense of confidence, Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez pledged that Venezuela would develop significantly within a few years.[14] By substituting imports, subsidies, and protective tariffs, he planned to use oil profits to increase employment, fight poverty, increase income, and diversify the economy. However, OPEC members had been violating production quotas, and oil prices fell drastically again in the 1980s, pushing Venezuela deeper into debt.
Nationalization[edit]




Petroleum map of Venezuela, 1972


Well before 1976, Venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession.[8] The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.[8]
Nationalization become official when the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, "La Gran Venezuela", called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution. The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies. Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC)-predecessor.[19]
All the new companies are owned by a holding company-Petroven or PDV- and in its turned owned by the State.[20] Ultimately not much had changed in this regard, as all Venezuelans with leading positions in the MNCs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies,[20] and therefore still securing their interests in Venezuela's oil. PDVSA controls activity involving oil and natural gas in Venezuela. In 1980, in an aggressive internationalization plan, PDVSA bought refineries in USA and Europe as the American Citgo that catapultated it to the third-largest oil company in the world.[14]
1977–1998[edit]
After the 1973 oil crisis, the brief period of economic prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short lived. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."[21] This was the case during the "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Second Dutch Disease[edit]
During the mid-1980s, Venezuela's oil production steadily began to rise.[22] By the 1990s, symptoms of the Dutch Disease were once again becoming apparent. Between 1990-99, Venezuela's industrial production declined from 50 percent to 24 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared to a decrease of 36 percent to 29 percent for the rest of Latin America,[23] but production levels continued to rise until 1998.[22]
However, the efficiency of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving a remainder of 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving a remainder of only 36 percent for the government.[24]
1999–present[edit]




Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.




"There is no question that Venezuela under Chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world."

Foreign Policy[25]
After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total. Chávez’s policies damaged Venezuela's oil industry due to lack of investment, corruption and cash shortages.[26][27]
The Chávez government used PDVSA resources to fund social programmes, treating it like a "piggybank",[28] and PDVSA staff were required to support Chávez. His social policies resulted in overspending[25][29][30] that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.[31][32][33]
According to Corrales and Penfold, "Chávez was not the first president in Venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil, but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.[34]
Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued much of the policies created by Chávez, with Venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies.[25][29][30][35]
Reinforcement of OPEC[edit]
At the time of Chávez's election, OPEC had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created. A combination of OPEC members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state of OPEC in 25 years (the second ever).[14] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.[citation needed]
The meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but much of that is also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.[36]
Enabling act laws and controversy[edit]

Bolivarian propaganda supporting Chávez on the PDVSA Towers in Maracaibo.


In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted Chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions.[37] On 13 November 2001 while ruling by decree, Chávez enacted the new Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.[37] The laws "marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes.[38] For the opposition to Chávez, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a "dictator-in-training".[37]
Chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas, such as ten percent of PDVSA’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs.[39] He also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process.[14] Chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over PDVSA and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over PDVSA’s small revenue contributions to the government. By 2002, warnings grew of the Chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support.[40]
In December 2002, PDVSA officially went on strike creating a near-complete halt on oil production in Venezuela. The aim of the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 was to pressure Chávez into resigning and calling early elections. The strike lasted approximately two months, and the government ended up firing 19,000 PDVSA employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the Chávez government.[41] By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.[37] In April 2002, mass demonstrations occurred in Caracas and Chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
A few months after the failure of the coup and the return of Chavez, a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an "indefinite national strike" which, in many places, turned out to be a forced "bosses lock out" where the employees were prevented from working.[citation needed] When the strike ended, substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by 5 percent. This increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over 20 percent in March 2003.[42]
Following the strikes, Chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as "re-nationalization". He aimed at improving the efficiency of PDVSA in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation. Certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in Chávez's first term.[14] By 2006, the government had a 40 percent share, which was announced to be increased by 20 percent.[citation needed]
International deals[edit]
In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region. Chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more Venezuelan oil to China so his country can become more independent of the United States. The United States currently accounts for 65 percent of Venezuela's exports.[43]
In 2007, Chávez struck a deal with Brazilian oil company Petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil where crude oil will be sent from both Brazil and Argentina. A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine 100,000 barrels (16,000 m3) of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.[citation needed]
Third Dutch Disease[edit]




Shortages leave shelves empty in this Venezuelan store.


The Chávez administration used high oil prices in the 2000s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters.[25][40] The social works initiated by Chávez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, with Chávez's administration suffering from Dutch disease as a result.[25][44]




Shortages of gasoline in Venezuela in March 2017


According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";[45] oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 [...] to 89% in 2006";[45] and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".[45] By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed"[25] and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[46]
Economists say that the Venezuelan government's overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the country's economy, contributing to rising inflation, poverty, low healthcare spending and shortages in Venezuela going into the final years of his presidency.[25][29][30][35][40][47]
According to analysts, the economic woes Venezuela suffered under President Nicolás Maduro would have still occurred with or without Chávez.[48] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[49]

Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter.
Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world, and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. The government of Venezuela treats PDVSA as a cash-cow,[3] and the company only hires political supporters of the president.[4] Between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to the government's social development projects. Around half of this went directly to various Bolivarian Missions, with the remainder distributed via the National Development Fund.[5] Incompetence has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents.[6]

Venezuela has 77.5 billion barrels (1.232×1010 m3) of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated 235 billion barrels (3.74×1010 m3) of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has 150 trillion cubic feet (4.2×1012 m3) of natural gas reserves.
PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of 4 million barrels (640,000 m3) per day (600,000 m³). Officials say production is around 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m3/d) although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d) lower.
Politicization[edit]
In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami".[7]
PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects.[8]

PDVSA purchased 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remainder in 1990.[9]
2000s[edit]




Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA)


In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for 2 months. 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed without compensation, and the government eventually reestablished production with employees loyal to the elected government.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch "an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture", surrounding this strike.[2] The strike caused substantial macroeconomic damage, pushing unemployment up by 5% to a peak of over 20% in March 2003.[3] The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential "coup" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's "socialist revolution".[10]
In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58.[4]
In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.
In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price.[5] Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.
In February 2006 PDVSA completed ISO 9001:2000 process certification for its distribution system.[6]
On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).[1]
PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.[11]
PDVSA is Latin America's third-largest company, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.[12]
2010s[edit]
In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd.[13]
In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas.[14] In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture.[15] In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.[16]
Following the death of Chávez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly.[17] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[18]
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.[19]
Nationalization[edit]
Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976, and along with it came the birth of PDVSA. See: History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Nationalization
Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total. Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retain minority interests in their Venezuelan projects.[20] Arriving at a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult with Venezuela offering book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asking for as much as $12 billion. This and a number of other matters including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.[21] PDVSA has paid compensation for assets it has nationalized including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.[22]
Safety[edit]
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003,[4] culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes.[23] Another major fire broke out at the El Palito refinery in September 2012.[24]

Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter.
Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world, and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. The government of Venezuela treats PDVSA as a cash-cow,[3] and the company only hires political supporters of the president.[4] Between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to the government's social development projects. Around half of this went directly to various Bolivarian Missions, with the remainder distributed via the National Development Fund.[5] Incompetence has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents.[6]

Reserves and capacity[edit]




PDVSA Gas, Isla de Margarita.

Venezuela has 77.5 billion barrels (1.232×1010 m3) of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated 235 billion barrels (3.74×1010 m3) of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has 150 trillion cubic feet (4.2×1012 m3) of natural gas reserves.
PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of 4 million barrels (640,000 m3) per day (600,000 m³). Officials say production is around 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m3/d) although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d) lower.
Politicization[edit]
In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami".[7]
PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects.[8]
History[edit]
1980s/1990s[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


PDVSA purchased 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remainder in 1990.[9]
2000s[edit]




Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA)


In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for 2 months. 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed without compensation, and the government eventually reestablished production with employees loyal to the elected government.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch "an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture", surrounding this strike.[2] The strike caused substantial macroeconomic damage, pushing unemployment up by 5% to a peak of over 20% in March 2003.[3] The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential "coup" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's "socialist revolution".[10]
In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58.[4]
In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.
In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price.[5] Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.
In February 2006 PDVSA completed ISO 9001:2000 process certification for its distribution system.[6]
On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).[1]
PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.[11]
PDVSA is Latin America's third-largest company, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.[12]
2010s[edit]
In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd.[13]
In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas.[14] In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture.[15] In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.[16]
Following the death of Chávez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly.[17] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[18]
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.[19]
Nationalization[edit]
Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976, and along with it came the birth of PDVSA. See: History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Nationalization
Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total. Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retain minority interests in their Venezuelan projects.[20] Arriving at a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult with Venezuela offering book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asking for as much as $12 billion. This and a number of other matters including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.[21] PDVSA has paid compensation for assets it has nationalized including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.[22]
Safety[edit]
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003,[4] culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes.[23] Another major fire broke out at the El Palito refinery in September 2012.[24]

Venezuela's historic inflation rate beside annual oil revenues.[1][2][3][4][5]



The Real and Nominal price of oil from 1861 to 2015.



Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated 296.5 billion barrels (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
In 2008, crude oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and the country was also the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world. Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).[6]

Pre-discovery[edit]
Indigenous usage[edit]
The Indigenous peoples in Venezuela, like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps, which ooze through the ground to the surface, in the years before the Spanish conquistadors. The thick black liquid, known to the locals as mene, was primarily used for medical purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.[7]
Spanish acquisition[edit]
Upon arrival in the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well, and for treating their weapons. The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.[7]
1908–1940[edit]




Juan Vicente Gómez






Ancient office of Mene Grande Oil Company


Despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them.[8] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the Zumaque-I (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, Mene Grande, was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin.[7] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to "invade" Venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action.
From 1914 to 1917, several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared for the first time on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.[7]
It was the blowout of the Barroso No. 2 well in Cabimas in 1922[9] that marked the beginning of Venezuela's modern history as a major producer. This discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world. Soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich, and by 1928 Venezuela became the world's leading oil exporter.[10] Oil ended Venezuela's relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers, making it a linchpin of an ever-expanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking.[10] Venezuela's oil production became a major factor in policy making in Washington before the Second World War.[10]
Cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nation's largest oil fields, which are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo. Other fields are increasing in importance, mainly in eastern Venezuela.[11] About twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill, Venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and, after the United States, the second largest oil producer. Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935.[12] By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.[13]
First Dutch Disease[edit]
By 1929, the dramatic development of the Venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country, however, agricultural production began to decrease dramatically.[14][15] This sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the Venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the Dutch Disease. This "disease" occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy, causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors.[14]
Agriculture accounted for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countries.[citation needed]
Xenophobia[edit]
With a large influx of foreign "invaders", the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent. Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:

One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. They drew something (on a piece of paper) and opened their way through the forest. Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.

Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:

The workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond, blue-eyed men who own millions of dollars, pounds and gulden in European and U.S. banks, refused.

1940–1976[edit]

Venezuela production of crude oil, 1950-2012


In 1941, Isaías Medina Angarita, a former army general from the Venezuelan Andes, was indirectly elected president. One of his most important reforms during his tenure was the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Law of 1943. This new law was the first major political step taken toward gaining more government control over its oil industry. Under the new law, the government took 50% of profits.[8][16] Once passed, this piece of legislation basically remained unchanged until 1976, the year of nationalization, with only two partial revisions being made in 1955 and 1967.[citation needed]
In 1944, the Venezuelan government granted several new concessions encouraging the discovery of even more oil fields. This was mostly attributed to an increase in oil demand caused by an ongoing World War II, and by 1945, Venezuela was producing close to 1 million barrels per day (160,000 m3/d).
Being an avid supplier of petroleum to the Allies of World War II, Venezuela had increased its production by 42 percent from 1943-44 alone.[17] Even after the war, oil demand continued to rise due to the fact that there was an increase from twenty-six million to forty million cars in service in the United States from 1945 to 1950.[18]
By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern countries had started contributing significant amounts of oil to the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas. The world experienced an over-supply of oil, and prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Creation of OPEC[edit]

Main article: OPEC




OPEC countries


In response to the chronically low oil prices of the mid and late 1950s, oil producing countries Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait met in Baghdad in September 1960 to form the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The main goal of the OPEC member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations. This was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale.
Oil embargo of 1973[edit]
Main article: 1973 oil crisis
In the early 1970s, oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation. In 1972 they rapidly obtained a 25 percent participation, and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to 60 percent participation in the ownership of the companies.[8] By 1973, OPEC Persian Gulf states members decided to raise their prices by 70 percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to Israel (the United States and the Netherlands). This event became known as the 1973 oil crisis. Following a culmination of conflicts in the Middle East and the oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf no longer exporting to the United States and oil prices rising steeply, Venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits. Between 1972 and 1974, the Venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled.[14] With a new sense of confidence, Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez pledged that Venezuela would develop significantly within a few years.[14] By substituting imports, subsidies, and protective tariffs, he planned to use oil profits to increase employment, fight poverty, increase income, and diversify the economy. However, OPEC members had been violating production quotas, and oil prices fell drastically again in the 1980s, pushing Venezuela deeper into debt.
Nationalization[edit]




Petroleum map of Venezuela, 1972


Well before 1976, Venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession.[8] The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.[8]
Nationalization become official when the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, "La Gran Venezuela", called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution. The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies. Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC)-predecessor.[19]
All the new companies are owned by a holding company-Petroven or PDV- and in its turned owned by the State.[20] Ultimately not much had changed in this regard, as all Venezuelans with leading positions in the MNCs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies,[20] and therefore still securing their interests in Venezuela's oil. PDVSA controls activity involving oil and natural gas in Venezuela. In 1980, in an aggressive internationalization plan, PDVSA bought refineries in USA and Europe as the American Citgo that catapultated it to the third-largest oil company in the world.[14]
1977–1998[edit]
After the 1973 oil crisis, the brief period of economic prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short lived. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."[21] This was the case during the "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Second Dutch Disease[edit]
During the mid-1980s, Venezuela's oil production steadily began to rise.[22] By the 1990s, symptoms of the Dutch Disease were once again becoming apparent. Between 1990-99, Venezuela's industrial production declined from 50 percent to 24 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared to a decrease of 36 percent to 29 percent for the rest of Latin America,[23] but production levels continued to rise until 1998.[22]
However, the efficiency of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving a remainder of 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving a remainder of only 36 percent for the government.[24]
1999–present[edit]




Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.




"There is no question that Venezuela under Chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world."

Foreign Policy[25]
After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total. Chávez’s policies damaged Venezuela's oil industry due to lack of investment, corruption and cash shortages.[26][27]
The Chávez government used PDVSA resources to fund social programmes, treating it like a "piggybank",[28] and PDVSA staff were required to support Chávez. His social policies resulted in overspending[25][29][30] that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.[31][32][33]
According to Corrales and Penfold, "Chávez was not the first president in Venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil, but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.[34]
Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued much of the policies created by Chávez, with Venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies.[25][29][30][35]
Reinforcement of OPEC[edit]
At the time of Chávez's election, OPEC had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created. A combination of OPEC members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state of OPEC in 25 years (the second ever).[14] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.[citation needed]
The meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but much of that is also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.[36]
Enabling act laws and controversy[edit]

Bolivarian propaganda supporting Chávez on the PDVSA Towers in Maracaibo.


In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted Chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions.[37] On 13 November 2001 while ruling by decree, Chávez enacted the new Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.[37] The laws "marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes.[38] For the opposition to Chávez, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a "dictator-in-training".[37]
Chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas, such as ten percent of PDVSA’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs.[39] He also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process.[14] Chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over PDVSA and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over PDVSA’s small revenue contributions to the government. By 2002, warnings grew of the Chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support.[40]
In December 2002, PDVSA officially went on strike creating a near-complete halt on oil production in Venezuela. The aim of the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 was to pressure Chávez into resigning and calling early elections. The strike lasted approximately two months, and the government ended up firing 19,000 PDVSA employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the Chávez government.[41] By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.[37] In April 2002, mass demonstrations occurred in Caracas and Chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
A few months after the failure of the coup and the return of Chavez, a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an "indefinite national strike" which, in many places, turned out to be a forced "bosses lock out" where the employees were prevented from working.[citation needed] When the strike ended, substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by 5 percent. This increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over 20 percent in March 2003.[42]
Following the strikes, Chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as "re-nationalization". He aimed at improving the efficiency of PDVSA in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation. Certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in Chávez's first term.[14] By 2006, the government had a 40 percent share, which was announced to be increased by 20 percent.[citation needed]
International deals[edit]
In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region. Chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more Venezuelan oil to China so his country can become more independent of the United States. The United States currently accounts for 65 percent of Venezuela's exports.[43]
In 2007, Chávez struck a deal with Brazilian oil company Petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil where crude oil will be sent from both Brazil and Argentina. A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine 100,000 barrels (16,000 m3) of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.[citation needed]
Third Dutch Disease[edit]




Shortages leave shelves empty in this Venezuelan store.


The Chávez administration used high oil prices in the 2000s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters.[25][40] The social works initiated by Chávez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, with Chávez's administration suffering from Dutch disease as a result.[25][44]




Shortages of gasoline in Venezuela in March 2017


According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";[45] oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 [...] to 89% in 2006";[45] and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".[45] By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed"[25] and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[46]
Economists say that the Venezuelan government's overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the country's economy, contributing to rising inflation, poverty, low healthcare spending and shortages in Venezuela going into the final years of his presidency.[25][29][30][35][40][47]
According to analysts, the economic woes Venezuela suffered under President Nicolás Maduro would have still occurred with or without Chávez.[48] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[49]

Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter.
Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world, and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. The government of Venezuela treats PDVSA as a cash-cow,[3] and the company only hires political supporters of the president.[4] Between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to the government's social development projects. Around half of this went directly to various Bolivarian Missions, with the remainder distributed via the National Development Fund.[5] Incompetence has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents.[6]

Venezuela has 77.5 billion barrels (1.232×1010 m3) of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated 235 billion barrels (3.74×1010 m3) of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has 150 trillion cubic feet (4.2×1012 m3) of natural gas reserves.
PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of 4 million barrels (640,000 m3) per day (600,000 m³). Officials say production is around 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m3/d) although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d) lower.
Politicization[edit]
In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami".[7]
PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects.[8]

PDVSA purchased 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remainder in 1990.[9]
2000s[edit]




Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA)


In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for 2 months. 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed without compensation, and the government eventually reestablished production with employees loyal to the elected government.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch "an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture", surrounding this strike.[2] The strike caused substantial macroeconomic damage, pushing unemployment up by 5% to a peak of over 20% in March 2003.[3] The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential "coup" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's "socialist revolution".[10]
In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58.[4]
In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.
In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price.[5] Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.
In February 2006 PDVSA completed ISO 9001:2000 process certification for its distribution system.[6]
On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).[1]
PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.[11]
PDVSA is Latin America's third-largest company, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.[12]
2010s[edit]
In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd.[13]
In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas.[14] In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture.[15] In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.[16]
Following the death of Chávez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly.[17] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[18]
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.[19]
Nationalization[edit]
Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976, and along with it came the birth of PDVSA. See: History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Nationalization
Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total. Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retain minority interests in their Venezuelan projects.[20] Arriving at a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult with Venezuela offering book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asking for as much as $12 billion. This and a number of other matters including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.[21] PDVSA has paid compensation for assets it has nationalized including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.[22]
Safety[edit]
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003,[4] culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes.[23] Another major fire broke out at the El Palito refinery in September 2012.[24]

Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Spanish pronunciation: [peðeˈβesa]) (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter.
Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world, and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. The government of Venezuela treats PDVSA as a cash-cow,[3] and the company only hires political supporters of the president.[4] Between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to the government's social development projects. Around half of this went directly to various Bolivarian Missions, with the remainder distributed via the National Development Fund.[5] Incompetence has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents.[6]

Reserves and capacity[edit]

Venezuela has 77.5 billion barrels (1.232×1010 m3) of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated 235 billion barrels (3.74×1010 m3) of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has 150 trillion cubic feet (4.2×1012 m3) of natural gas reserves.
PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of 4 million barrels (640,000 m3) per day (600,000 m³). Officials say production is around 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m3/d) although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d) lower.
Politicization[edit]
In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami".[7]
PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects.[8]
History[edit]
1980s/1990s[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


PDVSA purchased 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remainder in 1990.[9]
2000s[edit]




Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA)


In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for 2 months. 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed without compensation, and the government eventually reestablished production with employees loyal to the elected government.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch "an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture", surrounding this strike.[2] The strike caused substantial macroeconomic damage, pushing unemployment up by 5% to a peak of over 20% in March 2003.[3] The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential "coup" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's "socialist revolution".[10]
In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58.[4]
In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.
In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price.[5] Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.
In February 2006 PDVSA completed ISO 9001:2000 process certification for its distribution system.[6]
On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008).[1]
PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.[11]
PDVSA is Latin America's third-largest company, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.[12]
2010s[edit]
In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd.[13]
In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas.[14] In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture.[15] In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.[16]
Following the death of Chávez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly.[17] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[18]
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.[19]
Nationalization[edit]
Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976, and along with it came the birth of PDVSA. See: History of the Venezuelan oil industry#Nationalization
Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total. Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retain minority interests in their Venezuelan projects.[20] Arriving at a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult with Venezuela offering book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asking for as much as $12 billion. This and a number of other matters including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.[21] PDVSA has paid compensation for assets it has nationalized including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.[22]
Safety[edit]
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003,[4] culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes.[23] Another major fire broke out at the El Palito refinery in September 2012.[24]

Venezuela's historic inflation rate beside annual oil revenues.[1][2][3][4][5]



The Real and Nominal price of oil from 1861 to 2015.



Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated 296.5 billion barrels (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
In 2008, crude oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and the country was also the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world. Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).[6]

Pre-discovery[edit]
Indigenous usage[edit]
The Indigenous peoples in Venezuela, like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps, which ooze through the ground to the surface, in the years before the Spanish conquistadors. The thick black liquid, known to the locals as mene, was primarily used for medical purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.[7]
Spanish acquisition[edit]
Upon arrival in the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well, and for treating their weapons. The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.[7]
1908–1940[edit]




Juan Vicente Gómez






Ancient office of Mene Grande Oil Company


Despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them.[8] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the Zumaque-I (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, Mene Grande, was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin.[7] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to "invade" Venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action.
From 1914 to 1917, several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared for the first time on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.[7]
It was the blowout of the Barroso No. 2 well in Cabimas in 1922[9] that marked the beginning of Venezuela's modern history as a major producer. This discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world. Soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich, and by 1928 Venezuela became the world's leading oil exporter.[10] Oil ended Venezuela's relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers, making it a linchpin of an ever-expanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking.[10] Venezuela's oil production became a major factor in policy making in Washington before the Second World War.[10]
Cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nation's largest oil fields, which are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo. Other fields are increasing in importance, mainly in eastern Venezuela.[11] About twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill, Venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and, after the United States, the second largest oil producer. Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935.[12] By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.[13]
First Dutch Disease[edit]
By 1929, the dramatic development of the Venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country, however, agricultural production began to decrease dramatically.[14][15] This sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the Venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the Dutch Disease. This "disease" occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy, causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors.[14]
Agriculture accounted for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countries.[citation needed]
Xenophobia[edit]
With a large influx of foreign "invaders", the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent. Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:

One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. They drew something (on a piece of paper) and opened their way through the forest. Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.

Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:

The workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond, blue-eyed men who own millions of dollars, pounds and gulden in European and U.S. banks, refused.

1940–1976[edit]

Venezuela production of crude oil, 1950-2012


In 1941, Isaías Medina Angarita, a former army general from the Venezuelan Andes, was indirectly elected president. One of his most important reforms during his tenure was the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Law of 1943. This new law was the first major political step taken toward gaining more government control over its oil industry. Under the new law, the government took 50% of profits.[8][16] Once passed, this piece of legislation basically remained unchanged until 1976, the year of nationalization, with only two partial revisions being made in 1955 and 1967.[citation needed]
In 1944, the Venezuelan government granted several new concessions encouraging the discovery of even more oil fields. This was mostly attributed to an increase in oil demand caused by an ongoing World War II, and by 1945, Venezuela was producing close to 1 million barrels per day (160,000 m3/d).
Being an avid supplier of petroleum to the Allies of World War II, Venezuela had increased its production by 42 percent from 1943-44 alone.[17] Even after the war, oil demand continued to rise due to the fact that there was an increase from twenty-six million to forty million cars in service in the United States from 1945 to 1950.[18]
By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern countries had started contributing significant amounts of oil to the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas. The world experienced an over-supply of oil, and prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Creation of OPEC[edit]

Main article: OPEC




OPEC countries


In response to the chronically low oil prices of the mid and late 1950s, oil producing countries Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait met in Baghdad in September 1960 to form the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The main goal of the OPEC member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations. This was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale.
Oil embargo of 1973[edit]
Main article: 1973 oil crisis
In the early 1970s, oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation. In 1972 they rapidly obtained a 25 percent participation, and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to 60 percent participation in the ownership of the companies.[8] By 1973, OPEC Persian Gulf states members decided to raise their prices by 70 percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to Israel (the United States and the Netherlands). This event became known as the 1973 oil crisis. Following a culmination of conflicts in the Middle East and the oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf no longer exporting to the United States and oil prices rising steeply, Venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits. Between 1972 and 1974, the Venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled.[14] With a new sense of confidence, Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez pledged that Venezuela would develop significantly within a few years.[14] By substituting imports, subsidies, and protective tariffs, he planned to use oil profits to increase employment, fight poverty, increase income, and diversify the economy. However, OPEC members had been violating production quotas, and oil prices fell drastically again in the 1980s, pushing Venezuela deeper into debt.
Nationalization[edit]




Petroleum map of Venezuela, 1972


Well before 1976, Venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession.[8] The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.[8]
Nationalization become official when the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, "La Gran Venezuela", called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution. The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies. Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC)-predecessor.[19]
All the new companies are owned by a holding company-Petroven or PDV- and in its turned owned by the State.[20] Ultimately not much had changed in this regard, as all Venezuelans with leading positions in the MNCs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies,[20] and therefore still securing their interests in Venezuela's oil. PDVSA controls activity involving oil and natural gas in Venezuela. In 1980, in an aggressive internationalization plan, PDVSA bought refineries in USA and Europe as the American Citgo that catapultated it to the third-largest oil company in the world.[14]
1977–1998[edit]
After the 1973 oil crisis, the brief period of economic prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short lived. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."[21] This was the case during the "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Second Dutch Disease[edit]
During the mid-1980s, Venezuela's oil production steadily began to rise.[22] By the 1990s, symptoms of the Dutch Disease were once again becoming apparent. Between 1990-99, Venezuela's industrial production declined from 50 percent to 24 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared to a decrease of 36 percent to 29 percent for the rest of Latin America,[23] but production levels continued to rise until 1998.[22]
However, the efficiency of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving a remainder of 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving a remainder of only 36 percent for the government.[24]
1999–present[edit]




Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.




"There is no question that Venezuela under Chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world."

Foreign Policy[25]
After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total. Chávez’s policies damaged Venezuela's oil industry due to lack of investment, corruption and cash shortages.[26][27]
The Chávez government used PDVSA resources to fund social programmes, treating it like a "piggybank",[28] and PDVSA staff were required to support Chávez. His social policies resulted in overspending[25][29][30] that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.[31][32][33]
According to Corrales and Penfold, "Chávez was not the first president in Venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil, but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.[34]
Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued much of the policies created by Chávez, with Venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies.[25][29][30][35]
Reinforcement of OPEC[edit]
At the time of Chávez's election, OPEC had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created. A combination of OPEC members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state of OPEC in 25 years (the second ever).[14] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.[citation needed]
The meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but much of that is also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.[36]
Enabling act laws and controversy[edit]

Bolivarian propaganda supporting Chávez on the PDVSA Towers in Maracaibo.


In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted Chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions.[37] On 13 November 2001 while ruling by decree, Chávez enacted the new Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.[37] The laws "marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes.[38] For the opposition to Chávez, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a "dictator-in-training".[37]
Chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas, such as ten percent of PDVSA’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs.[39] He also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process.[14] Chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over PDVSA and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over PDVSA’s small revenue contributions to the government. By 2002, warnings grew of the Chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support.[40]
In December 2002, PDVSA officially went on strike creating a near-complete halt on oil production in Venezuela. The aim of the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 was to pressure Chávez into resigning and calling early elections. The strike lasted approximately two months, and the government ended up firing 19,000 PDVSA employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the Chávez government.[41] By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.[37] In April 2002, mass demonstrations occurred in Caracas and Chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
A few months after the failure of the coup and the return of Chavez, a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an "indefinite national strike" which, in many places, turned out to be a forced "bosses lock out" where the employees were prevented from working.[citation needed] When the strike ended, substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by 5 percent. This increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over 20 percent in March 2003.[42]
Following the strikes, Chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as "re-nationalization". He aimed at improving the efficiency of PDVSA in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation. Certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in Chávez's first term.[14] By 2006, the government had a 40 percent share, which was announced to be increased by 20 percent.[citation needed]
International deals[edit]
In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region. Chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more Venezuelan oil to China so his country can become more independent of the United States. The United States currently accounts for 65 percent of Venezuela's exports.[43]
In 2007, Chávez struck a deal with Brazilian oil company Petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil where crude oil will be sent from both Brazil and Argentina. A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine 100,000 barrels (16,000 m3) of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.[citation needed]
Third Dutch Disease[edit]




Shortages leave shelves empty in this Venezuelan store.


The Chávez administration used high oil prices in the 2000s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters.[25][40] The social works initiated by Chávez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, with Chávez's administration suffering from Dutch disease as a result.[25][44]




Shortages of gasoline in Venezuela in March 2017


According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";[45] oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 [...] to 89% in 2006";[45] and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".[45] By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed"[25] and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[46]
Economists say that the Venezuelan government's overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the country's economy, contributing to rising inflation, poverty, low healthcare spending and shortages in Venezuela going into the final years of his presidency.[25][29][30][35][40][47]
According to analysts, the economic woes Venezuela suffered under President Nicolás Maduro would have still occurred with or without Chávez.[48] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[49]

Venezuela's historic inflation rate beside annual oil revenues.[1][2][3][4][5]



The Real and Nominal price of oil from 1861 to 2015.



Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated 296.5 billion barrels (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
In 2008, crude oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and the country was also the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world. Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).[6]

Pre-discovery[edit]
Indigenous usage[edit]
The Indigenous peoples in Venezuela, like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps, which ooze through the ground to the surface, in the years before the Spanish conquistadors. The thick black liquid, known to the locals as mene, was primarily used for medical purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.[7]
Spanish acquisition[edit]
Upon arrival in the early 16th century, the Spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well, and for treating their weapons. The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.[7]
1908–1940[edit]




Juan Vicente Gómez






Ancient office of Mene Grande Oil Company


Despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in Venezuela for centuries, the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early 1910s. In 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez replaced his ailing predecessor, Cipriano Castro, as the president of Venezuela. Over the next few years, Gómez granted several concessions to explore, produce, and refine oil. Most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends, and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them.[8] One such concession was granted to Rafael Max Valladares who hired Caribbean Petroleum Company (later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) to carry out his oil exploration project. On 15 April 1914, upon the completion of the Zumaque-I (now called MG-I) oil well, the first Venezuelan oilfield of importance, Mene Grande, was discovered by Caribbean Petroleum in the Maracaibo Basin.[7] This major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to "invade" Venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action.
From 1914 to 1917, several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared for the first time on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.[7]
It was the blowout of the Barroso No. 2 well in Cabimas in 1922[9] that marked the beginning of Venezuela's modern history as a major producer. This discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world. Soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich, and by 1928 Venezuela became the world's leading oil exporter.[10] Oil ended Venezuela's relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers, making it a linchpin of an ever-expanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking.[10] Venezuela's oil production became a major factor in policy making in Washington before the Second World War.[10]
Cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nation's largest oil fields, which are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo. Other fields are increasing in importance, mainly in eastern Venezuela.[11] About twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill, Venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and, after the United States, the second largest oil producer. Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935.[12] By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.[13]
First Dutch Disease[edit]
By 1929, the dramatic development of the Venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country, however, agricultural production began to decrease dramatically.[14][15] This sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the Venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the Dutch Disease. This "disease" occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy, causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors.[14]
Agriculture accounted for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countries.[citation needed]
Xenophobia[edit]
With a large influx of foreign "invaders", the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent. Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:

One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. They drew something (on a piece of paper) and opened their way through the forest. Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.

Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:

The workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond, blue-eyed men who own millions of dollars, pounds and gulden in European and U.S. banks, refused.

1940–1976[edit]

Venezuela production of crude oil, 1950-2012


In 1941, Isaías Medina Angarita, a former army general from the Venezuelan Andes, was indirectly elected president. One of his most important reforms during his tenure was the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Law of 1943. This new law was the first major political step taken toward gaining more government control over its oil industry. Under the new law, the government took 50% of profits.[8][16] Once passed, this piece of legislation basically remained unchanged until 1976, the year of nationalization, with only two partial revisions being made in 1955 and 1967.[citation needed]
In 1944, the Venezuelan government granted several new concessions encouraging the discovery of even more oil fields. This was mostly attributed to an increase in oil demand caused by an ongoing World War II, and by 1945, Venezuela was producing close to 1 million barrels per day (160,000 m3/d).
Being an avid supplier of petroleum to the Allies of World War II, Venezuela had increased its production by 42 percent from 1943-44 alone.[17] Even after the war, oil demand continued to rise due to the fact that there was an increase from twenty-six million to forty million cars in service in the United States from 1945 to 1950.[18]
By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern countries had started contributing significant amounts of oil to the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas. The world experienced an over-supply of oil, and prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Creation of OPEC[edit]

Main article: OPEC




OPEC countries


In response to the chronically low oil prices of the mid and late 1950s, oil producing countries Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait met in Baghdad in September 1960 to form the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The main goal of the OPEC member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations. This was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale.
Oil embargo of 1973[edit]
Main article: 1973 oil crisis
In the early 1970s, oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation. In 1972 they rapidly obtained a 25 percent participation, and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to 60 percent participation in the ownership of the companies.[8] By 1973, OPEC Persian Gulf states members decided to raise their prices by 70 percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to Israel (the United States and the Netherlands). This event became known as the 1973 oil crisis. Following a culmination of conflicts in the Middle East and the oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf no longer exporting to the United States and oil prices rising steeply, Venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits. Between 1972 and 1974, the Venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled.[14] With a new sense of confidence, Venezuelan president Carlos Andrés Pérez pledged that Venezuela would develop significantly within a few years.[14] By substituting imports, subsidies, and protective tariffs, he planned to use oil profits to increase employment, fight poverty, increase income, and diversify the economy. However, OPEC members had been violating production quotas, and oil prices fell drastically again in the 1980s, pushing Venezuela deeper into debt.
Nationalization[edit]




Petroleum map of Venezuela, 1972


Well before 1976, Venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession.[8] The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.[8]
Nationalization become official when the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, "La Gran Venezuela", called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution. The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies. Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC)-predecessor.[19]
All the new companies are owned by a holding company-Petroven or PDV- and in its turned owned by the State.[20] Ultimately not much had changed in this regard, as all Venezuelans with leading positions in the MNCs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies,[20] and therefore still securing their interests in Venezuela's oil. PDVSA controls activity involving oil and natural gas in Venezuela. In 1980, in an aggressive internationalization plan, PDVSA bought refineries in USA and Europe as the American Citgo that catapultated it to the third-largest oil company in the world.[14]
1977–1998[edit]
After the 1973 oil crisis, the brief period of economic prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short lived. As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."[21] This was the case during the "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.[citation needed]
Second Dutch Disease[edit]
During the mid-1980s, Venezuela's oil production steadily began to rise.[22] By the 1990s, symptoms of the Dutch Disease were once again becoming apparent. Between 1990-99, Venezuela's industrial production declined from 50 percent to 24 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared to a decrease of 36 percent to 29 percent for the rest of Latin America,[23] but production levels continued to rise until 1998.[22]
However, the efficiency of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving a remainder of 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving a remainder of only 36 percent for the government.[24]
1999–present[edit]




Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.




"There is no question that Venezuela under Chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world."

Foreign Policy[25]
After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total. Chávez’s policies damaged Venezuela's oil industry due to lack of investment, corruption and cash shortages.[26][27]
The Chávez government used PDVSA resources to fund social programmes, treating it like a "piggybank",[28] and PDVSA staff were required to support Chávez. His social policies resulted in overspending[25][29][30] that caused shortages in Venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world.[31][32][33]
According to Corrales and Penfold, "Chávez was not the first president in Venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil, but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.[34]
Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued much of the policies created by Chávez, with Venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies.[25][29][30][35]
Reinforcement of OPEC[edit]
At the time of Chávez's election, OPEC had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created. A combination of OPEC members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state of OPEC in 25 years (the second ever).[14] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.[citation needed]
The meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but much of that is also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.[36]
Enabling act laws and controversy[edit]

Bolivarian propaganda supporting Chávez on the PDVSA Towers in Maracaibo.


In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted Chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions.[37] On 13 November 2001 while ruling by decree, Chávez enacted the new Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.[37] The laws "marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes.[38] For the opposition to Chávez, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a "dictator-in-training".[37]
Chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas, such as ten percent of PDVSA’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs.[39] He also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process.[14] Chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over PDVSA and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over PDVSA’s small revenue contributions to the government. By 2002, warnings grew of the Chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support.[40]
In December 2002, PDVSA officially went on strike creating a near-complete halt on oil production in Venezuela. The aim of the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 was to pressure Chávez into resigning and calling early elections. The strike lasted approximately two months, and the government ended up firing 19,000 PDVSA employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the Chávez government.[41] By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.[37] In April 2002, mass demonstrations occurred in Caracas and Chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt.
A few months after the failure of the coup and the return of Chavez, a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an "indefinite national strike" which, in many places, turned out to be a forced "bosses lock out" where the employees were prevented from working.[citation needed] When the strike ended, substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by 5 percent. This increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over 20 percent in March 2003.[42]
Following the strikes, Chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as "re-nationalization". He aimed at improving the efficiency of PDVSA in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation. Certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in Chávez's first term.[14] By 2006, the government had a 40 percent share, which was announced to be increased by 20 percent.[citation needed]
International deals[edit]
In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region. Chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more Venezuelan oil to China so his country can become more independent of the United States. The United States currently accounts for 65 percent of Venezuela's exports.[43]
In 2007, Chávez struck a deal with Brazilian oil company Petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil where crude oil will be sent from both Brazil and Argentina. A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine 100,000 barrels (16,000 m3) of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.[citation needed]
Third Dutch Disease[edit]




Shortages leave shelves empty in this Venezuelan store.


The Chávez administration used high oil prices in the 2000s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters.[25][40] The social works initiated by Chávez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, with Chávez's administration suffering from Dutch disease as a result.[25][44]




Shortages of gasoline in Venezuela in March 2017


According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue grew "from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";[45] oil exports increased "from 77% in 1997 [...] to 89% in 2006";[45] and his administration's dependence on petroleum sales was "one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government".[45] By 2008, exports of everything but oil "collapsed"[25] and in 2012, the World Bank explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country's exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[46]
Economists say that the Venezuelan government's overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the country's economy, contributing to rising inflation, poverty, low healthcare spending and shortages in Venezuela going into the final years of his presidency.[25][29][30][35][40][47]
According to analysts, the economic woes Venezuela suffered under President Nicolás Maduro would have still occurred with or without Chávez.[48] By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international water, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue.[49]

			PDVSA Profile
		






                           			
								Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.
							
						
					


Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., the state oil company of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is responsible for the efficient, profitable, and reliable exploration, production, refining, transportation and trade in hydrocarbons.
The company is deeply committed to environmental protection and its main objectives include fostering the socio-economic development of Venezuela, guaranteeing sovereignty over its natural resources, and serving and benefiting the Venezuelan people.
The Venezuelan State is PDVSA’s sole stockholder under the provisions of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and represents the economic and political sovereignty exerted by the Venezuelan people over oil, their main energy resource. Therefore, PDVSA’s actions must follow guidelines, plans and strategies by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, as well as the norms issued under National Development Plans for the hydrocarbons sector.
PDVSA was created in 1975 by the organic law that reserves the industrialization and trade in hydrocarbons to the State (LOREICH). The company relies on the commitment of its employees to the defense of the nation’s energy sovereignty and to the duty of adding the greatest possible value to oil resources, under the principles of unity, teamwork, spirit of collaboration and efficient use of reserves.
All of PDVSA’s units are focused on such concepts as the sovereign use of national energy resources and the promotion of technological independence. The latter is being achieved through the development and strengthening of Venezuelan-made technologies. These efforts generate quality jobs, economic growth and lead to the creation of wealth and welfare for the Venezuelan people.
Transparency and clear control of accounts is another fundamental value of PDVSA. In accordance with this principle, the performance of the board of directors, executives and workers is generally evaluated, taking into consideration their commitment to the honest and moderate administration of corporate resources.

	Item 4.    Information on the Company







	4.A  History and development of the company





	        Petróleos de Venezuela is the national oil company of Venezuela, which controls PDVSA through the Ministry of Energy and Mines.
	Petróleos de Venezuela was formed by the Venezuelan government in 1975 pursuant to the Organic Law Reserving to the State, the Industry and Commerce of Hydrocarbons ("The
	Nationalization Law"). Through its subsidiaries, Petróleos de Venezuela supervises, controls and develops the petroleum, petrochemical, gas, coal and Orimulsion® industries
	in Venezuela. These activities are complemented by Petróleos de Venezuela's operating companies established abroad, which are responsible for refining and marketing activities in North
	America, Europe and the Caribbean. See also "Item 7.A Major shareholders."




	        PDVSA's
	oil-related activities are governed by the Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002. PDVSA's gas-related activities are regulated
	by the Organic Law of Gas Hydrocarbons of September 1999 and its regulations dated June 2000.




	        Since
	its formation, Petróleos de Venezuela has been operated as a commercial entity, vested with commercial and financial autonomy. Petróleos de Venezuela
	and its domestic subsidiaries are organized under the Commercial Code of Venezuela, which sets forth the basic corporate legal framework
	applicable to all Venezuelan companies. We are domiciled in Venezuela and are governed by the laws of Venezuela.




	        Petróleos
	de Venezuela's registered office is located at Avenida Libertador, La Campiña, Apdo. 169, Caracas 1010-A, Venezuela, and our telephone
	number is 011-58-212-708-1111.





	4.B  Business overview





	        We engage in various aspects of the petroleum industry, including the exploration, production and upgrading of crude oil and natural gas, or upstream operations;
	the refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, or downstream operations; the production and marketing of petrochemicals; and the development and
	marketing of Venezuela's natural bitumen, known as Orimulsion®, and coal resources. Our crude oil and natural gas reserves and our upstream operations are located in Venezuela, while our
	downstream operations are located in Venezuela, North America, Europe and the Caribbean.




	        Through
	our exploration, production and upgrading executive office, we manage our exploration and production activities, our Orinoco Belt projects and the activities of our subsidiaries,
	Bitor, Carbozulia and CVP. PDVSA enters into joint venture agreements to pursue projects in the Orinoco Belt with international oil companies to extract and upgrade extra-heavy crude oil and to
	develop




	7










	Orinoco Belt's extra-heavy crude oil reserves. Through Bitor and Carbozulia, PDVSA manages the production of Orimulsion®, a fuel for electric generation created by emulsifying bitumen in
	water, and the production of coal in the state of Zulia in Western Venezuela. CVP coordinates activities related to exploration and production in new areas under profit sharing agreements with private
	sector oil companies.




	        Our
	downstream operations are conducted through our refining, supply and marketing executive office, through which we:






	




	operate
	refineries and market crude oil and refined petroleum products in Venezuela under the PDV brand name and in the Eastern and Midwestern regions of the
	United States under the CITGO brand name,






	




	own
	equity interests in three refineries (one 50%-owned by ExxonMobil, one 50.75%-owned by Lyondell and one 50%-owned by Amerada Hess) and in a coker/vacuum
	crude distillation unit (50%-owned by Phillips Petroleum) through joint ventures in the United States,






	




	own
	equity interests in eight refineries and market petroleum products in Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Sweden through two joint ventures (one
	50%-owned by Veba Oil and one 50%-owned by Fortum Oil and Gas OY),






	




	conduct
	most of our business in the Caribbean through the Isla Refinery (a refinery and storage terminal which we lease in Curaçao),






	




	operate
	storage terminals in Bonaire and The Bahamas,






	




	process,
	market and transport all natural gas in Venezuela, and






	




	conduct
	shipping activities.






	        In
	the United States, we conduct our crude oil refining and refined petroleum product operations through our wholly owned subsidiary, PDV Holding, which, through PDV America, owns 100%
	of CITGO. CITGO refines, markets and transports gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, heating oil, petrochemicals, lubricants, asphalt and other refined petroleum products in the United States, markets jet
	fuel directly to airlines and produces a variety of agricultural, automotive and industrial lubricants, waxes and private label lubricants for independent distributors, mass marketers and industrial
	customers as well as other clients. In addition, CITGO sells petrochemicals and industrial products directly to various manufacturers and industrial companies throughout the United States. In 2001,
	CITGO produced a total of 24.7 billion gallons of petroleum products. PDV Holding also owns 100% of PDVMR (through CITGO) and 50% of Chalmette Refining (through PDV Chalmette), each of which is
	primarily engaged in the refining of crude oil. In October 1998, we entered into agreements with Phillips Petroleum to form Merey Sweeny, a joint venture to process crude oil in the United
	States, and with Amerada Hess to form Hovensa, a joint venture to process crude oil in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We are, through our U.S. subsidiaries, one of the largest refiners of crude oil in the
	United States, based on our aggregate net ownership interest in crude oil refining capacity at December 2001.




	        In
	Europe, we conduct our crude oil refining and refined petroleum product activities through PDV Europa, which owns our 50% interest in Ruhr, a company operating in Germany and owned
	jointly with Veba Oel, and our 50% interest in Nynäs, a company operating in Belgium, Sweden and the United Kingdom and owned jointly with Fortum Oil and Gas OY. Through Ruhr, we refine
	crude oil and market and transport gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, petrochemicals, lubricants, asphalt and other refined petroleum products. Through Nynäs, we refine crude oil and
	market and transport asphalt, specialty products, lubricants and other refined petroleum products.




	        We
	conduct our petrochemical activities through Pequiven, which has three petrochemical complexes in Venezuela and is currently involved in 17 joint ventures with private sector
	partners.




	8










	        PDVSA
	Finance was established in 1998 to serve as our principal vehicle for corporate financing through the issuance of unsecured debt.




	        Our
	other important subsidiary is Intevep, through which we manage our research and development activities. Additionally, PDVSA manages an educational center, CIED, which is responsible
	for the training and development of our personnel.




	        See
	"Item 4.C Organizational structure" for a list of our significant subsidiaries.




	        According
	to a comparative study published by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly in 2001, based on a combination of operating criteria and other data for 2000, including reserves, production,
	refining capacity and refined petroleum product sales, we were the world's second largest vertically integrated oil and gas company, ranked sixth in the world in production and proved reserves of
	crude oil and fourth in the world in refining capacity and product sales. Venezuela has been exporting crude oil without interruption since 1914. In 2001, we accounted for approximately 26% of
	Venezuelan gross domestic product, approximately 80% of its exports and approximately 48% of its fiscal revenues.





	Business strategy





	        Our business strategy is to pursue the development of Venezuela's hydrocarbon resources with the support of both national and foreign private capital, to maximize
	shareholder value and ensure our financial strength. PDVSA's business plan for the years 2002-2007 focuses on the exploration, production, refining and marketing of hydrocarbons.
	Additionally, it promotes investment from the private sector in the overall development of the gas and petrochemical industry, in the industrialization of refining streams and in
	Orimulsion® and coal. PDVSA also seeks to maintain high safety and health standards in conducting its business, and aims to achieve effective and timely integration of business
	technologies in its operations.




	        As
	part of our business strategy, we intend to:




	        



	With respect to exploration, production and upgrading activities







	




	increase
	reserves of light and medium gravity crude oil,






	




	increase
	overall recovery factor,






	




	complete
	the development of our Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude oil projects,






	        



	With respect to refining and marketing







	




	invest
	in product upgrades and environmental compliance in Venezuela and abroad,






	




	expand
	our markets in Latin America and the Caribbean,






	        



	With respect to gas







	




	promote
	active national and international private sector participation in nonassociated gas reserves, processing, transmission and distribution.






	        



	With respect to petrochemicals







	




	develop
	new lines of business with natural gas and refining streams, and promote private investment.






	        The
	implementation of our business plan includes the following initiatives:






	





	Exploration, production and upgrading.



	Our exploration and production strategy focuses on increasing our
	efforts to search for new light and medium-gravity crude oil reserves and the continued replacement of such reserves, developing new production areas, adjusting our production activities to cater to
	market demands and agreements reached with OPEC members and with other oil producing
	countries, maintaining competitive production costs by using state-of-the-art technology and completing the development of our Orinoco Belt projects.






	9












	





	Refining.



	Our refining strategy focuses on upgrading our downstream operations in Venezuela, the United
	States and in Europe, our major worldwide markets, by upgrading our product mix to achieve a higher margin of refined petroleum products and to comply with all applicable environmental quality
	standards.






	





	Marketing.



	We plan to continue the expansion of our international marketing operations to ensure market
	growth for our crude oil and refined petroleum products and to increase brand awareness for our products. We also intend to strengthen our position in the United States through the efficient
	distribution by CITGO of its refined petroleum products. Through CITGO Latin America, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITGO, we plan to introduce the PDV and CITGO brands into various Latin American and
	Caribbean markets, including through wholesale and retail sales of refined petroleum products. In 2001, CITGO Latin America set up an office in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 2002, CITGO-branded service
	stations were established in Puerto Rico, and the PDV brand was recently launched in Argentina and Brazil.








	In
	Venezuela, we plan to continue to promote a reliable supply of our products and the use of unleaded gasoline (a process which we started during the fourth quarter of 1999), to improve the
	competitive position of our network of service stations, lubrication centers and macro-stores, to continue the development of our commercial network through business relationships and other
	associations and to increase our product supply to high traffic airports.






	





	Gas



	. The development of our gas business is one of our major goals. We plan to focus on creating investment
	opportunities for the private sector in nonassociated gas production, expanding our transmission and distribution systems and natural gas liquids extraction, processing and fractioning capacity, and
	developing new gas export ventures. We intend to operate most of the existing associated natural gas production fields, currently assigned to us by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. We will continue
	to explore and develop nonassociated gas reserves with the support of private investment. We also intend to support these activities using the gas transmission and distribution systems currently
	controlled and managed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.






	The
	Ministry of Energy and Mines completed a nonassociated gas licensing bid round for exploration and production activities in 11 new onshore areas in 2001. Out of these 11 areas, the following six
	were allocated and assigned to foreign and domestic investors: Yucal-Placer Norte and Yucal-Placer Sur (both development areas), Barrancas, Tinaco, Tiznado and Barbacoas (each exploratory areas). We
	anticipate that gas production will begin at the end of 2002 from the Yucal-Placer areas.




	We
	anticipate that development of our gas business strategy will require approximately $10,000 million in capital, including an investment of approximately $2,400 million for
	transmission and distribution systems. We expect that such capital expenditures will be obtained primarily through investments from the private sector. See "Item 5.B Liquidity and Capital
	ResourcesCash Flow from Investing Activities."




	We
	believe that our natural gas resources and Venezuela's geographical location at the center of the Atlantic Basin puts us in an advantageous position to achieve our goals with respect to our gas
	business. We believe that our gas business plan will also contribute to promoting an increased and more diverse use of natural gas as a fuel and as a raw material in Venezuela.






	





	Petrochemicals



	. We plan to continue to promote the development of the petrochemical industry in Venezuela by
	maximizing the use of our existing petrochemical infrastructure and by integrating our refineries and petrochemical plants to ensure maximum economic benefit and to promote independence of our
	business performance from the volatility of the oil and petrochemical markets. We intend to focus on three specific areas: development of petrochemicals from gas, industrialization of refinery streams
	and the manufacturing of certain aromatic products.






	10












	





	Orimulsion



	®. We plan to expand our Orimulsion® business and increase our production
	levels based on anticipated market opportunities, mainly in the Far East. We intend to carry out our planned expansion through joint ventures. The growing popularity of Orimulsion® as a
	fuel is due to a new formulation, which makes it more environmentally friendly and more economical. At this time, our entire Orimulsion® production is operated to meet the needs of our
	clients in Europe, Asia and the United States.







	Exploration and Production





	        Venezuela's proved crude oil reserves have continued to increase over the years, with a cumulative production of crude oil from 1914 through December 31,
	2001 totaling approximately 54.6 billion barrels. Venezuela's commercial production of crude oil is concentrated in the Western Zulia Basin and the Western BarinasApure Basin in
	Western Venezuela, and in the Monagas and Anzoategui states in the Eastern Basin. The large number of fields in production in these three basins are broadly distributed geographically and, as a
	result, substantially diversifies our production risk. The impact of a loss of production in any one field would be relatively minor when compared to Venezuela's total production. The Western and
	Eastern basins have produced 40.1 billion and 14.5 billion barrels, respectively, of crude oil to date. Substantial portions of the sedimentary basins in Venezuela have not yet been
	explored.

	Reserves







	        We use geological and engineering data to estimate our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, including proved developed and undeveloped reserves. Such data
	is capable of demonstrating with reasonable certainty whether such reserves are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs, under existing economic and operating conditions. We expect to
	recover proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves principally from new wells and acreage that has not been drilled using currently available equipment and operating methods. Our estimates of
	reserves are not precise and are subject to revision. We review these crude oil and natural gas reserves annually to take into account, among other things, production levels, field reviews, the
	addition of new reserves from discoveries, year-end prices and economic and other factors. Proved reserve estimates may be materially different from the quantities of crude oil and natural
	gas that are ultimately recovered.




	        Crude
	oil and natural gas represented 75% and 25%, respectively, of our total estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves on an oil equivalent basis at December 31, 2001.





	        Crude Oil.



	    We had estimated proved crude oil reserves at December 31, 2001 totaling approximately 77.8 billion
	barrels (including an estimated 37 billion barrels of heavy and extra-heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt). We also had estimated proved reserves of natural gas totaling approximately 148,295
	BCF (including an estimated 14,153 BCF in the Orinoco Belt). The average API gravity of our estimated proved crude oil reserves was 16.5° as compared to an average API gravity of
	23.8° for our crude oil produced in 2001. Based on 2001 production levels, estimated proved reserves of crude oil, including heavy and extra-heavy crude oil reserves that will require
	significant future development costs to produce and refine, have a remaining life of approximately 64 years.




	        From
	December 31, 1995 to December 31, 2001, our estimated proved reserves of crude oil increased by 11.5 billion barrels and our estimated proved reserves of
	natural gas increased by 0.82 billion barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE"). In 2001, 2000 and 1999, our proved crude oil reserve replacement ratio was 108%, 169% and 165% respectively. These
	variations resulted from revisions to




	13









	the expected recovery rate of oil in place and the application of secondary recovery technology to existing crude oil deposits.





	        Natural Gas.



	    We have substantial proved developed reserves of natural gas amounting to 103,807 BCF (or 17,898 MMBOE) at
	December 31, 2001. Our natural gas reserves are composed of associated gas that are developed incidental to the development of our crude oil reserves. A large proportion of our
	proved natural gas reserves are developed. During 2001, approximately 32% of the natural gas that we produced was reinjected for well pressure maintenance purposes.




	        The
	following table shows our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves and proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves, all located in Venezuela (see note 18 to our
	consolidated financial statements, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements"):

	Operations





	        We maintain an active exploration and development program designed to increase our proved crude oil reserves and production capacity. We have been successful in
	our efforts to increase our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves in each of the last 20 years. Beginning in 1992, we commenced a program designed to attract and incorporate private sector
	participation into our exploration and production activities. We currently conduct our exploration and development activities in the Western Zulia Basin, the Western BarinasApure Basin
	and the Eastern Basin in the Monagas and Anzoategui states. We are currently conducting extensive exploration and development activities in the Orinoco Belt of the Eastern Basin and in the other
	basins, either independently or together with foreign partners through joint venture associations. See "Item 4.B Business overviewInitiatives Involving Private Sector Participation."




	        In
	2001, our exploration expenditures were used principally to fund the drilling of 11 exploratory wells and acquisition of 2,748 km2 of 3D seismic lines and 577 km of 2D seismic lines.
	Additionally, nine exploratory wells were drilled and 33 km2 of 3D seismic lines were acquired pursuant to our operating services agreements. In 2001, we added 357 MMB proved crude oil reserves (46
	MMB from newly discovered reserves and 311 MMB from development wells), compared to 209 MMB in 2000 (5 MMB from newly discovered reserves and 204 MMB from development wells) and 184 MMB in 1999 (84
	MMB from newly-discovered wells and 100 MMB from development wells). In 2001, we invested $2,100 million in 479 development wells and other facilities.

	        Pursuant to operating services agreements relating to the Orinoco Belt, 9 exploration wells and 349 development wells were drilled in 2001, and 15
	exploration wells and 453 development wells were drilled in 2000.




	        In
	2001, our crude oil production averaged 3,094 MBPD (includes 52 MBPD attributable to our participation in the Orinoco Belt projects) with an average API gravity of 23.8°.
	This production level represented approximately 78% of PDVSA's estimated year end crude oil production capacity of 3,990 MBPD (includes 488 MBPD of crude oil production capacity attributable to our
	Orinoco Belt projects). In 2001, our average production costs of crude oil during were approximately $3.38 per BOE, or $2.17 per BOE excluding the production and costs attributable to our operating
	service agreements, and the average of our depreciation and depletion costs was $0.38 per BOE. See "Item 3.A Selected financial data."

	December 31, 2001, we operated approximately 19,583 oil wells and three gas wells. At such date, we had 37,659 gross kms2 of undeveloped acreage and 177,829 gross kms2 of
	acreage under development, including 49,194 kms2 developed pursuant to our operating service agreements.




	        On
	average, during 2001, our natural gas production was 6,000 MMCFD (or 1,034 MBPD on an oil equivalent basis), of which 1,907 MMCFD, or 32%, was reinjected for purposes of maintaining
	reservoir pressure. The net natural gas production of 4,093 MMCFD was consumed in production of liquid natural gas (8%), as fuel in refinery and production operations (39%), in petrochemical
	operations (11%) and the remainder (42%) was sold to third parties for power generation, aluminum, iron and other manufacturing industries and domestic uses. Approximately 75% of the 2001 natural gas
	production and of total estimated proved net natural gas reserves are located in the Eastern Basin. A significant portion of this production is transported through our pipeline systems for use by
	industries in the coastal and central regions of Venezuela.

	The

	Initiatives Involving Private Sector Participation





	        As part of the process encouraging private initiatives and investment in the oil industry, and pursuant to Article 5 of the Nationalization Law, with the
	approval of the National Congress, we are permitted to enter into operating and association agreements with private entities. Since 1992, we have undertaken projects with the private sector in
	connection with our exploration and development activities. See note 8(c) to our consolidated financial statements, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements."












	Private Sector Participation






	        












	Operating Service Agreements







	        During 1992, 1993 and 1997, PDVSA auctioned the rights to and entered into agreements with several international companies. The purpose of these agreements was to
	reactivate the operation of thirty-three oil fields which no longer met our minimum rate of return on investment threshold, using secondary and tertiary recovery techniques. The auctions conducted
	during 1992 and 1993 are referred to in this annual report as the "first and second rounds" and the auction conducted in 1997 is referred to in this annual report as the "third round."




	        The
	terms of the operating agreements entered into require the international oil company investors to make capital investments in the form of assets necessary to increase production in
	the relevant oil fields. These investors would then recover their investments by collecting operating fees and stipends from PDVSA, amounts to be determined based on pricing formulas derived from the
	amount of crude oil delivered to PDVSA during the term of the operating agreement. The operating




	18









	agreements also provide that PDVSA would own the capital assets employed in the production, retain title on the hydrocarbons produced and has no further obligations as to any remaining value of the
	assets existing in the fields. See note 8(c) to our consolidated financial statements, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements."






	





	The First and Second Rounds



	. A total of 27 oil companies were awarded rights to exploit 15 oil fields. An
	average of 337 MBPD of crude oil was produced from these fields in 2001, and it is expected that such production will increase to approximately 460 MBPD when the fields are in substantially full
	operation by 2005. As of December 31, 2001, these fields had estimated proved reserves of approximately 3.84 billion barrels of crude oil. As of December 31, 2001, under this
	initiative, foreign companies had invested in excess of $4,000 million.






	





	The Third Round



	. We auctioned the right to reactivate, rehabilitate, develop and additionally explore certain
	hydrocarbon reservoirs in 18 fields. An average of 165 MBPD of crude oil was produced from these fields in 2001. As of December 31, 2001, these fields had estimated proved reserves of
	1.76 billion barrels of crude oil. Our business plan currently contemplates daily production of 424 MBPD by 2005 under our operating service agreements. As of December 31, 2001, under
	this initiative, the operator companies had invested in excess of $2,500 million.

	These
	proved crude oil reserves correspond to the fields assigned to each of the operating service agreements and are included in our total proved crude oil reserves. Such operating
	service agreements will not necessarily result in the exploitation of 100% of those reserves during their term. See "Item 4.B Business overviewExploration and
	ProductionReserves." The proved reserves disclosed at December 31, 2001 do not include any additional reserves which may ultimately be proved based on secondary and tertiary
	recovery projects to be implemented by the operators of the service agreements.

	Exploration and Production in New Areas Under Profit Sharing Agreements







	        In July 1995, the Venezuelan Congress approved the profit sharing arrangements pursuant to which private sector oil companies were offered the right to
	explore, exploit and develop light and medium crude oil, on an equity basis in ten designated blocks with a total area of 13,774 km2, pursuant to the terms of the profit sharing agreements entered
	into by such companies and CVP, our subsidiary appointed to coordinate, control and supervise these agreements. Under the profit sharing agreements, CVP has the right to participate, at its option,
	with an ownership interest between 1% and 35% in the development of any recoverable reserves with commercial potential. Eight oil fields were awarded to 14 companies in 1996. The awards were based on
	the percentage of pretax earnings ranging up to 50% that the bidders were willing to share with the Venezuelan government. Our business plan currently contemplates an aggregate average daily
	production from the fields in these new areas of 460 MBPD by 2010. The profit sharing agreements provide for the creation of a Control Committee, as the ultimate authority for approval and control,
	and which shall make fundamental decisions of national interest for Venezuela in connection with the execution of these agreements.




	        To
	date, the private sector companies have not carried out significant commercial operations pursuant to the profit sharing agreements. The activities conducted in 2001 were comprised
	principally of completing the minimum exploratory work, continuing exploration efforts, and approving plans for evaluation and delineation. The activities related to the minimum exploratory work are
	conducted solely by the private sector companies. In 2001, PDVSA invested an aggregate of $880 million in connection with these profit sharing agreements, including an investment of
	$103 million to drill three exploratory wells and to conduct geological and engineering studies and environmental audits. Significant discoveries have been made in four of the eight oil fields
	explored. During 2001 and 2000, the profit sharing agreements relating to the areas of Delta Centro, Guanare, Guarapiche and Punta Pescador were terminated in advance in accordance with their
	provisions. See note 8(b) to our consolidated financial statements, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements."

	Orinoco Belt Extra-Heavy Crude Oil Projects.







	        The Venezuelan Congress approved the creation of four vertically integrated joint venture projects in the Orinoco Belt for the exploitation and upgrading of
	extra-heavy crude oil of average API gravity of 9° and marketing of the upgraded synthetic crude oil with API gravities ranging from 16° to 32°. These joint venture
	projects have been implemented through association agreements between us and




	21








	the various participating entities. The term of each association agreement is approximately 35 years after commencement of commercial production, and, upon termination, the foreign
	participant's ownership is transferred to us. Each of the projects is assigned an area that is expected to contain sufficient recoverable extra-heavy oil to meet planned output during the life of the
	association. For the foreign partners, the projects represent a significant opportunity to increase production and proved crude oil reserves. For us, the projects represent an opportunity to develop
	the Orinoco Belt's extra-heavy crude oil reserves.




	        The
	approval by the Venezuelan Congress of each of these associations sets forth the conditions under which each of the projects may operate and requires that the associations pay the
	standard Venezuelan corporate tax rate of 34% (as compared to a tax rate of 67.7%, revised to 50% in January 2002, that is applicable to our Venezuelan subsidiaries engaged in the production of
	hydrocarbon and related activities). In addition, in May 1998, the Ministry of Energy and Mines and PDVSA Petróleo signed agreements to provide relief from the
	16

	2

	/

	3

	% production tax, establishing instead a tax rate band ranging from 1% to 16

	2

	/

	3

	%, measured based on accumulated revenues and total investment.




	        The
	four joint venture projects in the Orinoco Belt are as follows:






	





	The Petrozuata Joint Venture



	. Petrozuata is a company owned by us (through PDVSA Cerro Negro, S. A.) and
	Conoco. The construction of facilities at Petrozuata began in 1997. Initial production of extra-heavy crude oil commenced in August 1998. Upgraded facilities were completed in 2001. These
	facilities have an anticipated production capacity of approximately 120 MBPD of crude oil with an average API gravity of 20° to 23°. During 2001, Petrozuata produced 109 MBPD
	of extra-heavy crude oil. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Conoco has agreed to undertake the refining process, which will take place at Conoco's Lake Charles refinery, in Houston,
	Texas.






	





	The Sincor Joint venture



	. Sincrudos de Oriente is a company owned by us (through PDVSA Sincor, S.A.), Total
	Fina and Statoil. This joint venture anticipates production of 145 MBPD of crude oil by 2002, and further anticipates reaching a production level of 190 MBPD with an average API gravity of
	30° to 32° by 2007.






	





	The Hamaca Joint Venture



	. Petrolera Hamaca is a company owned by us (through Corpoguanipa, S. A.), Texaco and
	Phillips Petroleum. This joint venture anticipates its initial production phase to yield 190 MBPD of extra-heavy crude oil by 2004 and 230 MBPD by 2007, with an average API gravity of 25°
	to 27°.






	





	The Cerro Negro Joint Venture



	. Petrolera Cerro Negro is a company owned by us (through PDVSA Cerro Negro, S.
	A.), ExxonMobil and Veba Oel. This joint venture anticipates a production of 117 MBPD of crude oil with an average API gravity of 16° by the end of 2002. Pursuant to the terms of this
	joint venture agreement, we have agreed to sell our share of upgraded crude oil produced by this joint venture (approximately 80% of total production) to the Chalmette Refining, a refinery in
	Chalmette, Louisiana, which is an equal share joint venture between PDVSA and ExxonMobil. During 2001, this joint venture produced 80 MBPD of extra-heavy crude oil. See "Item 4.B Business
	overviewRefining and MarketingRefining," and note 8(a) to our consolidated financial statements, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements."






	        The
	Orinoco Belt projects differ primarily by the quantity and quality of output. For our foreign joint ventures without a U.S. Gulf Coast refinery (i.e., the Hamaca and Sincor joint
	ventures), the projects are designed to produce a synthetic crude oil that can be sold to third-party refiners who would otherwise process light sweet conventional crude oil. For our foreign joint
	ventures with refining




	22









	capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast (i.e., the Petrozuata and Cerro Negro joint ventures), the projects are designed to produce synthetic crude oil that is suitable for a dedicated refinery.

	Operating Service Agreement with National Universities







	        In October 2000, we entered into operating service agreements with three National Universities: Universidad de Oriente (Eastern University), Universidad
	del Zulia (Zulia University), and Universidad Central de Venezuela (Central University of Venezuela). In these agreements, we auctioned the right to reactivate, rehabilitate and develop fields located
	in three geographical areas. The purpose of these agreements with the National Universities is to provide training and industry experience to Venezuelan university students, especially geophysics,
	petroleum engineering and geology students.




	        Each
	field will be developed by separate entities that are 51% owned by us and 49% owned by the respective universities. These fields are: Socororo, located in Anzoategui State (operated
	by Petroucv, S. A.); Mara Este, located in the Zulia State (operated by Oleoluz, S. A.); and Jobo, located in Monagas State (operated by Petroudo, S. A.). The total assigned area for all these fields
	is approximately 523 km2. As of December 31, 2001, these fields have estimated proved reserves of approximately 246.5 MMB of crude oil, with an average API gravity of 8° to
	22° API. We anticipate an average daily production from these fields of 46 MBPD by 2007 and our business plan anticipates a total investment of approximately $1.1 billion in these
	fields over the next 20 years.





	Refining and Marketing








	Refining







	        Our downstream strategy has focused on the expansion and upgrading of our refining operations in Venezuela, the United States and Europe, allowing us to increase
	our production of refined petroleum products and upgrade our product slate toward higher-margin refined petroleum products. We have also increased the complexity of our refining capacity in Venezuela
	and made extensive investments to convert our worldwide refining assets from simple conversion to deep conversion capabilities. Deep conversion capabilities in our Venezuelan refineries have enabled
	us to improve yields by allowing a greater percentage of higher value products to be produced. Such capabilities have resulted in an increase in our gasoline and distillate yield from 35% in 1976 to
	70% in 2001, and has allowed us to reduce our fuel oil production from 60% to 23% during the same period, resulting in an improved export product portfolio.




	23








	        We
	conduct refining activities in Venezuela, the Caribbean, the United States and Europe. Our net interest in refining capacity has grown from 2,362 MBPD in 1991 to 3,085 MBPD at
	December 31, 2001. The following diagram presents a summary of PDVSA's refining operations in 2001:

	        In order to maintain our competitiveness within international markets, we expect to invest approximately $3,035 million from 2002 through
	2007 in Venezuela to improve our refining systems and to adapt our systems to meet environmental regulations and domestic and international product quality requirements. We intend to implement
	AQUACONVERSION®, a PDVSA-owned technology for heavy crude oil processing, at the Isla Refinery in Curaçao. We are also expanding our delayed coking plants located at the
	refining complex in Paraguaná, Venezuela. Additionally, we are participating in projects aimed at the manufacture of gasoline. For example, the three fluid catalytic craker units
	located at our Amuay, Cardón and El Palito refineries are being modified to manufacture gasoline. A low sulfur gasoline production unit (currently in the engineering phase) is expected
	to be operational in the first quarter of 2005, using oil products and technology, developed by Intevep, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA. Finally, on March 13, 2001, we entered into a
	contract for approximately $300 million with a Venezuelan-Japanese Consortium led by the Japanese JGC Corporation (formed by the Japanese Chiyoda Corporation and the Venezuelan companies,
	Jantesa and Vepica) to construct naphtha hydro treatment facilities and diesel hydro sulphuration and environmental units in a refinery located in Puerto La Cruz, referred to in this annual report as
	the VALCOR project. This project is budgeted at $700 million and is anticipated to be capable of producing 45MBPD of gasoline and 30MBPD of diesel blending components for the local market and
	for export.






	Venezuela and the Caribbean






	        Our refineries in Venezuela are located at Amuay, Cardón, Puerto La Cruz, El Palito, Bajo Grande and San Roque, with rated crude oil refining
	capacities of 635 MBPD, 305 MBPD, 203 MBPD, 130 MBPD, 15 MBPD and 5 MBPD, respectively. We integrated our operations at the Amuay and Cardón refineries to form the
	Paraguaná Refining Complex, one of the world's largest refining complexes. We also operate the Isla Refinery in Curaçao, which we lease on a long-term basis
	from the Netherlands Antilles government. The lease expires in 2014. Through these refineries, we produce reformulated gasoline and distillates to meet the U.S. and other international market
	requirements.






	United States






	        Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, CITGO and PDVMR, we produce light fuels and petrochemicals primarily through our refineries in Lake Charles, Louisiana;
	Corpus Christi, Texas; and Lemont, Illinois. Our asphalt refining operations are carried out through refineries in Paulsboro, New Jersey; and Savannah, Georgia. At December 31, 2001, the rated
	crude oil refining capacities at each of the above refineries were 320 MBPD, 157 MBPD, 167 MBPD, 84 MBPD and 28 MBPD, respectively.




	        CITGO's
	largest supplier of crude oil is PDVSA. CITGO has entered into long-term crude oil supply agreements with PDVSA with respect to the crude oil requirements for each of
	CITGO's refineries. These crude oil supply agreements require PDVSA to supply minimum quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks to CITGO for a fixed period, usually 20 to 25 years. These
	crude supply agreements contain force majeure provisions which entitle the supplier to reduce the quantity of crude oil and feedstocks delivered under the crude supply agreements under specified
	circumstances.




	        The
	Lake Charles refinery has a rated refining capacity of 320 MBPD and is capable of processing large volumes of heavy crude oil into a flexible slate of refined products, including
	significant quantities of high-octane unleaded gasoline and reformulated gasoline. Its main petrochemical products are propylene and benzene. Its industrial products include sulphur,
	residual fuels and petroleum coke. This refinery has one of the highest capacity levels for higher value-added products production in the United States, with a multiple stream capacity that allows it
	to continue operating with one or more units shut down. This refinery has a Solomon Process Complexity Rating of 17.7 (as compared to an average of 13.9 for U.S. refineries in Solomon
	Associates, Inc.'s most recently available survey). The Solomon Process Complexity Rating is an industry measure of a refinery's ability to produce higher value




	26









	products. A higher Solomon Process Complexity Rating indicates a greater capability to produce such products.




	        The
	Corpus Christi refinery has a refining capacity of 157 MBPD and a processing technology that enables it to produce premium grades of gasoline that exceed that of most of its U.S.
	competitors and to reduce sulfur levels in refined petroleum products. This refinery has a Solomon Process Complexity Rating of 16.3. The Corpus Christi refinery's main petrochemical products include
	cumene, cyclohexane, and aromatics (including benzene, toluene and xylene).




	        The
	Lemont refinery processes heavy crude oil into a flexible slate of refined products. The refinery has a rated refining capacity of 167 MBPD and has a Solomon Process Complexity
	Rating of 11.7. This refinery is one of the most recently designed and constructed refineries in the United States. It is a flexible deep conversion facility that produces primarily gasoline, diesel,
	jet fuel and petrochemicals. The average API gravity of the composite crude slate run at the Lemont refinery is approximately 26 degrees.




	        The
	refineries in Paulsboro, New Jersey and Savannah, Georgia are specialized asphalt refineries. The Paulsboro refinery, which is particularly suited to process asphalt, also has
	facilities to process low sulfur, light crude oil whenever favorable conditions exist.




	        Through
	LYONDELL-CITGO, a joint venture owned 41.25% by PDVSA and 58.75% by Lyondell, we have a net interest in refining capacity of 109 MBPD in a refinery located in Houston, Texas with
	a refining capacity of 265 MBPD. PDVSA supplies a substantial amount of the crude oil processed by this refinery under a long-term crude oil supply agreement that expires in the year 2017.
	Under this agreement, LYONDELL-CITGO purchased approximately $1.5 billion of crude oil and feedstocks at market related prices from PDVSA in 2001. CITGO purchases substantially all of the
	gasoline, diesel and jet fuel produced at this refinery under a long-term contract.




	        Various
	disputes exist between LYONDELL-CITGO and its partners and their respective affiliates concerning the interpretation of agreements between the parties relating to the operation
	of the refinery.




	        In
	April 1998, PDVSA, pursuant to its contractual rights, declared force majeure and reduced deliveries of crude oil to LYONDELL-CITGO. On October 1, 2000, the force
	majeure condition was terminated and PDVSA deliveries of crude oil returned to contract levels. On February 9, 2001, PDVSA notified LYONDELL-CITGO that, effective February 1, 2001, it
	had again declared force majeure under the long-term crude oil supply agreement described above. As of December 31, 2001, PDVSA deliveries of crude oil to LYONDELL-CITGO have not
	been reduced due to PDVSA's declaration of force majeure. On January 22, 2002, PDVSA notified LYONDELL-CITGO that, pursuant to the February 9, 2001 declaration of force majeure,
	effective March 1, 2002, PDVSA expects to deliver approximately 20% less crude oil than volume of crude oil contracted to be delivered, and that force majeure will be in effect until at least
	June 2002. LYONDELL-CITGO has commenced an action against Petróleos de Venezuela and PDVSA Petróleo in the Southern District of New York. LYONDELL-CITGO alleges
	that Petróleos de Venezuela wrongfully declared force majeure events and reduced shipments of extra-heavy crude oil to LYONDELL-CITGO. See "Item 8.A.7 Legal proceedings."




	        Through
	Chalmette Refining, an equal share joint venture between PDVSA and ExxonMobil, we have a net interest in refining capacity of 92 MBPD in a refinery located in Chalmette,
	Louisiana. The Chalmette refinery processes upgraded extra-heavy crude oil to be produced by our Cerro Negro joint venture. PDVSA (through PDV Chalmette) has an option to purchase up to 50% of the
	refined products produced at the Chalmette refinery. PDVSA (through CITGO) exercised its option through December 2000. ExxonMobil, which operates both the Cerro Negro joint venture and the
	Chalmette refinery, purchased substantially all of the refined products produced by the Chalmette refinery at




	27









	market prices during 2001. See "Item 4.B Business overviewInitiatives Involving Private Sector ParticipationOrinoco Belt Extra-Heavy Crude Oil Projects".




	        In
	October 1998, we had entered into agreements with Phillips Petroleum to form Merey Sweeny, a joint venture to process crude oil in the United States, and with Amerada Hess to
	form Hovensa, a joint venture to process crude oil in the U.S. Virgin Islands.




	        Pursuant
	to the Sweeny joint venture, PDV Holding and Phillips Petroleum own an integrated coker and vacuum crude distillation unit within an existing refinery owned by Phillips
	Petroleum in Sweeny, Texas. Each party owns a 50% equity interest in this facility, which is composed of a 58 MBPD coker and a 110 MBPD vacuum crude distillation unit. Phillips will purchase heavy
	crude oil from us to be processed in the Sweeny refinery pursuant to a processing agreement. Revenues from the Sweeny joint venture will consist of fees paid by Phillips Petroleum to the joint venture
	under the processing agreement and any revenues from the sale of coke to third parties. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements."




	        Pursuant
	to the Hovensa joint venture, we purchased a 50% interest in a refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands previously owned by Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation, with a current
	refining capacity of approximately 495 MBPD. The joint venture has entered into long-term supply contracts with PDVSA for up to 60% of its crude oil requirements and will construct a coker
	facility to process heavy crude oils. It is anticipated that construction of this coker facility will be completed by July 2002.






	Europe






	        Through Ruhr, a joint venture owned 50% by PDVSA and Veba Oel, we have equity interests in refineries in four German refineries (Gelsenkirchen, Neustadt,
	Karlsruhe and Schwedt) in which our net interest in crude oil refining capacity at December 31, 2001 was 113 MBPD, 31 MBPD, 33 MBPD and 39 MBPD, respectively. Ruhr also owns two petrochemical
	complexes (Gelsenkirchen and Münchmünster). The Gelsenkirchen complex, which includes modern, large-scale units that are integrated with the crude oil refineries located
	in the same complex, primarily produces olefins, aromatic products, ammonia and methanol. The Münchmünster complex, integrated with the nearby Bayear Oil refinery,
	primarily produces olefins. Ruhr's petrochemical complexes have an average production capacity of approximately 3.8 million metric tons per year of olefins, aromatic products, methanol, ammonia
	and various other petrochemical products.




	        Through
	Nynäs, a joint venture owned 50.001% by PDV Europa and 49.999% by Fortum Oil and Gas OY, we own interests in four specialized refineries: Nynäshamn
	and Gothenberg in Sweden, Antwerp in Belgium and Dundee in Scotland. Our net interest in crude oil refining capacity in each of these refineries at December 31, 2001 was 11 MBPD, 6 MBPD, 7 MBPD
	and 5 MBPD, respectively. The Nynäs refineries are specially designed to process heavy sour crude oil. Nynäs also owns a 50% interest in a refinery in Eastham, England.
	The Eastham refinery is a specialized asphalt refinery in which our net interest crude oil refining capacity at December 31, 2001 was 7 MBPD.




	        The
	Nynäs refineries in Nynäshamn produce asphalt and naphthenic specialty oils. The Dundee, Gothenbeug, Antwerp and Eastham refineries are specialized
	asphalt refineries. Nynäs purchases crude oil from us and produces asphalt and naphthenic specialty oils, two products for which Venezuelan heavy sour crude oil is particularly well
	suited feedstock due to its proportions of naphthenic, paraffinic and aromatic compounds. Asphalt products are used for road construction and various industrial purposes, while naphthenic specialty
	oils are used principally in electrical transformers, as mechanical process oils and in the rubber and printing ink industries.




	        The
	following table sets forth our aggregate refinery capacity, input supplied by us (out of our own production or bought in the open market), product yield and utilization rate for the
	three-year period ended December 31, 2001.

	        In 2001, we supplied substantially all of the crude oil requirements to our Venezuelan refineries (approximately 1,060 MBPD), 229 MBPD of crude
	oil to our leased refinery in Curaçao and an aggregate of 1,255 MBPD of crude oil to refineries owned by our international subsidiaries or in which we otherwise have an interest. Of the
	total volumes supplied by us to our international affiliates, 202 MBPD were purchased by PDVSA in the global market and supplied to our European affiliates. Additionally, CITGO and PDVMR purchased a
	total of 290 MBPD of crude oil from PDVSA for processing in their refineries.







	Marketing







	        In 2001, we exported 2,065 MBPD of crude oil or 67% of our total crude oil production and 697 MBPD of refined petroleum products produced in Venezuela. Of total
	exports of crude oil and refined petroleum products, 1,497 MBPD (54%) were sold to the United States and Canada. During the period from January through December 2001, according to the Petroleum
	Supply Monthly dated February 2002, we were the third largest aggregate supplier of crude oil and refined petroleum products in the United States.




	        Of
	our total crude oil exports in 2001, an aggregate of 1,190 MBPD (58%) were exported to the United States and Canada; 573 MBPD (28%) to the Caribbean and Central America; 151 MBPD (7%)
	to Europe and 151 MBPD (7%) to South America and other destinations.




	        Of
	our total refined petroleum products produced in Venezuela in 2001, approximately 458 MBPD were used in the domestic market and 697 MBPD were exported. Of the total exports of refined
	petroleum products in 2001, 307 MBPD (44%) were sold to the United States and Canada; 220 MBPD (32%) to the Caribbean and Central America and 170 MBPD (24%) to South America and other destinations.

	Marketing in the United States







	        Sales of Crude Oil to Affiliates.



	    We supply our international refining affiliates with crude oil and feedstocks either
	produced by us or purchased in the open market. Some of our U.S. affiliates have entered into long-term supply contracts with us that require us to supply minimum quantities of crude oil
	and other feedstocks to such affiliates for a fixed period of typically 20 to 25 years. These contracts are scheduled to expire in or after 2006.




	        Such
	contracts incorporate price formulas based on the market value of a slate of refined petroleum products deemed to be produced from each particular grade of crude oil or feedstocks,
	less certain deemed refining costs, certain actual costs, including transportation charges, import duties and taxes, and a fixed margin, which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other
	feedstocks delivered. Fixed margins and deemed costs are adjusted periodically by a formula that is primarily based on the rate of inflation. Because deemed operating costs and the slate of refined
	petroleum products deemed to be produced for a given barrel of crude oil or other feedstocks do not necessarily reflect the actual costs and yields in any period, the actual refining margin earned by
	the purchaser under the various contracts will vary depending on, among other things, the efficiency with which such purchaser conducts its operations during such period. These contracts are designed
	to reduce the inherent earnings volatility of the refining and marketing operations of our international refining affiliates. Other supply contracts between us and our U.S. affiliates provide for the
	sale of crude oil at market prices.




	        Some
	of the above contracts provide that, under certain circumstances, if supplies are interrupted, we are required to compensate the affected affiliate for any additional costs incurred
	in securing crude oil or other feedstocks. These crude oil supply contracts may be terminated by mutual agreement, by either party in the event of a material default, bankruptcy or similar financial
	hardship on the part of the other party or, in certain cases, if we no longer hold, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the ownership interests in the related affiliate.





	        Sales of Crude Oil to Third Parties.



	    Most of our export sales of crude oil to third parties, including customers in the
	United States with which we maintain long-standing commercial relationships, are made at market prices pursuant to our general terms and conditions, and priced in dollars. Among our
	customers are major oil companies and other medium-sized companies. Although our general terms and conditions do not require specified volumes to be bought or sold, historically, a majority of our
	customers have taken shipments on a regular basis at a relatively constant volume throughout the year.




	34










	        Sales of Refined Products.



	    We conduct all our retail sales in the United States through CITGO. CITGO's major products are
	light fuels (including gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel), industrial products and petrochemicals, asphalt, and lubricants and waxes. Gasoline sales accounted for 58% of CITGO's total sales in 2001.
	CITGO markets CITGO-branded gasoline through over 15,000 independently owned and operated retail outlets, located throughout the United States, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains.




	        CITGO
	also markets jet fuel directly to airline customers at over 24 airports, diesel fuel in wholesale rack sales to distributors and in bulk through contract sales (primarily as
	heating oil in the Northeast region of the United States) or on a spot basis, petrochemicals in bulk to a variety of U.S. manufacturers as raw materials for finished goods, including sulfur, cycle
	oils, liquid petroleum gas, petroleum coke and residual fuel oil, asphalt to independent contractors for use in the construction and resurfacing of roadways, and over 350 different types, grades and
	container sizes of lubricant and wax products.





	        Crude Oil and Refined Product Purchases.



	    CITGO owns no crude oil reserves or production facilities and must therefore rely on
	purchases of crude oil and feedstocks for its refinery operations. We are CITGO's largest supplier of crude oil, and CITGO has entered into long-term crude oil supply agreements with us
	with respect to the crude oil requirements for each of CITGO's refineries. CITGO also purchases crude oil in the market. In addition, because CITGO's refinery operations do not produce sufficient
	refined petroleum products to meet the demands of its branded distributors, CITGO purchases refined petroleum products, primarily gasoline, from third party refiners. CITGO also purchases refined
	petroleum products from various other affiliates including LYONDELL-CITGO, PDVMR, Chalmette Refining and Hovensa pursuant to long-term contracts. In 2001, CITGO purchased 424 MBPD of
	refined petroleum products under these contracts. In addition, CITGO occasionally purchases on a spot basis refined petroleum products from our Venezuelan refineries.






	Marketing in Europe






	        We supply crude oil to our European affiliates pursuant to various supply agreements. The crude oil that we supply to our European affiliates exceeds, as a
	percentage of total supply, our aggregate net ownership interest in such entities' combined refining capacity. In 2001, we supplied to the European refineries in which we held an interest 242 MBPD of
	crude oil, of which 40 MBPD were exported from Venezuela and 202 MBPD were purchased in world markets.




	        The
	crude oil processed at the Ruhr Oel refineries is supplied 50% by us and 50% by Veba Oel pursuant to a joint venture agreement and a long-term supply contract. Pursuant
	to these agreements,
	Ruhr does not acquire title to any crude oil or refined petroleum products. Instead, the crude oil supplied by us or Veba Oel remains owned by us or Veba Oel, as applicable, throughout the refining
	process. Our share of the refined petroleum products processed at the Ruhr Oel refineries is distributed through Veba Oel's marketing network. The operating costs of the Ruhr Oel refineries are shared
	equally by us and Veba Oel.




	        We
	receive 50% of the revenues from Veba Oel's sales of the refined petroleum products processed at the Ruhr Oel refineries, less attributable operating and marketing costs. This
	arrangement effectively provides Ruhr Oel with constant break-even results. We supply crude oil to the Ruhr Oel refineries and receive revenues from the sale of refined petroleum products
	attributable to such crude oil.




	        Nynäs
	purchases crude oil from PDVSA and produces asphalt and naphthenic specialty oils, two products for which Venezuelan heavy sour crude oil is particularly well suited
	feedstock due to its proportions of naphthenic, paraffinic and aromatic compounds. Asphalt products are used for road construction and various industrial purposes, while naphthenic specialty oils are
	used principally in electrical transformers, as mechanical process oils and in the rubber and printing ink industries. Nynäs




	35









	does not own crude oil reserves or production facilities and, therefore, must purchase crude oil for its refining operations. Nearly all crude oil purchased by Nynäs is supplied by us
	pursuant to long-term supply contracts. We supply Nynäs only with high sulfur, extra-heavy Venezuelan crude oil.




	        Nynäs
	markets asphalt products through an extensive marketing network in several European countries. Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe are the source
	of 24%, 22% and 24%, respectively, of Nynäs' consolidated revenues for 2001. Nynäs markets its naphthenic specialty oils throughout Europe, Africa, the Middle East and
	Australia, and the distillates that it produces are either sold as fuel or further processed into naphthenic specialty oils. Nynäs distributes its refined products primarily by
	specialized bitumen ships, rail tanks and trucks. Nynäs also maintains a terminal system network in Scandinavia.






	Marketing in Latin America and Caribbean






	        We have begun implementing our market development strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean, through CITGO Latin America, CITGO's wholly owned subsidiary.
	Through CITGO Latin America, we are introducing the PDV and CITGO brands into various Latin American markets, including through wholesale and retail sales of lubricants, gasoline and distillates. In
	2001, CITGO Latin America set up an office in Guayaquil, Ecuador, further advancing its presence in Latin American markets. CITGO-branded products were given a boost this year with the branding of
	service stations in Puerto Rico, the first CITGO-branded service stations located outside of the United States. The PDV brand was recently launched in Argentina and Brazil.

	        Since
	December 1993, the Venezuelan government has permitted private sector participants to market lubricants in Venezuela.




	        Since
	January 1997, through our subsidiary Deltaven, we have been marketing and distributing retail gasoline and other refined petroleum products under the PDV brand in the
	Venezuelan local




	36









	market. Deltaven is also promoting the development of the commercial infrastructure and services for retail clients with the participation of the private sector.




	        The
	retail of price for gasoline is set by the Venezuelan government and represents approximately 54% of the export price for gasoline in 2001.




	        Effective
	November 1997, the Venezuelan government has permitted private sector participants to market gasoline and other refined petroleum products in Venezuela through retail
	outlets owned or operated by such participants. At the end of 2001, three private domestic participants, Grupo Trebol, Llanopetrol and CCMonagas, and four private international participants, Shell,
	Texaco, ExxonMobil and British Petroleum, were marketing their products in Venezuela. These companies market their brands through 830 retail outlets owned or operated by them, and have a market share
	in the gasoline and diesel sector of 53% compared to Deltaven's 47%.





	Gas





	        Venezuela has abundant natural gas deposits that, in 2001, were estimated at 228 trillion cubic feet, of which 148 trillion cubic feet are proved reserves. Of
	these reserves, 91% are associated with crude oil deposits and 9% are in the form of free gas. At December 2001, our total production capacity and sales of methane gas were 2,325 MCFD and 2,107
	MCFD, respectively. Substantially all of the sales (99%) were to the Venezuelan market.




	        According
	to BP AMOCO Statistical Review of World Energy dated June 2001, Venezuela is the eighth-largest owner of proved reserves in the world and the largest owner of proved
	reserves in Latin America. These reserves can easily supply a domestic market of 1,917 MCFD.





	Transportation and Infrastructure








	Pipelines and Storage








	        Venezuela and the Caribbean.



	    We have an extensive transportation network in Venezuela consisting of approximately 3,113 km in
	total of crude oil pipelines (over 28 pipelines), with a throughput capacity of approximately 6,340 MBD of crude oil. These pipelines connect production areas to terminal facilities and refineries. We
	have a network of gas pipelines in Venezuela totaling approximately 3,781 km, with a throughput capacity of 2,748 million MM3D. Our network is composed of the Western and East Central systems,
	stretching from Lake Maracaibo, in the Zulia state to Punto Fijo, in the Falcón state and from Puerto Ordaz, in the Bolívar state to Barquisimeto, in the Lara state. We
	also have a network of 1,179 km of products pipelines with a total flow capacity of approximately 831 MBPD.




	        We
	maintain total crude oil and refined products storage capacity of approximately 30 MMB and 74 MMB in Venezuela, respectively, including tank farms, refineries and shipping terminals,
	of which approximately 16.3 MMB is available at our refineries. Our terminal facilities are comprised of nine maritime ports as well as two river ports. Construction is currently under way on our new
	terminal facilities at the Jose complex.




	        In
	addition to the storage and terminal facilities in Venezuela, we also maintain additional storage and terminal facilities in the Caribbean, located in Bonaire, the Bahamas, Trinidad,
	Curaçao and Statia, with
	an aggregate storage capacity of 50 MMB at December 31, 2001. The Curaçao oil terminal, which is leased from the Netherlands Antilles government, had a storage capacity of
	approximately 15 MMB at December 31, 2001.





	        United States.



	    CITGO owns and operates a crude oil pipeline and three products pipeline systems. CITGO also has equity
	interests in three crude oil pipeline companies and five refined product pipeline companies. CITGO's pipeline interests provide it with access to substantial refinery feedstocks




	37









	and reliable transportation to the refined product markets, as well as cash flows from dividends. One of the refined product pipelines in which CITGO has an interest, Colonial Pipeline, is the
	largest refined product pipeline in the United States, transporting refined products form the Gulf Coast to mid-Atlantic and Eastern seaboard states.





	        Europe.



	    Through equity interests in five European pipeline companies, we have interests in four crude oil terminals and four
	crude oil pipelines in northwestern Europe, including two pipelines from the Mediterranean coast to Germany. We also own three port facilities in the Rhine-Herne Canal providing barge access to Rhine
	and North Sea coastal ports.






	Shipping






	        At December 31, 2001, PDV Marina, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petróleos de Venezuela, owned and operated 21 tankers with a total capacity
	of approximately 1,347 MDWT and an average age at December 31, 2001 of approximately 12 years.




	        In
	2001, our total average shipments of crude oil and refined petroleum products amounted to 1,081 MBPD, of which 839 MBPD were shipped by our tankers and the remaining quantities were
	transported by chartered tankers.





	Petrochemicals





	        We engage in the Venezuelan petrochemical industry through Pequiven. Through Pequiven, our goals include increasing the capacity and flexibility of existing
	plants, both for local and international markets, and identifying new products or commercial opportunities, mainly in methanol, plastics and fertilizers. The raw materials currently used by Pequiven
	are natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, reformed naphtha and sulfur which are provided by PDVSA Petróleo, and phosphate rock, which is supplied by a Pequiven's subsidiary, Fosfato
	de Venezuela S.A., located in the state of Falcón in northwestern Venezuela.

	Includes
	$351 million, $329 million and $308 million of sales to affiliates for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively; and sales to PDVSA's subsidiaries, which are
	eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.





	        Pequiven and its joint ventures operate three petrochemical complexes, with a total combined production capacity of over eight million metric tons
	currently. The Morón complex, in the Carabobo
	state, primarily produces fertilizers and sulfuric acid. The El Tablazo complex, on the northeast shore of Lake Maracaibo in the Zulia state, produces mainly olefins, chlorine/caustic nitrogen-based
	fertilizers, industrial feedstocks and thermoplastic resins. The Eastern Jose complex, located on the north coast of the Anzoategui state, produces methanol, fertilizer, industrial products and
	methyl-ter-butyl-ether, or




	38









	MTBE. Pequiven also has facilities to produce aromatics in the PDVSA El Palito refinery, located in the Carabobo state. The gross production of Pequiven's wholly owned plants in 2001 and 2000 was
	approximately 3.6 million metric tons and 3.9 million metric tons, respectively.




	        At
	present, Pequiven has interests in 17 operational joint ventures, with most of their production facilities located in the three existing petrochemical complexes, and has interests in
	new joint ventures in various stages of development. The gross production of these joint ventures in 2001 was approximately 4.97 million metric tons, as compared to 3.1 million metric
	tons in 2000. Products of these joint ventures include methanol, MTBE, ethylene, propylene, dripolene, polyethylenes, polypropylene, ethylene oxide, glycols, caustic soda, chlorine, ethylene
	dichloride, fertilizers, caprolactam and other specialty products.




	        In
	January 1997, Pequiven and ExxonMobil entered into a preliminary development agreement to assess the possibility of building a polyolefins and glycol complex in Pequiven's Jose
	complex. It is expected that this project will require an aggregate investment of approximately $2.3 million and the joint venture would be owned in equal share by ExxonMobil and Pequiven.
	Basic engineering and class II cost estimates were concluded during 1999 and both partners are in the pre-development phase and are analyzing enhancements for the project in
	anticipation of entering into a definitive development agreement.




	        In
	April 1999, Pequiven signed a joint venture agreement with Koch Industries Inc., Snamprogetti S.P.A. and Polar Uno, C.A. to construct two ammonia and two urea plants in
	the Jose complex for a total investment of approximately $1,000 billion. The joint venture company is called FertiNitro and is owned 35% by Pequiven, 35% by Koch, 20% by Snamprogetti and 10% by
	Polar. According to the joint venture agreement, Koch and Pequiven will agree to purchase pursuant to long-term offtake contracts 50% of the output of the four plants at market prices. The
	plant was completed in April 2001 and began production shortly thereafter.




	        During
	1998, the Venezuelan Congress formally enacted legislation which, among other things, permits us to sell shares of Pequiven or any of our subsidiaries to local or foreign
	investors, to cause Pequiven to dispose of Pequiven's interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, and to sell Pequiven's assets to third parties. The net proceeds of such transactions, if any, would
	be used to develop further our petrochemical activities.




	        We
	invested $130 million in the construction of a petrochemical jetty at the Jose complex with capacity to handle refrigerated liquids, bulks solids and containers coming from the
	FertiNitro joint venture and the future polyolefins and glycol project. This facility began operating during the first quarter of 2001.




	        Our
	business plan contemplates increasing the aggregate capacity of Pequiven's own plants, and those operated by joint ventures, from 11.7 million metric tons in 2001 to
	17.8 million metric tons in 2007. We anticipate that the aggregate investments for these plants will be $4.9 million. We anticipate that $1.0 million in investments will come from
	Pequiven's own resources (including bank loans), and our joint venture partners will contribute the remainder.




	        Through
	our subsidiary, Proesca, we are also involved in a number of projects with the private sector to process intermediate refinery streams into higher margin products that will
	substitute imports and increase non-traditional exports such as solvents, propylene, waxes and oil tars.





	Natural Bitumen





	        The Orinoco Belt, located along the Orinoco River in Eastern Venezuela, has substantial reserves of natural bitumen, estimated to be in excess of 1 trillion
	barrels, an estimated 22% of which can be recovered by conventional petroleum exploitation methods. We are involved in several extra-heavy




	39









	crude oil projects in the Orinoco Belt to exploit these reserves. See "Item 4.B Business overviewInitiatives Involving Private Sector ParticipationOrinoco Belt Extra-Heavy
	Crude Oil Projects."




	        Additionally,
	through our wholly owned subsidiary, Bitor, we have developed a process of emulsifying natural bitumen in water to create an alternative liquid fuel to generate
	electricity, named Orimulsion®, which offers advantages over coal and fuel oil in terms of combustion properties, environmental impact, ease of handling and costs. Field development and
	production of the resources needed to manufacture Orimulsion® are currently carried out through operating arrangements and contracts entered into by PDVSA Petróleo and other
	parties.




	        Our
	Orimulsion® production capacity is 6.5 million metric tons per year, and the net production in 2001 was approximately 6.2 million metric tons, as compared
	to 6.3 million metric tons in 2000. In accordance with our business plan, Bitor plans to increase Orimulsion® production to 20 million metric tons a year by 2007 and is
	currently analyzing various projects for the expansion of its development and production capacity that would involve the establishment of joint ventures with several foreign oil companies. An
	association agreement was entered into in December 2001, among Bitor, China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation and Petrochina Fuel Oil Company Limited to build and
	operate additional production capacity up to 6.5 million metric tons by 2004.




	        Orimulsion®
	is marketed worldwide by Bitor through its wholly owned marketing subsidiaries. In Japan, Bitor markets Orimulsion® through its 50%-owned joint
	venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. Bitor's
	2001 production was sold mainly to customers in Italy (36%), Denmark (18%), China (16%), Japan (14%) and Canada (13%).

	Coal





	        We are an active participant in the coal mining industry through our wholly owned subsidiary Carbozulia. Venezuela's most important coal deposits are in the
	Guasare Basin, which is located in the northwestern state of Zulia. There are approximately three thousand million metric tons of coal resources and four mines in the Guasare Basin. Currently, two
	mines in the Guasare Basin are operational and approximately 14% of resources in the basin are being exploited. It is estimated that up to 50% of such resources can be exploited using current
	operating methods. Carbozulia has entered into two joint venture agreements with foreign companies to operate the two currently operational mines.

	Research and Development





	        Intevep is our wholly owned subsidiary responsible for research and technology support. Its overall mission is to create and sustain a competitive advantage for
	PDVSA through efficient and effective development, adaptation and application of technology. Intevep contributes substantially, through application of technology, toward the exploration for new oil
	and gas reserves, better utilization of existing reserves, increases in production, reduction in operational costs, greater productivity, upgraded processes for heavy and extra-heavy crude oil,
	improvements in product quality, improvements in health and safety standards and the development of new petroleum-derived products and innovative processes.




	        During
	2001, we continued to develop products and technologies such as MIS®, used in connection with heavy oil recovery and production; AQUADIESEL® (a
	low-emission diesel for public transportation vehicles, successfully tested in Houston); DISOL® (Gas-to-Liquid technology); and conducted early
	commercial tests of ISAL® (hydroconversion technology, successfully tested in a U.S. refinery, used to produce low sulfur, high octane gasolines). Further advances were obtained in the
	development of AQUACONVERSION®, which is a catalytic process used to produce high-quality diesels and medium distillates from heavy residues, successfully tested in downstream
	conversion in a Curaçao refinery; and HDH+ (technology to be used in Petrozuata for treatment and conversion of Orinoco Belt heavy and extra heavy crudes). With respect to environmental
	protection, we also developed two new products: INTEBIOS® (a biotreatment technology for the recovery of crude contaminated soils); and BIOLAGUNAS® (a system for phenol removal
	from water production streams). For long-term applications, Intevep is also conducting studies in biotechnology and nanotechnology (advanced materials), fuels for advanced vehicles and
	alternative sources of energy.





	Petroleum Investment Promotion Corporation





	        In 1995, we established the Petroleum Investment Development Corporation, also known as Sociedad de Fomento de Inversiones Petroleras, or SOFIP, as the entity
	responsible for developing investment vehicles, funds and other instruments that will allow local and international investors, including individuals, to invest in projects within the Venezuelan oil
	industry where private participation is allowed.




	        From
	1998 through 2001, SOFIP promoted funds whose portfolio consisted of investments in PDVSA's exploration and production projects that involved private sector participation, including
	Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude oil projects and operating service agreements entered into in 1997. This initiative was cancelled during the fourth quarter of 2001 due to adverse financial and
	petroleum market conditions. SOFIP ceased activities on December 31, 2001.

	Other Projects





	        In February 2002, with an investment of approximately $375 million, we began offshore drilling activities in a submarine platform in the Orinoco
	Delta, from a floating rig named Plataforma Deltana located in the Atlantic Ocean, close to the border with Trinidad and Tobago. This project aims to add new free natural gas reserves to meet internal
	and export market requirements. The Plataforma Deltana project will operate approximately 155 miles from the coast of Venezuela's Delta Amacuro territory, over a two-year period. The
	estimated production is 4.7 million metric tons per year. The total estimated investment in this project is $1,959 million for the period 2001-2007, of which 60% is expected
	to be financed by PDVSA and 40% is expected to be financed by private investors.











	        This
	floating rig drills exploration and outline wells, in search of potential hydrocarbon accumulations. The rig can operate at water depths of between 150 feet and 1,500 feet, and
	drill down to about 25,000 feet. Because of the nature of the operation, the drilling rig is of a size large enough to house a crew of about one hundred technicians and qualified workers.




	        This
	new venture into the gas business is seen as a potential contribution to meet the need for diversifying energy sources that help shape Venezuela's economic development. Similarly,
	the success of this project would further strengthen Venezuela's commercial competitiveness by improving its position in the global market, which has been progressively migrating towards the use of
	natural gas, as a clean non-polluting fuel.





	Environmental and Safety Matters








	Environmental







	        The majority of Petróleos de Venezuela's subsidiaries, both in Venezuela and abroad, are subject to various environmental laws and regulations
	under which they may be required to make significant expenditures to modify their facilities and to prevent or remedy the environmental effects of waste disposal and spills of pollutants. In the
	United States and Europe, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which may require them to take action to remedy or alleviate the effects on
	the environment of earlier plant decommissioning or leakage of pollutants.




	42








	        We
	have an investment plan to comply with the applicable environmental regulations in Venezuela. This investment plan contemplates approximately $1,998 million in capital
	expenditure from 2002 through 2007, including the following: $1,079 million for product quality; $583 million for risk control; $279 million for environmental adaptation; and
	$57 million for other environment-related investments.




	        For
	the purpose of compliance with future fuel specifications, both national and international, our production projects are aimed at the significant reduction of the sulfur content of
	fuels.




	        In
	addition to the activities outlined in our investment plan, expenditures of approximately $624 million are planned for remediation of 8,000 production pits as part of a global
	remediation plan that will culminate in 2010. The pits are excavations made in the soil and/or constructions of earth walls that were used in the past to temporarily store the waste generated by the
	exploration and production activities. These excavations were made when there was no appropriate technology available to avoid the use of pits. Currently, PDVSA does not excavate pits as part of its
	operations.




	        In
	addition, for the period 2002 - 2006, CITGO has planned expenditures of approximately $1,154 million to comply with environmental regulations in the
	United States.




	        In
	1992, CITGO reached an agreement with a state agency to cease usage of certain surface impoundments at CITGO's Lake Charles refinery by 1994. A mutually acceptable closure plan was
	filed
	with the state in 1993. CITGO and its former owner are participating in the closure and sharing the related costs based on estimated contributions of waste and ownership periods. The remediation
	commenced in December 1993. In 1997, CITGO presented a proposal to a state agency revising the 1993 closure plan. In 1998 and 2000, CITGO amended its 1997 proposal as requested by the state
	agency. A ruling on the proposal, as amended, is expected in 2002, with final closure to begin later in 2002.




	        In
	January and July 2001, CITGO received notices of violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency alleging violations of the Clean Air Act. The notices of violation are
	an outgrowth of an industry-wide and multi-industry U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforcement initiative, alleging that many refineries and electric utilities modified air emission
	sources without obtaining permits under the New Source Review provision of the Clean Air Act. The notices of violation to CITGO followed inspections and formal information requests regarding CITGO's
	Lake Charles, Louisiana and Corpus Christi, Texas refineries and the Lemont, Illinois refinery operated by CITGO. At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, CITGO is engaged in
	settlement discussions, but is prepared to contest the notices of violation if the settlement discussions fail. If CITGO settles or is found to have violated the provisions cited in the notices of
	violation, it would be subject to possible penalties and significant capital expenditures for installation or upgrading of pollution control equipment or technologies.




	        In
	June 1999, a notice of violation was issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency alleging violations of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
	regulations covering benzene emissions from wastewater treatment operations at the Lemont, Illinois refinery operated by CITGO. CITGO is in settlement discussions with the U.S. Environmental
	Protection Agency. CITGO believes this matter will be consolidated with the matters described in the previous paragraph.




	        Conditions
	which require additional expenditures may exist at various sites including, but not limited to, our operating complexes, closed refineries, service stations and crude oil and
	petroleum storage terminals. The amounts of such future expenditures, if any, are indeterminable. Management believes that these matters, in the normal course of operations, will not have a material
	effect on the financial position, liquidity or consolidated operations of PDVSA.




	43












	Safety







	        Due to the nature of our business, our operating subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject to stringent occupational health and safety laws in the jurisdictions
	in which they operate. As such, each of our subsidiaries and joint ventures maintains comprehensive safety, training and maintenance programs with the help of international and recognized leading
	authorities in this area. Our management believes that our activities are conducted substantially in compliance with all applicable laws.





	4.C  Organizational structure





	        Petróleos de Venezuela was formed by the Venezuelan government in 1975, and conducts its operations through its Venezuelan and international
	subsidiaries.




	        Through
	December 31, 1997, we conducted our operations in Venezuela through three main operating subsidiaries, Corpoven, S. A., Lagoven, S. A. and Maraven, S. A. In 1997, we
	established a new operating structure based on business units. Since then, we have been involved in a process of transforming our operations with the aim of improving our productivity, modernizing our
	administrative processes and enhancing the return on capital. The transformation process involved the merger of Lagoven, S. A. and Maraven, S. A. into Corpoven S. A., effective January 1, 1998,
	and renaming the combined entity PDVSA-P&G. In May 2001, we renamed PDVSA-P&G "PDVSA Petróleo" and began the process of transferring certain of our
	nonassociated gas assets to PDVSA Gas during the second quarter of 2001.




	        Additionally,
	we have also made several adjustments within our organization in order to enhance internal control of our operations, to optimize our governance model and to align our
	operating structure with the long-term strategies of our shareholder. These adjustments consist primarily of the adoption of an operating structure, increasing the involvement of our board
	of directors in our activities, and, at the same time, enhancing PDVSA's operational independence. These adjustments are also a part of our effort to promote private investment in our subsidiaries,
	PDVSA Gas, Pequiven, Bitor and Carbozulia.

Venezuela  Petroleum

<< Back to Venezuela Economy 
Petroleum dominated the economy throughout the twentieth century. In 1989 the petroleum industry provided almost 13 percent of the GDP, 51 percent of government revenues, and 81 percent of exports. Before the sharp drop in international oil prices in the 1980s, these ratios were considerably higher. From 1929 to 1970, the year of the country's peak production, Venezuela was the world's largest exporter of petroleum. In 1990 the country ranked as the third leading oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Iran, and contained at least 7 percent of proven world oil reserves. 
The country's national petroleum company, the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.--PDVSA), the third largest international oil conglomerate, owned refineries and service stations in North America and Europe. Although Venezuela was only the third largest petroleum producer in the Western Hemisphere, behind the United States and Mexico, its proven reserves, at 58.5 billion barrels in 1989, exceeded those of both countries. Venezuela exported 54 percent of its petroleum to the United States in 1988, representing about 8 percent of American petroleum imports. 
The first commercial drilling of petroleum in Venezuela took place in 1917. After World War I, British and American multinational oil companies rushed to Lago de Maracaibo to tap the country's huge petroleum reserves. Oil jumped from 31 percent of exports to 91 percent from 1924 to 1934. The industry proved extremely lucrative to the scores of foreign companies that drilled Venezuelan crude because of the country's low wages and nominal taxes, policies supported by corrupt relations between foreign oil companies and various military dictatorships. 
In the forty-year period after the death of Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935, the government and foreign oil companies engaged in a tug-of-war over taxation, regulation, and, ultimately, ownership. Although Venezuela reaped substantially greater benefits from its generous oil endowment after 1943, corruption and deceit on the part of the foreign companies and avaricious caudillos such as Pérez Jiménez still limited the national benefits of the industry. By the early 1970s, the possible nationalization of the oil industry became the focus of debate among labor, businesses, professionals, government, and the public at large. Aware of the conflicts and subsequent difficulties of Mexico's sudden, dramatic nationalization of the entire oil industry in the 1930s, Venezuela pursued its acquisition of the petroleum sector cautiously and deliberately. In December 1974, a national commission created by President Pérez delivered a proposal for nationalization. This proposal formed the core of the 1975 law that nationalized the oil industry. The most controversial element of the new law was Article 5, which gave the government the authority to contract out to multinational firms for various technical services and marketing. Despite the controversy, Article 5 provided technical expertise that proved crucial to the industry's smooth transition to state control beginning on January 1, 1976. 
In 1977 the government created a holding company, PDVSA, to serve as the umbrella organization for four major petroleum- producing affiliates. This process consolidated the holdings of fourteen foreign companies and one national company, the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Corporación Venezolana de Petróleos--CVP), into four competing and largely autonomous subsidiaries. Industry analysts have credited the competitive structure of the subsidiaries with increasing overall efficiency to levels well above those of most nationalized companies. The largest subsidiary of PDVSA was Lagoven, which was composed mainly of the facilities previously operated by the United States oil company Exxon. Lagoven accounted for 40 percent of national output in 1976. From the holdings of British and Dutch Shell, PDVSA created a subsidiary called Maraven. Four smaller United States companies became Meneven. Finally, PDVSA consolidated six smaller foreign firms and the state oil company into Corpoven. 
A slump in world oil prices beginning in 1981 rolled back the substantial revenues acquired, and largely squandered, during the 1970s. The symbolic end of PDVSA's prosperity came in 1982, when the Central Bank of Venezuela seized US$6 billion of the oil company's earnings to help offset the country's growing external debt problems. This action effectively eliminated PDVSA's autonomy. After oil prices dropped nearly 50 percent in 1986, the government accelerated industrial diversification programs in specialized petroleum refining, natural gas, petrochemicals, and mining, and also stepped up oil exploration efforts. 
Exploration remained a major focus of PDVSA activities in the 1980s. At the time of nationalization in 1976, exploration efforts had come to a near standstill. Little exploratory activity took place during the 1960s and 1970s because the Venezuelan government did not grant any new oil concessions after 1958 and most foreign oil companies anticipated eventual nationalization. Although financial constraints slowed the pace of exploratory drilling in the 1980s, major new finds of light, medium, and heavy crude by 1986 nearly doubled proven reserves. 
The country's 1989 oil reserves were expected to last for at least ninety-three years at prevailing rates of extraction. The Orinoco heavy oil belt accounted for 45 percent of proven reserves in 1989, followed by the Maracaibo region with 32 percent, the eastern Venezuelan basin with 22 percent, and 1 percent in other areas (see fig. 6). Only a small fraction of the Orinoco's total heavy oil deposits, however, were routinely included in estimates of total proven reserves because of the cost and difficulty of extraction. Some estimates of total recoverable heavy crude reserves ran as high as 190 to 200 billion barrels. 
PDVSA's early exploration strategy emphasized heavy crude, but by the 1980s the company's efforts shifted toward more valuable light and medium grades. This approach proved successful, as major new discoveries were made in the Lago de Maracaibo area, the Apure-Barinas Basin in southwest Venezuela near the Colombian border, and in the eastern Venezuelan basin in the El Furrial/Musipán area in the state of Monagas. Encouraged by its finds in the mid-1980s, PDVSA launched further drilling operations in the late 1980s, with the goal of adding 14.4 billion barrels of light and medium crude to its proven reserves by 1993. In addition to its land-based drilling, PDVSA established an increasing number of offshore rigs. The Venezuelans also explored off the coast of Aruba and had discussed with the governments of Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guatemala the prospects of exploratory drilling. 
PDVSA not only extracted crude oil, but also refined and distributed a wide variety of petroleum products. In 1988 six active refineries in Venezuela boasted an installed refining capacity of approximately 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. These refineries produced a full range of oil products and specialty fuels, making Venezuela an international leader in petroleum refining (see table 9; table 10, Appendix). PDVSA increased the percentage of locally refined crude from 35 percent to 58 percent between 1979 and 1988. In 1988 the country for the first time exported more refined petroleum than crude. PDVSA diversified its production during the 1980s, increasing the share of petroleum products that fell outside OPEC quotas until the late 1980s, in an effort to enhance price stability and boost profits. Orinoco Asphalt (Bitúmenes del Orinoco), a PDVSA subsidiary, began preliminary shipments in the late 1980s of orimulsión, a uniquely Venezuelan synthetic fuel derived from Orinoco heavy crude, water, and chemical additives. PDVSA hoped to export increasing quantities of orimulsión, outside OPEC quotas, to Canada and Europe as a substitute for coal or fuel oils used by electric power stations. 
From 1983 to 1989, PDVSA acquired overseas refining capacity from at least five multinational oil conglomerates, either through production contracts or outright purchases. For example, in 1983 PDVSA bought a 50 percent share of the West GermanApple LaserWriter Plus/IINT/IINTXAPLASPLU.PRSthe Swedish lubricant and asphalt producer, Nynas. Beginning in 1986, PDVSA entered the United States oil market by purchasing United States oil firms, refineries, and retail outlets previously held by Citgo, Champlin, and Unocal. PDVSA's overseas refining capacity exceeded 700,000 barrels per day by the close of the decade. By 1990, therefore, PDVSA had the capability to refine nearly all of its crude oil production, either at home or at Venezuelan-owned facilities overseas. Moreover, with PDVSA's purchase of Citgo in 1989, Venezuela became the first OPEC member to wholly own a major United States oil refinery. 
The United States has consistently been Venezuela's leading oil export recipient. During the 1980s, however, PDVSA increased its exports to Central America and the Caribbean. In 1980 Venezuela and Mexico embarked on a joint program called the San José Accord, under which the two oil producers exported oil to many countries of the Caribbean Basin (see Glossary) region at concessionary rates. The accord set up a system of compensatory finance and purchases of Venezuelan goods in exchange for crude that amounted to a 20 percent discount on the world market price.

Venezuela’s Oil-Based Economy
Venezuela is trying to develop new markets for its oil at a time of increasing friction with its main customer, the United States. But a significant short-term shift in oil relations between Venezuela and the United States is unlikely.

Introduction
Venezuela’s proven oil reserves are among the top ten in the world. Oil generates about 80 percent of the country’s total export revenue, contributes about half of the central government’s income, and is responsible for about one-third of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Increases in world oil prices in recent years have allowed Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to expand social program spending, bolster commercial ties with other countries, and boost his own international profile. Though Chavez has threatened to stop exporting Venezuelan oil and refined petroleum products to the United States, its biggest oil-trading partner, experts say a significant short-term shift in oil relations between Venezuela and the United States is unlikely. The medium-term outlook for state oil company PDVSA is questionable, however, and analysts draw links between PDVSA’s profitability and the political stability of the country.  Analysts say the recent global financial crisis and sudden drop in oil prices are adding to the oil company’s financial turmoil. Venezuela’s Economy under Chavez
Hugo Chavez took office in 1999. Since then, Venezuela’s economy has remained squarely centered on oil production. In 2006, Chavez announced a nationalization of oil fields managed by foreign companies, which resulted in an increase of the government’s shares in these projects from 40 percent to 60 percent. Government officials argue, however, that economic growth efforts are not solely focused on oil. Venezuela’s ambassador to the United States, Bernardo Alvarez Herrera, wrote in a 2006 Foreign Affairs essay that the non-oil sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, and agriculture, grew 10.6 percent in 2005, “indicating an important diversification of the country’s economy.” Yet even if the country is working to diversify,“oil still predominates,” says Miguel Tinker-Salas, a professor of Latin American history at Pomona College.
In 2002, the Venezuelan economy experienced a significant downturn following a failed military coup to overthrow Chavez and a two-month strike by the state-run oil company PDVSA. The response to the strike—the dismissal of more than seventeen thousand PDVSA employees—resulted in a rapid drop in GDP between 2002 and 2003. In subsequent years, rising international oil prices helped the economy to recover. In 2007, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates, economic growth was 8.4 percent.
Opinion is divided over the effect of Chavez’s policies on Venezuela’s economy. Some economists say the tremendous rise in social spending under Chavez has greatly reduced poverty and pushed unemployment below 10 percent, its lowest level in more than a decade. According to a February 2008 report from the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, not only has unemployment dropped, formal employment has increased significantly (PDF) since Chavez took office. But other economists express concerns about the country’s high inflation levels. The IMF has forecast inflation of 25.7 percent in 2008 and 31.0 percent in 2009—among the highest rates for any country in the world—and according to news reports, the country is already experiencing food shortages of goods such as sugar and milk. Francisco Rodriguez, former chief economist of the Venezuelan National Assembly, writes in a 2008 Foreign Affairs article that income inequality has increased during Chavez’s tenure, and further, Chavez’s social programs have not had a significant impact on infant mortality rate or literacy rates among Venezuelans. PDVSA
PDVSA (Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.), Venezuela’s state-owned petroleum company, oversees the exploration, production, refinement, and export of oil as well as the exploration and production of natural gas. It is the world’s third-largest oil company, behind Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil. According to Tinker-Salas, after the nationalization of Venezuala’s oil in 1976, PDVSA was very much like a “state within a state.” It “insulated itself from the government” and functioned largely as its own entity with control of the nation’s wealth. In 1980, PDVSA acquired CITGO, a U.S.-based refinery, and it is now one of the world’s largest refiners.
Under Chavez, however, the company’s mandate has drastically expanded. In 2002, Chavez redefined PDVSA’s role to include the government’s social priorities. PDVSA must now spend at least 10 percent of its annual investment budget on social programs. This money is funneled through the National Development Fund, or Fonden, an investment fund set up in 2005 that is not included in the government’s budget. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based center for policy analysis, says that Chavez’s gradual takeover of PDVSA has given him an enormous bankroll to pursue his political and economic ambitions.
Yet Chavez has also moved to expand PDVSA’s role in Venezuela’s oil ventures. In the 1990s, Venezuela opened its oil industry to limited private investment and allowed foreign companies to manage specific oil fields. Such “strategic associations” made up roughly 23 percent of total oil production as of 2006. In April 2006, Chavez announced the government would take a majority stake in such projects, increasing its share from 40 percent to 60 percent. Though this partial nationalization is expected to burden PDVSA with investment costs in the billions, in 2007 the president created seven new subsidiaries of PDVSA, including services, agriculture, shipbuilding, construction and industry. The head of PDVSA, Rafael Ramirez, told the New Yorker in June 2008 that Chavez plans to use the oil company to transform Venezuela from an "oil sultanate to a productive society within a socialist framework."
The financial crisis and oil price drop has had some impact on the oil company. In particular, PDVSA lost a $5 billion line of credit in October 2008. In early 2009, Chavez signaled the government would be open to more foreign investment in its oil resources, but analysts say there is little trust (Bloomberg) contracts would be honored over the long term. "Chávez is celebrating the demise of capitalism as this international crisis unfolds," Pedro Mario Burelli, a former board member of PDVSA, told the International Herald Tribune. "But the irony is that capitalism actually fed his system in times of plenty." Spending the Oil Money
It is difficult to determine how Venezuela has been spending its oil windfall, given the lack of government transparency (the country ranks 162 out of 179 countries ranked on Transparency International’s corruption index). However, from the few official figures the government has released and its stated pledges of aid to foreign countries, it is possible to glean a picture of billions of dollars dispersed on activities not directly related to PDVSA’s core business. Analysts express frustration that these reports lack detail, and efforts by news organization to obtain further information from government agencies have been rebuffed (NYT).
PDVSA has transferred billions of dollars to Fonden, the off-budget investment fund many experts say is financing Chavez’s social projects. According to International Oil Daily, an energy trade publication, PDVSA spent $14.4 billion on social programs in 2007 (as compared to $6.9 billion in 2005). These programs include projects such as medical clinics providing free health care, discounted food and household goods centers in poor neighborhoods, indigenous land-titling, job creation programs outside of the oil business, and university and education programs.
Increased oil revenues have also given Chavez the ability to extend assistance programs outside Venezuela’s borders. For example, he provides oil at a preferential price to many countries in the Caribbean through the Petrocaribe initiative.  In 2009, a Venezuela-backed home heating program to low-income households in the United States was briefly halted, a sign that low oil prices may be forcing Chavez to reconsider (TIME) some of his social programs.  In August 2007, the Associated Press calculated that Chavez had promised $8.8 billion in aid, financing, and energy funding to Latin America and the Caribbean between January and August 2007, a figure far higher than the $1.6 billion of U.S. assistance for the entire year. Though it is impossible to determine how much of that funding was actually dispersed, the difference in aid is striking. Chavez is also suspected of funneling money to the FARC, a Colombian guerrilla group, as well as providing funds to Argentine President Cristina Kirchner’s election campaign in 2007—though he denies both charges.
Military expenditures are also funded by the government’s flush coffers. Between 2004 and 2006, Venezuela spent roughly $4.3 billion on weapons, according to a January 2007 Defense Intelligence Agency report. As part of deals signed with Russia in 2006, Venezuela purchased 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles, twenty-four Sukhoi-30 fighter planes, and fifty-three Russian helicopters. In March 2008, it hired Belarus to build an air defense system.
Critics of Chavez think he should be pouring money into infrastructure to ensure a sustainable oil industry rather than allocating so much for social and foreign policy initiatives. According to the Wall Street Journal, PDVSA “spent just $60 million on exploration in 2004, compared with $174 million in 2001.” But Vicente Frepes-Cibils, the lead economist for Venezuela at the World Bank, says “investment is increasing” and Venezuela has an accumulation of reserves including outside funds ranging from $10 billion to $15 billion that it is planning to use for oil infrastructure. PDVSA’s Production Levels and Fiscal Health
PDVSA has not filed financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 2004. As a result, its production levels and overall fiscal health are subject to debate among economists and industry analysts. A report (PDF) by the International Energy Agency examining Venezuela’s extra-heavy crude oil production put PDVSA’s 2005 production rate at 3.2 million barrels per day but showed a decreased rate of 2.55 million in September 2006. Currently, OPEC, the U.S. government, and the International Energy Agency agree that Venezuelan oil production amounts to roughly 2.4 million barrels per day. The Venezuelan government, however, says PDVSA’s production is about 3.3 million barrels per day.
Either way, there are new signs that all isn’t rosy at PDVSA. In 2008, Venezuela’s energy ministry released unaudited results documenting a 35 percent fall in profits by PDVSA the previous year. A few months later, audited figures were released that indicated profits increased 15 percent in 2007. The International Energy Agency, however, shows a $7.9 billion loss in 2007.  Oil prices, which were extraordinarily high through much of 2008, helped mask some of the company’s financial woes. Since they began to drop dramatically PDVSA has struggled to keep up with its financial obligations, especially once it lost a $5 billion line of credit (CNBC) with the Royal Bank of Scotland in October 2008. The company had about $7.9 billion in unsettled accounts (Latin Business Chronicle) between January and September 2008, up from $5.7 billion during all of 2007, but analysts say so far the company is unlikely to default on its creditors. However, the company may need to make serious cutbacks or possibly even sell assets, analysts say.
Venezuela has an estimated 78 billion barrels of proven conventional crude oil reserves and an additional estimated 235 billion barrels of unconventional extra-heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region located southeast of Caracas. If development in the region can turn this extra-heavy tar-like oil into a more marketable commodity, Venezuela’s total reserves could rival those of Saudi Arabia, reports the New York Times. Oxford Analytica notes, however, that PDVSA will struggle to develop its heavy-oil reserves in a timely fashion given its lack of infrastructure investment and the ongoing oil nationalizations. Oil industry experts suggest that PDVSA needs to invest at least $3 billion annually into its existing fields just to maintain current production levels. Regional Ventures
Venezuela is South America’s third-largest market and is actively pursuing further economic integration with other countries in the region. In July 2006 it became a member of the South American trade group Mercosur (Mercado Común del Sur), joining Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Chavez has also spurred the creation of a regional development bank, known as Banco del Sur. Highlights of Venezuela’s recent regional agreements include:

Argentina. Venezuela and Argentina have made agreements to create an investment bank for infrastructure development, as well as joint hydrocarbon exploration and development in both countries. Venezuela has also purchased $3.5 billion in bonds to help pay off Argentina’s debt.

Brazil. In May 2008, Petrobras and PDVSA signed an agreement to build an oil refinery in northeastern Brazil, which is anticipated to require $4.05 billion in investment. Petrobras will hold 60 percent of the refinery’s shares. Crude oil will be supplied by both countries to refine a projected 200,000 barrels per day.

Colombia. In 2007, Venezuela and Colombia opened a natural gas pipeline that links northern Colombia’s La Guajira gas fields to the Paraguana refining complex in western Venezuela. Tensions between the two countries have heightened, however, since a March 2008 standoff in which Chavez sent troops to the Colombian border and temporarily severed diplomatic ties.

Bolivia. Venezuela and Bolivia signed agreements in January and May 2006 for Venezuela to supply preferentially priced diesel and invest $1.5 billion in the Bolivian oil and gas sector in exchange for Bolivian goods and services, according to Oxford Analytica.

Ecuador. In February 2008, Venezuela and Ecuador agreed to collaborate on an oil refinery in Ecuador estimated to cost $5.5 billion. Under agreements signed in May 2006, Venezuela is expected to refine up to 100,000 barrels of Ecuadorean crude oil per day at discount prices.

Cuba. Commerce between Venezuela and Cuba soared to $7 billion in 2007, according to the Cuban government (in 2006, trade was $1.7 billion). Venezuela is selling up to 100,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba, discounted by as much as 40 percent. In exchange, thousands of Venezuelans have traveled to Cuba for medical treatment, and Cuban doctors help administer health care programs for low-income Venezuelans.
U.S.-Venezuela Oil Ties
Though Venezuela has repeatedly threatened to cut off its oil exports to the United States, analysts say the two countries are mutually dependent. Venezuela supplies about 1.5 million barrels of crude oil and refined petroleum products to the U.S. market every day, according to the EIA. Venezuelan oil comprises about 11 percent of U.S. crude oil imports, which amounts to 60 percent of Venezuela’s total exports. PDVSA also wholly owns five refineries in the United States and partly owns four refineries, either through partnerships with U.S. companies or through PDVSA’s U.S. subsidiary, CITGO. A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report (PDF) says Venezuela’s exports of crude oil and refined petroleum products to the United States have been relatively stable with the exception of the strike period.
The World Bank’s Frepes-Cibils says “Venezuela will continue to be a key player in the U.S. market.” He argues that in the short term it will be very difficult for Venezuela to make a significant shift in supply from the United States. Nevertheless, Chavez has increasingly made efforts to diversify his oil clients in order to lessen the country’s dependence on the United States. The GAO report says the sudden loss of Venezuelan oil in the world market would raise world oil prices and slow the economic growth of the United States.

	Item 4.



	           

	Information on the Company




	 






	4.A



	         

	History and development of the company




	 





	PDVSA is the national oil and gas company of
	Venezuela.  PDVSA was formed by the
	Venezuelan government in 1975 pursuant to the Organic Law Reserving to the
	State, the Industry and Commerce of Hydrocarbons (the Nationalization Law),
	and its operations are supervised by Venezuelas Ministry of Energy and
	Petroleum (formerly the Ministry of Energy and Mines).  Through its subsidiaries, PDVSA supervises,
	controls and develops the petroleum, petrochemical, gas, coal and Orimulsion®
	industries in Venezuela.  These
	activities are complemented by PDVSAs operating companies established abroad,
	which are responsible for refining and marketing activities in North America,
	Europe and the Caribbean.  See also Item
	7.A Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.




	 




	PDVSAs oil-related activities are governed by the
	Organic Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002.  PDVSAs gas-related activities are regulated
	by the Organic Law of Gas Hydrocarbons of September 1999 and its
	Regulations dated June 2000.




	 




	Since its formation, PDVSA has been operated as a
	commercial entity, vested with commercial and financial autonomy.  PDVSA and its domestic subsidiaries are
	organized under the Commercial Code of Venezuela, which sets forth the basic
	corporate legal framework applicable to all Venezuelan companies.




	 




	Furthermore, the National Constitution of the
	Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Organic Hydrocarbons Law mandates that
	PDVSA contribute to social programs developed and administered by the
	Venezuelan government.  For example,
	PDVSA and its subsidiaries Palmeven and CVP contribute management as well as
	financial resources in support of social programs related to education,
	healthcare, job creation, and subsidized food distribution.




	 




	PDVSA is domiciled in Venezuela and its registered
	office is located at Avenida Libertador, La Campiña, Apdo. 169, Caracas 1010-A,
	Venezuela, and our telephone number is 011-58-212-708-4111.  Our website is: www.pdvsa.com.  Information contained on our website is not
	incorporated by reference into this annual report.




	 





	4.B



	         

	Business overview




	 





	PDVSA is engaged in various aspects of the petroleum
	industry, including:




	 








	







	 






	the exploration, production and upgrading of crude
	oil and natural gas or upstream operations;








	 






	 






	 








	






	 






	the exploration, production of natural gas from
	offshore sources, including the possibility for LNG export;








	 






	 






	 








	






	 






	the refining, marketing and transportation of crude
	oil and refined petroleum products and the processing, marketing and
	transporation of natural gas, or downstream operations;








	 






	 






	 








	






	 






	the production and marketing of petrochemicals. For
	our main petrochemical business unit Pequiven, the Venezuelan government
	decided in June 2005 to transfer the activities, assets and shares held
	by PDVSA in Pequiven (the companys shareholder) to the Ministry of Energy
	and Petroleum and to submit this transfer for approval by the Shareholder of
	PDVSA. The transfer is subject to the reform of the Petrochemical Act and the
	resolution of other legal and administrative issues;








	 






	 






	 








	






	 






	the development and marketing of Orimulsion®,
	Venezuelas derivative of heavy and extra-heavy crude, which will be produced
	until expiration of the current supply agreement.







	 




	Our crude oil and natural gas reserves and our
	upstream operations are located in Venezuela, while our downstream operations
	are also located in Venezuela as well as the Caribbean, North America, and
	Europe.




	 




	9














	 




	PDVSA has been structured in three vertically
	integrated geographic divisions to manage its upstream operations,
	including:  exploration, production, and
	upgrading.  These divisions are:  Eastern, Southern and the Western
	Division.  Since August 2003, CVP, a
	subsidiary, assumed from PDVSA Petróleo the management of the third party
	contracts (operating and profit sharing agreements), the Orinoco Belt joint
	ventures and ultimately offshore natural gas licenses.




	 




	Our downstream operations include:




	 




	


	     

	operation
	of refineries, marketing of crude oil and refined petroleum products in
	Venezuela under the PDV brand name and under the CITGO brand name for the
	eastern and midwestern regions of the United States;



	 




	


	     

	conduct
	of most of our business in the Caribbean through the Isla Refinery (a refinery
	and storage terminal which we lease in Curaçao);



	 




	


	     

	operation
	of the storage terminals in Bonaire and the Bahamas in the Caribbean;



	 




	


	     

	ownership
	of equity interests in three refineries (one 50%-owned by ExxonMobil, one
	58.75%-owned by Lyondell and one 50%-owned by Amerada Hess) and in a
	coker/vacuum crude distillation unit (50%-owned by ConocoPhillips) through
	joint ventures in the United States;



	 




	


	     

	ownership
	of equity interests in eight refineries and market petroleum products in
	Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium and Sweden through two joint ventures (one
	50%-owned by BP RP and one 50%-owned by Neste Oil, which currently owns Fortum
	Oil and Gas);



	 




	


	     

	processing,
	marketing and transport of all natural gas in Venezuela; and



	 




	


	     

	conduct
	of shipping activities.



	 




	In the United States, we conduct our crude oil
	refining operations and refined petroleum product marketing through our wholly
	owned subsidiary, PDV Holding, which owns through PDV America, 100% of
	CITGO.  CITGO also owns 41.25% of
	Lyondell-Citgo Refining LP.  CITGO
	refines, markets and transports gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel,
	petrochemicals, lubricants, asphalt and other refined petroleum products in the
	United States.  CITGOs transportation
	fuel customers include primarily CITGO branded independent wholesale marketers,
	major convenience store chains and airlines located mainly along the east of
	the Rocky Mountains.  Asphalt is
	generally marketed to independent paving contractors on the East Gulf and the
	Midwest Coasts of the United States. 
	Lubricants are sold primarily in the United States to independent
	marketers, mass marketers and industrial customers.  During 2003 CITGO sold lubricants, gasoline,
	and distillates in various Latin American markets, including Puerto Rico,
	Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama and
	Guatemala, however, these activities were recently transferred to another PDVSA
	affiliate.  Petrochemical feedstocks and
	industrial products are sold to various manufacturers and industrial companies
	across the United States.  Petroleum coke
	is sold essentially in international markets. 
	In 2004, CITGO sold a total of 26,811 millions gallons of petroleum
	products compared to 27,704 millions in the year 2003.




	 




	PDV Holding owns 50% of Chalmette Refining LLC
	(through PDV Chalmette) and 50% of Merey Sweeny L.P. (through PDV Sweeny).  These joint ventures with Exxon Mobil and
	ConocoPhillips, respectively, process crude oil in the United States.  PDVSA also owns 50% of Hovensa, a joint
	venture with Amerada Hess that processes crude oil in the U.S. Virgin
	Islands.  We are, through our U.S.
	subsidiaries, one of the largest refiners of crude oil in the United States,
	based on our aggregate net ownership interest in crude oil refining capacity at
	December 2004, equivalent to 1,205 MBPD.




	 




	Within Europe, we conduct our crude oil refining and
	refined petroleum product activities through PDV Europa, which owns our 50%
	interest in Ruhr, a company based in Germany and jointly owned with BP.  PDVSA also owns a 50% interest in Nynäs, a
	company with operations in Belgium, Sweden and the United Kingdom and jointly
	owned with Neste Oil, which currently owns Fortum Oil and Gas.  Through Ruhr, we refine crude oil and




	 




	10














	 




	market and transport gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil,
	petrochemicals, lubricants, asphalt and other refined petroleum products.  Through Nynäs, we refine crude oil and market
	and transport asphalt, specialty products, lubricants and other refined
	petroleum products.




	 




	In Venezuela we have been conducting our petrochemical
	activities mainly through Pequiven, which has three petrochemical complexes in
	Venezuela and 17 joint ventures with private sector partners.  However, as previously discussed, the
	Venezuelan Government decided in June 2005 to transfer Pequiven to the
	Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and Pequiven is currently evaluating the sale
	and transfer of its 17 joint ventures. 
	Nevertheless, PDVSA will supply the feedstocks required by Pequiven. See
	also Item 4.B Business overview  Marketing  Marketing in Venezuela 
	Petrochemicals.




	 




	The gas business is conducted by the previously
	mentioned divisions (east and west exploration and production divisions), while
	the gas downstream operations and LNG segments are conducted by PDVSA Gas.  CVP manages offshore gas natural projects.




	 




	Since 1997, Deltaven, a local retailing subsidiary,
	has marketed and distributed retail gasoline and other refined petroleum
	products in Venezuela, under the PDV brand. 
	Deltaven also is promoting the development of the commercial
	infrastructure and services for retail clients together with the private
	sector.




	 




	Furthermore, PDVSA Finance was established in 1998 to
	serve as our principal vehicle for corporate financing through the issuance of
	unsecured debt.




	 




	Another important subsidiary is Intevep, through which
	we manage our research and development activities.  PDVSA also has an educational center, CIED,
	which is responsible for the training and development of our personnel.  CIED is currently under a restructuring
	process to better suit current PDVSAs needs.




	 




	See Item 4.C Organizational structure for a list of
	our significant subsidiaries.




	 




	According to a comparative study published by
	Petroleum Intelligence Weekly on December 13, 2004, based on a combination
	of operating criteria and other data for 2003, such as: reserves, production,
	refining capacity and refined petroleum product sales, PDVSA is the worlds
	fourth largest vertically integrated oil and gas company, ranked fifth in the
	world in production, fifth in proved reserves of crude oil, fourth in refining
	capacity and eighth in product sales. 
	Venezuela has been exporting crude oil, primarily to the United States,
	continously since 1914.  At the end of
	2003, we exported to the US market approximately 1,183 MBPD of crude oil and
	petroleum products and by December 2004, we were exporting to the US
	market approximately 1,367 MBPD of crude oil and petroleum products.




	 




	The oil sector has a great impact on the Venezuelan
	economy.  In 2003, PDVSA accounted for
	approximately 18% of Venezuelan gross domestic product, 67% of its exports and
	57% of government revenues.  In 2004, PDVSA
	accounted for approximately 27% of Venezuelan gross domestic product, 83% of
	its exports and 48% of government revenues.




	 





	Business Strategy




	 



	Our business strategy is focused on the development of
	Venezuelas hydrocarbon resources on behalf of the country with the support of
	both national and foreign private capital. 
	This strategy aims to maximize the value of oil and gas resources and
	also to ensure our financial strength and stability, within the context of the
	dynamics of the energy market.  Since oil
	is a nonrenewable resource with an expected imbalance between oil demand and supply
	for the mid-term, we continue to participate actively in the world oil market
	in order to receive a fair and stable oil price.  Investments have to be made to avoid this
	expected imbalance, especially considering that it is predicted that an imbalance
	between the installed refining capacity and the market for refined products
	also exists.




	 




	This core strategy has been ratified in the 2005-2010
	Corporate Business Plan.




	 




	11














	 




	PDVSA plans to intensively invest in both upstream and
	downstream projects in order to satisfy the current and expected increasing
	energy demand.




	 




	According to this plan for 2005-2010, operations in
	Venezuela will focus on:




	 




	


	     

	The
	exploration of condensate, light and medium crude oil.  PDVSA financial resources will be mainly
	concentrated on the backyard areas.  All
	other exploration regions either onshore or offshore are opened for third party
	participation, under the umbrella of the Venezuelan Organic Hydrocarbon Law,
	Gaseous Hydrocarbon Organic Law and, of course, the National Constitution.



	 




	


	     

	The
	production and marketing of the heavy and extra-heavy crude oil, including the
	huge reserves in the Orinoco Belt. 
	According to the laws mentioned above, PDVSA is willing to develop new
	business opportunities with third parties in order to manufacture high quality
	products.



	 




	


	     

	The
	gas sector development.  PDVSA is
	planning thefast track development of this business segment with third party
	participation in either onshore or offshore and under the framework of
	Venezuelas Gaseous Hydrocarbon Law.



	 




	


	     

	In
	the downstream business we are looking for the right balance between our
	overseas and local assets in order to assure the domestic supply and quality
	for customers, in line with the strategy of maximizing the value of Venezuelan
	oil and gas resources.



	 




	


	     

	A
	new strategic objective consists of developing a sustainable social plan of
	large dimensions, aligned with the Social Plan of the Venezuelan
	Government.  PDVSAs social plan includes
	education, agricultural, infrastructure and local/regional development
	projects, which will generate about 1.7 million direct and indirect jobs and
	benefit 8.4 million people in Venezuela.



	 




	


	     

	We
	estimate that our business plan will require about $49 billion (excluding
	Pequiven) to achieve a sustainable production capacity of 5,109 MBPD by
	2010.  We expect to provide about 70% of
	the funds required for this Plan from our own resources and 30% by means of
	different financing sources.  The
	following chart shows a summary of actual and estimated capital expenditures:

	(1) 2005 includes $96 million for completion of the Orifuels
	Sinoven Joint Venture plant.




	(2) The 2004 expenditure corresponds to Pequiven.




	 




	We also are committed to maintaining high safety and
	health standards across all operations and we aim to achieve effective and
	timely integration of business technologies in our operational activities to
	develop a sustainable competitive advantage. 
	We also endeavor to provide quality training for our personnel; finally,
	the




	 




	12














	 




	business plan seeks to help to strengthen the national economy and to
	contribute to social programs such as education, healthcare and job creation.




	 




	We invested $2,990 million in operating assets in
	2004.  This expenditure was 42% lower
	than we had anticipated in our previous business plan.  This was due to technical difficulties
	resulting from sabotage against the Venezuelan oil industry in December 2002
	and the first quarter of 2003. 
	Additionally, in 2004 PDVSA expensed $4,355 million as a contribution to
	social programs in Venezuela.




	 




	Furthermore, we will support the process of Latin
	America and Caribbean energy and economic integration promoted by the
	Venezuelan Government.  We will also
	contribute effectively to put into practice the governmental initiative of
	building a new worldwide multipolar system of international relations based on
	justice, mutual respect and social equity. 
	This initiative will allow Venezuelan people to achieve a better
	standard of living with less poverty and sustainable development.




	 




	These new social commitments have not, to date,
	materially or adversely impacted PDVSA Petróleoss ability to generate the
	necessary flow of eligible receivables to support payments on our indebtedness.




	 




	As part of our business strategy, we intend to:




	 





	With respect to exploration, production and
	upgrading activities 





	 




	


	     

	incorporate
	reserves of light and medium gravity crude oil;



	 




	


	     

	increase our
	overall recovery factor;



	 




	


	     

	continue the
	development of our Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude oil projects; and



	 




	


	     

	leverage
	existing technology in order to maximize the return on our investments.



	 





	With respect to refining and marketing 





	 




	


	     

	assure product
	enhancement and environmental compliance in Venezuela and abroad;



	 




	


	     

	expand and
	diversify our markets into Latin America, Caribbean and Asia, including China
	and India; and



	 




	


	     

	improve the
	efficiency of our refining processes and marketing activities.



	 





	With respect to natural gas


	



	 




	


	     

	actively
	promote the national and international private sector participation in onshore
	and offshore non-associated gas reserves exploitation and processing;



	 




	


	     

	enhance our
	distribution processes in order to increase the breadth of our domestic and
	international markets; and



	 




	


	     

	assure
	participation in the liquified natural gas (LNG) markets.



	 





	With respect to petrochemicals 





	 




	


	     

	provide
	feedstocks and other raw material to Pequiven in a timely manner and continue
	to evaluate opportunities for petrochemical product development in our
	refineries abroad.



	 




	The execution of PDVSAs Corporate Plan includes the
	following initiatives or business:




	 




	13














	 




	


	     

	Exploration,
	production and upgrading.  The
	exploration and production strategy focuses on increasing our efforts to search
	for new light and medium gravity crude oil reserves and the systematic
	replacement of such reserves in back yard areas, developing new production
	areas, adjusting our production activities to cater market demands and
	agreements reached among OPEC members and other oil producing countries.  For this purpose we will acquire 4,150 Km of
	2D seismic lines, 20,593 Km

	2

	of 3D seismic lines and drill about 91
	exploratory wells.  PDVSA will drill some
	3,751 production wells and perform maintenance (Ra/Rc) on 7,663 wells, among
	other activities, in order to reach a production capacity of 5,109 MBPD by
	2010.  PDVSA is also making efforts to
	maintain competitive production costs by using state-of-the-art
	technology.  The first four Orinoco Belt
	projects have been completed and are in full operation: Hamaca (a PDVSA 
	ConocoPhillips & Chevron Texaco Joint Venture), Petrozuata (a joint
	venture between PDVSA and ConocoPhillips), Cerro Negro (a PDVSA  ExxonMobil 
	BP joint venture), Sincor (a PDVSA  TotalFina  Statoil joint venture).  These strategic alliances are currently
	producing more than 600 MBPD of heavy and extra-heavy crudes.  PDVSA will start a project to quantify and to
	certify proved hydrocarbons reserves in the Orinoco Belt, in order to determine
	the economic prospects and thus, properly direct future business in that area.



	 




	


	     

	Refining.  Our refining strategy focuses on improving
	the efficiency of our downstream operations. 
	In Venezuela, we will construct three new refineries: Cabruta (400
	MBPD), Barinas (50 MBPD) and Caripito (50 MBPD).  Also, we will add deep conversion capacity to
	the Puerto La Cruz, CRP (Amuay and Cardón) and El Palito refineries in order to
	increase the efficiency of heavy crude oil processing.  In our refineries in the United States,
	Europe and the Caribbean we will invest in order to comply with quality
	standards demanded by those markets. 
	Additionally, we will invest in the refineries of Kingston-Jamaica and
	Cienfuegos-Cuba, and develop a new refinery with Petrobras in the north of
	Brazil and in a deep conversion project in La Teja refinery in Uruguay.  We continue to aim to achieve a higher margin
	on refined petroleum products and to comply with all applicable environmental
	quality standards. (See Item 4.B. Business overview  Refining and Marketing).



	 




	


	     

	Marketing.  The plan considers continuing the expansion
	of our international marketing operations to ensure market share growth for our
	crude oil and refined petroleum products and to increase brand recognition for
	the products.  Also, we seek to diversify
	our customer portfolio by entering new markets such as China and India.  PDVSA will expand its operations in the
	Caribbean and South America through the Petroamerica initiative, which includes
	the Petrosur, Petrocaribe and Petroandina initiatives, in order to promote
	regional integration and a fair energy distribution among the Latin American
	nations.  We aim to maintain our market
	position in the U.S. through a more efficient distribution system of CITGO and
	its refined petroleum products.  CITGO
	International Latin America, Inc. CILA, which sells lubricants, gasoline
	and distillates in various Latin American countries, was recently transferred
	to Interven Venezuela and is currently evaluating the operation of its various
	subsidiaries. (See Item 4.B. Business overview  Refining and Marketing).  Additionally, in order to improve our
	logistic and marine transportation capabilities, PDVSA will construct 42
	tankers through strategic agreements with Argentina, Brazil, China and Spain,
	to increase from 21 to 58 the number of ships owned and operated by our
	subsidiary PDV Marina.



	 




	


	     

	In Venezuela,
	we plan to continue to promote a reliable supply of our products and the use of
	unleaded gasoline (a process started during the fourth quarter of 1999) to
	improve the competitive position of our network of service stations,
	lubrication centers and macro-stores, to continue the development of our commercial
	network through business relationships and other associations and to increase
	our product supply to high-traffic airports. 
	Also, we are developing an ethanol production project in order to
	substitute octane enhancement additives such as TEL and MTBE in the production
	of gasoline.  With the use of ethanol, we
	will have environmentally friendlier products and at the same time, we will be
	promoting agricultural and social development in rural areas, due to the fact that
	ethanol is produced from agricultural feedstocks such as sugarcane.



	 




	


	     

	Gas.  The development of the gas business is one of
	our major goals.  We plan to focus on
	creating attractive investment opportunities for the private sector in
	non-associated gas production, expanding



	 




	14














	 




	our
	transmission and distribution systems and natural gas liquids extraction,
	processing and fractioning capacity, and developing new gas export ventures,
	including exports of LNG.  We intend to
	operate most of the existing associated natural gas production fields,
	currently assigned to us by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum.  We will continue to explore and develop
	non-associated gas reserves with the support of private investment.  We expect to support the activities related
	to our gas business using our existing gas transmission and distribution
	systems.




	 




	


	     

	The Ministry of
	Energy and Mines, currently known as the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum,
	completed a round of onshore non-associated gas licensing bids for exploration
	and production activities in 11 new onshore areas in 2001.  Six of those areas were awarded to foreign
	and domestic investors:  Yucal-Placer
	Norte and Yucal-Placer Sur (both development areas), Barrancas, Tinaco, Tiznado
	and Barbacoas (each exploratory areas). 
	The Yucal-Placer areas produced 44 MMCFD in 2004, and approximately 300
	MMCFD are expected to be in production by 2010. 
	During the first quarter of 2003, the Venezuelan Government assigned two
	blocks within the Deltana Platform area (eastern Venezuela and on the maritime
	border with Trinidad & Tobago) to Statoil and ChevronTexaco and
	ConocoPhillips.  More recently it has
	assigned another block to ChevronTexaco. 
	Additionally, we have under way a new bidding round to explore and
	develop offshore resources in the west and northeast of Venezuela; such
	developments will principally include projects for the production of LNG, once
	the local demand in Venezuela has been satisfied.  We have defined an offshore natural gas
	project called Rafael Urdaneta located in the Venezuelan Gulf and northeast of
	Falcon State, with an area of 30,000 Km

	2

	, split into 29 blocks to be
	offered in two phases.  Phase one was
	initiated beginning the second quarter of 2005, when the Venezuelan Government
	offered the first six blocks to 37 national and foreign oil companies.  Of this offer, blocks Urumaco I and II were
	awarded to the Russian company Gazprom, while block Cardon III was awarded to
	ChevronTexaco.



	 




	


	     

	We anticipate
	that development of our gas business segment will require approximately $9
	billion in capital from 2005 to 2010.  We
	expect that such capital expenditures will be obtained primarily from the
	private sector, including partners.



	 




	


	     

	We believe that
	our natural gas resources and Venezuelas geographical location at the center
	of the Atlantic Basin puts us in an advantageous position to achieve our goals
	by 2010.  We intend to capitalize on our
	advantages by promoting an increased and more diverse use of natural gas within
	the country.



	 




	


	     

	At this time,
	the Orimulsion® production is operated just to meet the needs of our clients in
	Europe, Asia and the United States. 
	During 2003 we conducted a full review of this business.  The outcome of such analysis showed that a
	reevaluation of our strategy was necessary within the framework of the new
	Corporate Strategy in order to maximize the value of Venezuelan natural
	resources.  Since that reassessment, we
	produce only enough Orimulsion® to comply with our existing contracts.  A new production module (Sinovensa) will be
	in place by the end of 2005 in order to supply the existing agreements.



	 





	Exploration and Production




	 



	Venezuelas proved crude oil reserves have continued
	to increase over the years, with a cumulative production of crude oil from 1914
	through December 31, 2003 totaling approximately 56.7 billion
	barrels.  Venezuelas commercial
	production of crude oil is concentrated in the Western Zulia Basin and the
	Western Barinas  Apure Basin in Western Venezuela and in the Monagas and
	Anzoategui states in the Eastern Basin. 
	The large number of fields in production in these three basins are
	broadly distributed geographically and, as a result, substantially diversifies
	our production risk.  The impact of a
	loss of production in any one field would be relatively minor when compared to
	Venezuelas total production.  The
	Western and Eastern basins have produced 41.0 billion and 15.7 billion barrels,
	respectively, of crude oil to date. 
	Substantial portions of the sedimentary basins in Venezuela have not yet
	been explored.

	Reserves





	 



	We use geological and engineering data to estimate our
	proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, including proved developed and
	undeveloped reserves.  Such data is
	capable of demonstrating with reasonable certainty whether such reserves are
	recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
	operating conditions.  We expect to
	recover proved crude oil and natural gas reserves principally from new wells and
	acreage that has not been drilled using currently available equipment and
	operating methods.  Our estimates of
	reserves are not precise and are subject to revision.  We review these crude oil and natural gas
	reserves annually to take into account, among other things, production levels,
	field reviews, the addition of new reserves from discoveries, year-end prices
	and economic and other factors.  Proved
	reserve estimates may be materially different from the quantities of crude oil
	and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.




	 




	Crude oil and natural gas represented 75% and 25%,
	respectively, of our total estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves
	on an oil equivalent basis at December 31, 2003.




	 





	Crude Oil


	.  We had estimated proved crude oil reserves at
	December 31, 2003 totaling approximately 77.1 billion barrels (including
	an estimated 35.2 billion barrels of heavy, extra-heavy crude oil and bitumen
	in the Orinoco Belt).  We also had
	estimated proved reserves of natural gas totaling approximately 150,043 BCF
	(including an estimated 12,427 BCF in the Orinoco Belt).  The average API gravity of our estimated
	proved crude oil reserves was 17.3° as compared to an average API gravity of
	23° for our crude oil produced in 2002; the API gravity of the up-graded oil
	produced by the Orinoco Belt projects ranges from 16° to 32°.  Based on 2003 production levels, estimated
	proved reserves of crude oil, including heavy and extra-heavy crude oil
	reserves that will require significant future development costs to produce and
	refine, have a remaining life of approximately 74 years.



	 




	From December 31, 1995 to December 31, 2003,
	our estimated proved reserves of crude oil increased by 10.8 billion barrels
	and our estimated proved reserves of natural gas increased by 1.12 billion
	barrels of oil equivalent (BOE).  In
	2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, our proved crude oil reserve replacement ratio was
	100%, 104%, 108% and 169%, respectively. 
	These variations resulted from revisions to the expected recovery rate
	of oil in place and the application of secondary recovery technology to
	existing crude oil deposits.




	 





	Natural Gas


	.  We have substantial proved developed reserves
	of natural gas amounting to 150,043 BCF (or 25,869 MMBOE) at December 31,
	2003.  Our natural gas reserves are
	comprised of associated gas that is developed incidental to the development of
	our crude oil reserves.  A large
	proportion of our proved natural gas reserves are developed.  During 2003, approximately 42% of the natural
	gas that we produced was reinjected for well pressure maintenance purposes.



	 




	The following table shows our proved crude oil and
	natural gas reserves and proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves,
	all located in Venezuela (See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements,
	included under Item 18.  Financial

	New Hydrocarbon Reserves Findings




	 



	In 2003, the Eastern PDVSA Division discovered new
	hydrocarbon reserves of approximately 159 million barrels of crude oil and
	1,675 BCF of associated gas. 
	Specifically in the North-East of Monagas State, near to Maturín well
	CHL-6X was discovered with 47 million barrels of crude oil and 350 BCF of
	associated gas. Currently, we are in the process of drilling the exploratory
	well CHL-7X, located near to well CHL-6X, with estimated hydrocarbon reserves
	of 255 million barrels of crude oil and 1,300 BCF of associated gas.  In the North West of Monagas State, at the
	Tacata Field, the well TAC-2X with 118 million barrels of crude oil and 2,457
	BCF




	 




	19














	 




	of associated gas was discovered. 
	Further exploration activities include wells TAG-19 and TRAVI ESTE 1X in
	progress, with estimated reserves of 191 million barrels of crude oil and 629
	BCF of associated gas.




	 




	In the Western part of the country, we continue our
	exploration activities at Franquera, Pauji and Misoa Formations of Eocene.  Currently, we are drilling the Franquera 1-X
	exploratory well and we expect this reservoir to yield new reserves of 789
	million barrels of crude oil and 378 BCF of associated gas.




	 





	Operations




	 



	We maintain an active exploration and development
	program designed to increase our proved crude oil reserves and production
	capacity.  We have been successful in our
	efforts to increase our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves in each of
	the last 20 years.  Beginning in 1992, we
	commenced a program designed to attract and incorporate private sector
	participation into our exploration and production activities.  We currently conduct our exploration and
	development activities in the Western Zulia Basin, the Western Barinas  Apure
	Basin and the Eastern Basin in the Monagas and Anzoátegui states.  We are currently conducting extensive
	exploration and development activities in the Orinoco Belt of the Eastern Basin
	and in the other basins, either independently or together with foreign partners
	through joint ventures.  See Item 4.B
	Business overviewInitiatives Involving Private Sector Participation.




	 




	In 2003, our exploration expenditures were used mainly
	to fund the drilling of 7 exploratory wells and the acquisition of 280 square
	kilometers of 3D seismic lines.  No
	additional exploratory wells were drilled and no seismic lines were acquired
	pursuant to our operating service agreements. 
	250 MMB proved crude oil reserves were added in 2003 (162 MMB from newly
	discovered reserves and 88 MMB from development wells) compared to 238 MMB in
	2002 (135 MMB from newly discovered reserves and 103 MMB from development
	wells), 357 MMB in 2001 (46 MMB from newly discovered reserves and 311 MMB from
	development wells) 209 MMB in 2000 (5 MMB from newly discovered reserves and
	204 MMB from development wells) and 184 MMB in 1999 (84 MMB from newly
	discovered reserves and 100 MMB from developed wells) (These proved crude oil
	reserves do not include extensions of existing reserves, secondary extractions,
	or other factors.  See note 23(a) to
	the financial statements, included under Item 18. Financial Statements).  In 2003, we invested $526 million in 206
	development wells and other facilities.

	Pursuant to the Orinoco Belt Extra-heavy Crude Oil
	Projects, no exploration wells and 64 development wells were drilled in 2003,
	17 exploration wells and 144 development wells were drilled in 2002, 9
	exploration wells and 349 development wells were drilled in 2001 and 15
	exploration wells and 453 development wells were drilled in 2000.




	 




	In 2003, our crude oil production averaged 2,451 MBPD
	(including 122 MBPD attributable to our participation in the Orinoco Belt
	projects) with API gravity between 16° and 32°. 
	This production level represented approximately 69% of PDVSAs estimated
	2003 year end crude oil production capacity of 3,529 MBPD (including 525 MBPD
	of crude oil production capacity attributable to our Orinoco Belt
	projects).  During 2003, our average
	production costs of crude oil was approximately $3.85 per BOE, or $2.06 per BOE
	excluding the production and costs attributable to our operating service
	agreements, and the average of our depreciation and depletion costs was $0.53
	per BOE.  See Item 3.A Selected
	financial data.




	 




	At December 31, 2003, we operated approximately
	15,782 oil wells.  At such date, we had
	37,659 gross kms

	2

	of undeveloped acreage and 177,829 gross kms

	2

	of acreage under development, including 49,194 kms

	2

	developed
	pursuant to our operating service agreements.




	 




	On average, during 2003, our natural gas production
	was 5,938 MMCFD (or 1,024 MBPD on an oil equivalent basis), of which 2,506
	MMCFD, or 42%, was reinjected for purposes of maintaining reservoir
	pressure.  The net natural gas production
	of 3,432 MMCFD was consumed in production of LNG (9%), as fuel in refinery and
	production operations (24%), in petrochemical operations (14%) and the
	remainder (53%) is sold to third parties for power generation, aluminum, iron
	and other manufacturing industries and domestic uses.  Approximately 70% of the 2003 natural gas
	production and 76% of the total estimated proved net natural gas reserves are
	located in the Eastern Basin.  A
	significant portion of this production is transported through our pipeline
	systems for use by industries in the coastal and central regions of Venezuela.

	The combined average

	gas), is calculated by dividing the sum of all direct and indirect production
	costs (including our own consumption but not including depreciation and

	Initiatives Involving Private Sector
	Participation




	 



	As part of the process encouraging private initiatives
	and investment in the oil industry, and pursuant to Article 5 of the
	Nationalization Law, with the approval of the National Congress, we are
	permitted to enter into operating and association agreements with private
	entities.  Since 1992, we have undertaken
	projects with the private sector in connection with our exploration and
	development activities.




	 




	In August 2003, to streamline our business
	operations and reduce our administrative costs, the administration of our
	business ventures with private sector entities was assigned to our subsidiary,
	CVP.  In this regard, CVP assumed
	administrative responsibility within PDVSA with respect to our operating
	service agreements, strategic associations and profit sharing agreements
	described below.  In addition to its
	administrative responsibilities, CVP will continue to promote PDVSAs relations
	with third parties and private sector participation in the petroleum
	industry.  However, any dividends and
	profits from production activities conducted pursuant to our operating service
	agreements and our other strategic associations continue to be paid to PDVSA,
	except for dividends from our profit sharing agreements, which are paid to CVP.

	Operating Service Agreements





	 



	During 1992, 1993 and 1997, PDVSA auctioned the rights
	to and entered into agreements with several international companies.  The purpose of these agreements was to
	reactivate the operation of thirty-three oil fields which no longer met our minimum
	rate of return on investment threshold, using secondary and tertiary recovery
	techniques.  The auctions conducted
	during 1992 and 1993 are referred to in this annual report as the first and
	second rounds and the auction conducted in 1997 is referred to in this annual
	report as the third round.




	 




	The terms of the operating agreements entered into
	require the international oil company investors to make capital investments in
	the form of assets necessary to increase production in the relevant oil fields.  These investors would then recover their
	investments by collecting operating fees and stipends from PDVSA, amounts to be
	determined based on pricing formulas derived from the amount of crude oil
	delivered to PDVSA during the term of the operating agreement.  The operating agreements also provide that
	PDVSA would own the capital assets employed in the production, retain title to
	the hydrocarbons produced and have no further obligations as to any remaining
	value of the assets existing in the fields. 
	See note 10(c) to our consolidated financial statements, included
	under Item 18.  Financial Statements.




	 




	


	     



	The First and Second Rounds


	. 
	A total of 27 oil companies (grouped in different consortiums) were
	awarded rights to drill 15 oil fields. 
	Since then, some companies have changed their participation in the
	different consortiums.  In 2003, Anadarko
	bought the participation of Union Pacific in the Oritupano-Leona field;
	ExxonMobil bought the participation of Ampolex in Quiamare-La Ceiba field and
	Repsol-YPF bought the participation of Union Pacific in the West Falcon
	field.  An average of 313 MBPD of crude
	oil was produced from these fields in 2003, and it is expected that such
	production will be approximately 405 MBPD when the fields are in substantially full
	operation by 2005.  As of December 31,
	2003, these fields had estimated proved reserves of approximately 3.83 billion
	barrels of crude oil.  Under this
	initiative, foreign companies have invested $5,535 million since 1992.

	The Third Round


	.  We
	auctioned the right to reactivate, rehabilitate, develop and additionally
	explore certain hydrocarbon reservoirs in 18 fields, one of which is currently
	inactive.  In 2003, ENI bought the
	participation of Lasmo in the Dación field. 
	An average of 150 MBPD of crude oil was produced from these fields in
	2003.  As of December 31, 2003,
	these fields had estimated proved reserves of approximately 1.62 billion
	barrels of crude oil.  Our business plan
	currently contemplates daily production from these fields of 225 MBPD by 2005
	under our operating service agreements. 
	Under this initiative, the operator companies have invested $3,548
	million since 1997.

	These proved crude oil
	reserves correspond to the fields assigned to each of the operating service
	agreements and are included in our total proved crude oil reserves.  Such operating service agreements will not
	necessarily result in the exploitation of 100% of those reserves during their
	term.  See Item 4.B Business
	overviewExploration and ProductionReserves. 
	The proved reserves disclosed at December 31, 2003 do not include
	any additional reserves which may ultimately be proved based on recovery
	projects to be implemented by the operators of the service agreements.




	 




	During 2005, the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum has
	instructed PDVSA to convert the Operating Service Agreements to a scheme of
	jointly owned enterprises, where PDVSA will hold a minimum of 51% stock
	ownership, according to the Organic Hydrocarbons Law of Venezuela.  CVP is analyzing each Operating Service
	Agreement and by the end of 2005, CVP is expecting to complete the conversion
	process.




	 






	Exploration and Production in New Areas under Profit Sharing Agreements





	 



	In July 1995, the Venezuelan Congress approved
	profit sharing arrangements pursuant to which private sector oil companies were
	offered the right to explore, drill and develop light and medium crude oil, on
	an equity basis in ten designated blocks with a total area of 13,774 square
	kilometers, pursuant to the terms of the profit sharing agreements entered into
	by such companies and CVP, our subsidiary appointed to coordinate, control and
	supervise these agreements.  Under the
	profit sharing agreements, CVP has the right to participate, at its option,
	with an ownership interest of between 1% and 35% in the development of any
	recoverable reserves with commercial potential. 
	Eight oil fields were awarded to 14 companies in 1996.  The awards were based on the percentage of
	pretax earnings ranging up to 50% that the bidders were willing to share with
	the Venezuelan government.  Our business
	plan currently contemplates an aggregate average daily production from the
	fields in these new areas of 460 MBPD by 2010. 
	The profit sharing agreements provide for the creation of a Control
	Committee, as the ultimate authority for approval and control, and which shall
	make fundamental decisions of national interest for Venezuela in connection
	with the execution of these agreements.




	 




	In 2003, these companies invested approximately $55
	million in activities related to the discovery, well evaluation, development
	and exploration efforts in Eastern Paria Gulf, La Ceiba and particularly in
	Western Paria Gulf, where the commercial stage of production has been
	reached.  See note 10(b) to our
	consolidated financial statements, included under Item 18.  Financial Statements.




	 




	CVP is entitled to hold shares representing a maximum
	of 35% participation in the joint ventures that could be formed pursuant to
	profit sharing agreements in the following oil fields:

	The profit sharing agreement with Punta Pescador was
	terminated in 2000, and agreements with Guanare, Guarapiche and Delta Centro
	were terminated in 2001.  The San Carlos
	agreement was converted into a gas license in 2002.




	 




	A recent evaluation plan confirmed large hydrocarbon
	and gas reserves in the Western Paria Gulf field.  It is anticipated that the field contains
	over two billion barrels of crude oil. 
	On April 3, 2003, we approved phase I of the development plan for
	this field, involving a capital investment of approximately $557 million by
	investors and an expected production level of 250 million barrels of crude oil
	over the next 20 years.  Phase I of this
	development will be conducted using a wellhead platform, a floating production
	unit with a separate accommodations platform, pipeline to a floating storage
	offtake vessel (FSO), and a mooring buoy for loading arriving tankers.  Phase I also will include water injection for
	pressure maintenance.  The produced
	associated gas will be stored in an aquifer zone wholly contained within the
	overall Corocoro gas column.  The
	operator will manage the facilities design, construction installation and
	subsequent production operations.  A
	total of 24 wells will be drilled comprising 11 producers, 10 water injectors,
	2 gas injectors and one utility well.  We
	estimate an average production of 55 MBPD in 2005, increasing to 120 MBPD in or
	after 2008.




	 




	It is currently projected that phase II (expected to
	commence in 2008) would involve a further $487 million of investments to
	recover additional reserves of up to 450 million barrels of crude oil from the
	field.  We believe that we can make an
	efficient transition from phase I to phase II by using existing production
	facilities in the second phase.  The
	total project cost for phase I and phase II is estimated at $4.3 per barrel,
	comprising $2.3 per barrel for development and $2.0 per barrel for operations.




	 




	In 2002 we invested $2.8 million for exploratory
	activities related to the Western Paria Gulf field.  Additionally, in 2003 we drilled four
	development wells in that field, which required a total investment of $7.8
	million.  In the La Ceiba field we began
	drilling wells La Ceiba 3X and La Ceiba 6X and, depending on the evaluation of
	the results of those wells, a declaration of commercial operation will be issued
	to then begin the construction of production facilities to handle the early
	crude oil production, with an estimated investment of approximately $11
	million.




	 






	Orinoco Belt Extra-Heavy Crude Oil Projects





	 



	The Venezuelan Congress approved the creation of four
	vertically integrated joint venture projects in the Orinoco Belt for the
	exploitation and upgrading of extra-heavy crude oil of average API gravity of
	9° and marketing of the upgraded crude oil with API gravities ranging from 16°
	to 32°.  These joint venture projects
	have been implemented through association agreements between the various
	participating entities and PDVSA.  The
	term of each association agreement is approximately 35 years after commencement
	of commercial production, and, upon termination, the foreign participants
	ownership is transferred to PDVSA.  Each
	of the projects is assigned an area that is expected to contain sufficient
	recoverable extra-heavy oil to meet planned output during the life of the
	association.  For the foreign partners,
	the projects represent a significant opportunity to increase production and
	proved crude oil reserves.  For us, the
	projects represent an opportunity to develop the Orinoco Belts extra-heavy
	crude oil reserves.




	 




	Each of these associations are required to pay the
	standard Venezuelan corporate tax rate of 34% (as compared to a tax rate of 50%
	that is applicable to our Venezuelan subsidiaries engaged in the production of
	hydrocarbons).  In addition, they pay a
	production tax ranging between 1% to 16 2/3%, measured depending on accumulated
	revenues and total investment.  These tax
	conditions were modified in October 2004. 
	See note 23(a) to our consolidated financial statements, included
	under Item 18.  Financial Statements.  Also, these strategic associations benefit
	from a 10% investment tax credit on capital investments made after December 31,
	2001, plus an additional 10% on capital investments that contribute to the
	environmental preservation of their operational areas.




	 




	The four joint venture projects in the Orinoco Belt
	are as follows:




	 




	


	     



	The Petrozuata Joint Venture


	.  Petrozuata is a company owned by PDVSA
	Petróleo (a subsidiary of PDVSA) and ConocoPhillips.  The construction of facilities at Petrozuata
	began in 1997.  Initial production of
	extra-heavy crude oil commenced in August 1998.  Upgraded facilities were completed



	 




	26














	 




	in
	2001.  During 2003, Petrozuata produced
	104 MBPD of extra-heavy crude oil and 86 MBPD of upgraded crude oil with an
	average API gravity ranging from 16° to 24°. 
	Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, ConocoPhillips has
	agreed to undertake the refining process at its Lake Charles refinery, in Lake
	Charles, Louisiana.  By December 2003,
	total investments in this project amounted to $3,478 million.




	 




	


	     



	The Sincor Joint Venture


	. 
	Sincrudos de Oriente is a joint venture owned by PDVSA Sincor (a
	subsidiary of PDVSA), TotalFina and Statoil. 
	In 2003, this joint venture produced 158 MBPD of extra-heavy crude oil
	and 137 MBPD of upgraded crude oil with an average API gravity ranging from 24°
	to 32°.  We anticipate that this joint
	venture will reach a production level of 180 MBPD of upgraded crude oil by
	2007.  By December 2003, total
	investments in this project amounted to $4,654 million.



	 




	


	     



	The Hamaca Joint Venture


	. 
	Petrolera Hamaca is a company owned by Corpoguanipa (a subsidiary of
	PDVSA), ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips. 
	Hamaca started producing upgraded crude oil in October 2004,
	achieving by the end of that year a production of 101 MBPD, with an average API
	gravity of 25° to 27°.  In 2003, average
	production of extra-heavy crude oil was 67 MBPD and average production of
	diluted crude oil was 125 MBPD with an average gravity of 16° API.  By December 2003, total investments in
	this project amounted to $2,544 million, of which, $472 million was invested in
	2003.



	 




	


	     



	The Cerro Negro Joint Venture


	.  Petrolera Cerro Negro is a company owned by
	PDVSA Cerro Negro, S.A. (a subsidiary of PDVSA), ExxonMobil and BP (formerly
	Veba Oel).  Pursuant to the terms of this
	joint venture agreement, we have agreed to sell our share of upgraded crude oil
	produced by this joint venture (approximately 80% of total production) to
	Chalmette Refining, a refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, which is an equal share
	joint venture between PDVSA and ExxonMobil. 
	During 2003, this joint venture produced 101 MBPD of extra-heavy crude
	oil and 92 MBPD of upgraded crude oil with an average API gravity of 16°.  By December 2003, total investments in
	this project amounted to $2,823 million. 
	See Item 4.B Business overviewRefining and MarketingRefining and
	note 10(a) to our consolidated financial statements, included under Item
	18.  Financial Statements.



	 




	The Orinoco Belt projects differ primarily by the
	quantity and quality of output.  For the
	Hamaca and Sincor joint ventures, the projects are designed to produce upgraded
	crude oil that can be sold to third-party refiners who would otherwise process
	light sweet conventional crude oil.  For
	the Petrozuata and Cerro Negro joint ventures, the projects are designed to
	produce upgraded crude oil that is suitable for a dedicated refinery.




	 




	The following table sets forth for each association in
	the Orinoco Belt, the parties estimated proved reserves in the areas associated
	with the projects and estimated production:

	Operating Service Agreement with National Universities






	 




	In October 2000, we entered into operating
	service agreements with three National Universities:  Universidad de Oriente (Eastern University),
	Universidad del Zulia (Zulia University), and Universidad Central de Venezuela
	(Central University of Venezuela).  In
	these agreements, we auctioned the right to reactivate, rehabilitate and
	develop fields located in three geographical areas.  The purpose of these agreements with the
	National Universities is to provide training and industry experience to
	Venezuelan university students, especially geophysics, petroleum engineers and
	geology students.




	 




	Each field will be developed by separate entities that
	are 51% owned by us and 49% owned by the respective universities.  These fields are:  Socororo, located in Anzoátegui State,
	operated by Petroucv, S.A., with an assigned surface of 257 square Km; Mara
	Este, located in the Zulia State, operated by Oleoluz, S.A., with an assigned
	surface of 246 square Km; and Jobo, located in Monagas State, operated by
	Petroudo, S.A. with an assigned surface of 19.57 square Km.  The total assigned area for all these fields
	is approximately 523 square kilometers. 
	As of December 31, 2003, these fields have estimated proved
	reserves of approximately 234 MMB of crude oil (consisting of 50.5 MMB at
	Socororo, 69.3 MMB at Mara Este and 114.2 MMB at Jobo, respectively), with an
	average API gravity of 8° to 22° API. 
	During 2003, the total oil production under these operating service
	agreements was 2.5 MBPD.  We expect these
	fields to produce approximately 35 MBPD by 2007.  We also anticipate investing a total of
	approximately $202 million in these fields over the next 20 years.  By December 2004, total expenditures
	amounted to $25.8 million.




	 





	Overview of Main Projects with Private Sector
	Participation




	 





	The Plataforma Deltana Project





	 



	The Plataforma Deltana area is located 250 km offshore
	East of the Orinoco River Delta and Southeast of the territorial border with
	the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad and Tobago).  For bidding and business purposes, the zone
	has been divided into five blocks mainly prospective for non-associated
	gas.  The main objective of the project
	is to confirm and develop new non-associated natural gas reserves to meet
	domestic market requirements as well as for export, mainly to the Atlantic
	Basin.




	 




	The first exploration phase, with disbursement
	amounting to $180 million, was completed by PDVSA on July 9, 2003 in an
	area of 1,000 square kilometers next to the territorial border with Trinidad &
	Tobago.  Such exploration activity
	resulted in an increase of the non-associated natural gas reserves estimates to
	5.6 Trillion cubic feet as audited by the specialized firm Ryder Scott.  A 10 TCF short term proven reserves objective
	is being considered as part of the second exploratory phase being executed in
	the period 2004-2005 by the companies working in the area under the granted
	licenses, to assure the commercial development of the Plataforma Deltana
	area.  Total investment in this project
	has been estimated at approximately $4 billion.




	 




	Licenses for exploration and development for blocks 2
	and 4 were granted by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to three
	international oil and gas companies in February 2003 (ChevronTexaco and
	ConocoPhillips in Block 2 and Statoil in Block 4).  The international companies are committed to
	a minimum exploratory program, with an estimated investment of $150 million
	(drilling activities started in August 2004), and to subsequent
	investments for development if commercial viability is confirmed.  PDVSAs participation in the partnership,
	which could range from 1% to 35%, will be determined upon declaration of
	commercial viability.




	 




	The selection process of partners for block 3 was
	completed in 2003.  In February 2004
	the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum granted the license for exploration and
	development to ChevronTexaco.  Block 1 is
	reserved for business opportunities, subject to an unitization agreement with
	Trinidad and Tobago.  On August 2003
	a memorandum of understanding was signed between the two countries to manage
	all common reservoirs along the territorial border.  The exploratory program for this block will
	cost approximately $27 million. Block 5 remains for future growth
	opportunities.




	 




	The natural gas produced offshore will be processed
	onshore in a new industrial complex to be located near the city of Guiria, in
	Sucre State in the North East of Venezuela. 
	It is planned that this industrial complex will also




	 




	28














	 




	serve the LNG Mariscal Sucre and other gas projects in the region.  The application of international health,
	safety and environment standards and sustainable development practices are key
	strategies for the development of this area. 
	This project will contribute to Venezuelas natural gas business
	expansion, and will further diversify the countrys energy sources.




	 






	Mariscal Sucre Project





	 



	The main purpose of this project is the development of
	North Paria fields, at the North East of Venezuela to produce non-associated
	natural gas to supply both local and international markets. The project
	involves production of 1,070 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMCFD);
	the construction of a gas liquefaction train with a design capacity of 4.7
	million metric tons per year (MMTY).  As
	a reference, one of the development scenarios for the four Mariscal Sucre
	Projects fields consist of a total of 45 reservoirs that are going to be
	drained with 36 wells and drilled in 4 development phases over a period of
	about 20 years.




	 




	The first drilling phase comprises 14 platform wells 
	average of 31 days to drill and 14 days to complete if no downhole chemical
	injection is needed  and will all be completed with the use of a deepwater
	cantilever jack-up rig.  The initial
	wells will be at Río Caribe (6 wells) and Mejillones (8 wells) from four
	platforms.  The Central Production
	Facility (CPF) for the entire development will be located at Mejillones and
	initially, it will gather all production. 
	The export pipeline will initiate from this platform, and the offshore
	central control room will be located on this structure.  There are no processing facilities on the
	CPF.  The gas, condensate, and produced
	water will be routed to the LNG plant at Güiria by a multi-phase export
	pipeline.  All platforms will contain
	power generation and associated utilities.




	 




	Estimated initial production will be 17,000 BPD of
	stabilized condensate from Rio Caribe and 1,070 MMCFD of gas from all
	fields.  During this phase, the bulk of
	condensate will come from Rio Caribe.




	 




	The total estimated investment is $2,700 million.  First stage activities include basic
	services, dock services, port services, general services, corridors services,
	roads and security, residential area and relocation of city airport.




	 





	Refining and Marketing




	 





	Refining





	 



	Our downstream strategy has been focused on the
	expansion and upgrading of our refining operations in Venezuela, the United
	States and Europe, allowing us to increase our production of refined petroleum
	products and upgrade our product slate toward higher-margin refined petroleum
	products.  We have also increased the
	complexity of our refining capacity in Venezuela and made extensive investments
	to convert our worldwide refining assets from simple conversion to deep
	conversion capabilities.  Deep conversion
	capabilities in our Venezuelan refineries have enabled us to improve yields by
	allowing a greater percentage of higher value products to be produced.  Such capabilities have resulted in an increase
	in our gasoline and distillate yield from 35% in 1976 to 70% in 2003, and has
	allowed us to reduce our fuel oil production from 60% to 23% during the same
	period, resulting in an improved export product portfolio.




	 




	We conduct refining activities in Venezuela, the
	Caribbean, the United States and Europe. 
	Our net interest in refining capacity has grown from 2,362 MBPD in 1991
	to 3,092 MBPD at December 31, 2003.

	In order to maintain our competitiveness within
	international markets, we expect to invest approximately $14,133 million from
	2005 through 2010 in Venezuela to improve our refining systems and to adapt our
	systems to meet environmental regulations and domestic and international
	product quality requirements.  The
	refining plan includes projects aimed at manufacturing gasoline.  On March 13, 2001, we entered into a
	contract for approximately $300 million with a Venezuelan-Japanese Consortium
	led by the Japanese JGC Corporation (formed by the Japanese Chiyoda Corporation
	and the Venezuelan companies, Jantesa and Vepica) to construct naphtha
	hydrotreating facilities and diesel hydro-desulphurization and environmental
	units in a refinery located in Puerto La Cruz, referred to in this annual
	report as the VALCOR project.  The
	primary objective of this project was to produce unleaded gasoline to meet the
	demands of the local market and to produce distillates of low sulphur content
	for export to international markets.




	 




	The facilities and processing units were completed in December 2004
	at a cost of $545 million.  VALCOR is currently
	in production mode, producing 45 MBPD of gasoline and 30 MBPD of diesel
	blending components.




	 




	Additionally, the two fluid catalytic cracking units
	located at our Amuay and Cardón refineries (Paraguaná Refining Complex - PRC),
	are being modified to manufacture more gasoline.  A low sulfur gasoline production unit
	(currently in the engineering phase) based on our own technology (ISAL®
	developed by Intevep, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA) is expected to be operational
	in the Amuay refinery by 2006 and another similar unit will be installed at the
	Isla refinery in Curacao sometime in the refining plan period.  We also plan to increase the heavy crude
	refining capacity, and we foresee the expansion of our delayed coking plants
	located at the refining complex in Paraguaná, Venezuela, and we are also
	performing studies to increase Venezuelas refining capacity.




	 





	Venezuela and the Caribbean




	 



	Our refineries in Venezuela are located at
	Amuay-Cardón (PRC), Puerto La Cruz, El Palito, Bajo Grande and San Roque, with
	rated crude oil refining capacities of 635- 305 MBPD, 203 MBPD, 130 MBPD, 15
	MBPD and 5 MBPD, respectively.  We also
	operate the Isla Refinery in Curaçao, which we lease on a long-term basis from
	the Netherlands-Antilles government.  The
	lease expires in 2019.  Through these
	refineries, we produce reformulated gasoline and distillates to meet the U.S.
	and other international market requirements.




	 





	United States




	 



	Through our wholly owned subsidiary, CITGO, we produce
	light fuels and petrochemicals primarily through our refineries in Lake
	Charles, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Lemont, Illinois.  Our asphalt refining operations are carried
	out through refineries in Paulsboro, New Jersey; and Savannah, Georgia.




	 




	31














	 




	CITGOs largest supplier of crude oil is PDVSA.  CITGO has entered into long-term crude oil
	supply agreements with PDVSA with respect to the crude oil requirements for
	each of CITGOs Lake Charles, Corpus Christi, Paulsboro and Savannah refineries.  These crude oil supply agreements require
	PDVSA to supply minimum quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks to CITGO,
	usually from 20 to 25 years.  These crude
	supply agreements contain force majeure provisions that entitle the supplier to
	reduce the quantity of crude oil and feedstocks delivered under the crude
	supply agreements under specified circumstances.




	 




	The Lake Charles refinery has a rated refining
	capacity of 320 MBPD and is capable of processing large volumes of heavy crude
	oil into a flexible slate of refined products, including significant quantities
	of high-octane unleaded gasoline and reformulated gasoline.  A project to increase the crude oil
	distillation capacity by 105 MBPD was completed and became operative by February 2005,
	so this refinery is currently the fourth largest in the U.S. with a total
	refining capacity of 425 MBPD.  The Lake
	Charles refinerys main petrochemical products are propylene, benzene and mixed
	xylenes.  Its industrial products include
	sulphur, residual fuels and petroleum coke. 
	This refinery has one of the highest capacity levels for higher
	value-added products production in the United States, with a multiple stream
	capacity that allows it to continue operating with one or more units shut
	down.  This refinery has a Solomon
	Process Complexity Rating of 18.2 (as compared to an average of 14.0 for U.S.
	refineries in Solomon Associates, Inc.s most recently available
	survey).  The Solomon Process Complexity
	Rating is an industry measure of a refinerys ability to produce higher value
	products.  A higher Solomon Process
	Complexity Rating indicates a greater capability to produce such products.




	 




	The Corpus Christi refinery has a refining capacity of
	157 MBPD and a processing technology that enables it to produce premium grades
	of gasoline that exceed that of most of its U.S. competitors and to reduce
	sulfur levels in refined petroleum products. 
	This refinery has a Solomon Process Complexity Rating of 16.5.  The Corpus Christi refinerys main
	petrochemical products include cumene, cyclohexane, and aromatics (including
	benzene, toluene and xylenes).




	 




	The Lemont refinery processes heavy crude oil into a
	flexible slate of refined products.  The
	refinery has a rated refining capacity of 167 MBPD and has a Solomon Process
	Complexity Rating of 11.7.  This refinery
	is one of the most recently designed and constructed refineries in the United
	States.  It is a flexible deep conversion
	facility that produces primarily gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and petrochemicals.




	 




	The refineries in Paulsboro, New Jersey and Savannah,
	Georgia are specialized asphalt refineries. 
	The Paulsboro refinery, which is particularly suited to processing
	asphalt, also has facilities to process low sulfur, light crude oil whenever
	favorable conditions exist.




	 




	Through LYONDELL-CITGO, a joint venture owned 41.25%
	by PDVSA and 58.75% by Lyondell, we have a net interest in refining capacity of
	109 MBPD in a refinery located in Houston, Texas with a refining capacity of
	265 MBPD.  PDVSA supplies a substantial amount
	of the crude oil processed by this refinery under a long-term crude oil supply
	agreement that expires in the year 2017. 
	Under this agreement, LYONDELL-CITGO purchased approximately $1.7
	billion of crude oil and feedstocks at market related prices from PDVSA in
	2003.  CITGO purchases substantially all
	of the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel produced at this refinery under a
	long-term contract.




	 




	Various disputes exist between LYONDELL-CITGO and its
	partners and their respective affiliates concerning the interpretation of
	agreements between the parties relating to the operation of the refinery.




	 




	PDVSA Petróleo, pursuant to its contractual rights
	under the crude oil supply agreement with LYONDELL-CITGO, declared a force
	majeure situation in April 1998, and again in February 1999 through October 2000,
	as well as from February 2001 to March 2003.  PDVSA, pursuant to its contractual rights
	under the supplemental supply agreement with LYONDELL-CITGO, which guarantees
	PDVSA Petróleos obligations under the crude oil supply agreement, invoked its
	right to declare a force majeure situation during the same time periods.  As a result of these declarations PDVSA
	Petróleo and PDVSA were relieved of their obligations to deliver crude oil
	under both agreements and LYONDELL-CITGO purchased crude oil from alternate
	sources.  LYONDELL-CITGO received notice
	of force majeure from PDVSA Petróleo and/or PDVSA in December 2002.  LYONDELL-CITGO purchased crude oil in the
	spot market to replace the volume not delivered under contract.  The force majeure was lifted on March 6,
	2003.  In February 2002,
	LYONDELL-CITGO commenced an action against PDVSA and PDVSA Petróleo, in the
	United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking
	damages for

	alleged breaches of the long-term crude oil supply agreement between
	LYONDELL-CITGO and Lagoven (subsequently merged into PDVSA Petróleo) and the
	supplemental supply agreement, between LYONDELL-CITGO and PDVSA.  Both agreements are dated May 5, 1993
	and expire in 2017.  On May 31,
	2002, PDVSA and PDVSA Petróleo filed a motion to dismiss the case.  On August 6, 2003, the judge dismissed
	one of the ten counts in the complaint, allowing the remaining counts to
	proceed through early stages of litigation. 
	The parties engaged in extensive discovery beginning in November 2003.  In the course of expert discovery, on September 30,
	2004, one of LYONDELL-CITGOs retained experts filed a report listing the
	amount of liquidated damages owed by PDVSA and PDVSA Petróleo to LYONDELL-CITGO
	through September 2004 as $125,117,465. 
	For the same period, LYONDELL-CITGOs expert calculated the amount of
	actual damages as $258,447,787 to $259,743,967, depending on the method used to
	calculate interest.  LYONDELL-CITGO also
	claims additional unspecified amounts for attorneys fees and costs.  Discovery was formally concluded on October 1,
	2004.  On October 1 and October 6,
	2004, the magistrate judge issued orders directing PDVSA and PDVSA Petróleo to
	produce all Board of Directors minutes and related documents to
	LYONDELL-CITGO.  PDVSA informed the
	magistrate judge that it could not comply with his order because granting
	LYONDELL-CITGO unrestricted access to PDVSAs Board of Directors materials
	violated Venezuelan law.  The magistrate
	judge entered an adverse inference sanction against PDVSA and PDVSA Petróleo,
	ordering that the court may infer that the Board of Directors documents were
	unfavorable to PDVSA and favorable to LYONDELL-CITGO.  The magistrate judge also ordered that the
	court may give the strongest weight to the evidence already in the case in
	favor of LYONDELL-CITGO, but may also consider any evidence presented by PDVSA
	to explain why it did not produce the Board of Directors materials.  The judge affirmed the magistrate judges
	adverse inference instruction on April 29, 2005.  Meanwhile, on October 22, 2004, both
	parties filed motions for summary judgment with the court, which have been
	fully briefed.  These motions are still
	pending.  Management of the companies
	intends to contest vigorously LYONDELL-CITGOs claims.  See Item 8.A.7 Legal Proceedings.




	 




	Through Chalmette Refining, an equal-share joint
	venture between PDVSA and ExxonMobil, we have a net interest in refining
	capacity of 92 MBPD in a refinery located in Chalmette, Louisiana.  The Chalmette refinery processes upgraded
	extra-heavy crude oil to be produced by our Cerro Negro joint venture.  PDVSA (through PDV Chalmette) has an option
	to purchase up to 50% of the refined products produced at the Chalmette
	refinery. PDVSA did not exercise or assign this option to CITGO for 2001 or
	2002 or 2003.  ExxonMobil, which operates
	both the Cerro Negro joint venture and the Chalmette refinery, purchased substantially
	all of the refined products produced by the Chalmette refinery at market prices
	during 2002 and 2003.  See Item 4.B
	Business overviewInitiatives Involving Private Sector ParticipationOrinoco
	Belt Extra-Heavy Crude Oil Projects.




	 




	PDV Holding and ConocoPhillips own an integrated 58
	MBPD coker and 110 MBPD vacuum crude distillation unit within an existing
	refinery owned by ConocoPhillips in Sweeny, Texas.  Each party owns a 50% equity interest in this
	facility.  ConocoPhillips has entered
	into a long-term crude oil supply agreement with us to supply the Sweeny
	refinery with heavy sour crude oil. 
	Revenues from the Sweeny joint venture will consist of fees paid by
	ConocoPhillips to the joint venture under the processing agreement and any
	revenues from the sale of coke to third parties.  Effective December 6, 2002, PDVSA
	declared force majeure under the Crude Oil Supply Agreement and stopped
	shipment of heavy sour crude oil to the Conoco Sweeny refinery.  During the period of force majeure,
	ConocoPhillips obtained heavy, sour crude oil from alternative sources.  PDVSA lifted the force majeure on March 6,
	2003, at which time ConocoPhillips resumed receipt of minimal crude
	volumes.  By July 2003, the crude
	supply deliveries were back to normal.




	 




	We own a 50% interest in the Hovensa refinery in the
	U.S. Virgin Islands, previously owned by Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation,
	with a current refining capacity of approximately 495 MBPD.  The joint venture has entered into long-term
	supply contracts with PDVSA for up to 60% of its crude oil requirements.  During 2002, Hovensa completed construction
	of a delayed coker unit and related facilities that it had been building in
	connection with the formation of the joint venture.




	 





	Europe




	 



	Through Ruhr, a joint venture owned 50% by PDVSA and
	BP RP, we have equity interests in four German refineries (Gelsenkirchen,
	Neustadt, Karlsruhe and Schwedt) in which our net interest in crude oil
	refining capacity at December 31, 2003 was 115 MBPD, 33 MBPD, 37 MBPD and
	45 MBPD, respectively.  Ruhr also owns
	two petrochemical complexes (Gelsenkirchen and Münchmünster).  The Gelsenkirchen complex, which includes




	 




	33














	 




	modern, large-scale units that are integrated with the crude oil
	refineries located in the same complex, primarily produces olefins, aromatic
	products, ammonia and methanol.  The
	Münchmünster complex, integrated with the nearby Bayernoil refinery, primarily
	produces olefins.  Ruhrs petrochemical
	complexes have an average production capacity of approximately 3.8 million
	metric tons per year of olefins, aromatic products, methanol, ammonia and
	various other petrochemical products.




	 




	Through Nynäs, a joint venture owned 50.001% by PDV
	Europa and 49.999% by Neste Oil, we own interests in three specialized
	refineries:  Nynäshamn and Gothenburg in
	Sweden and Dundee in Scotland.  Our net
	interest in crude oil refining capacity in each of these refineries at December 31,
	2003 was 15 MBPD, 5 MBPD and 4 MBPD, respectively.  The Nynäs refineries are specially designed
	to process heavy sour crude oil.  Nynäs
	also owns a 25% interest in a refinery in Eastham, England.  The Eastham refinery is a specialized asphalt
	refinery in which our net interest crude oil refining capacity at December 31,
	2003 was 5MBPD.




	 




	The Nynäs refineries in Nynäshamn produce asphalt and
	naphthenic specialty oils.  The Dundee,
	Gothenberg and Eastham refineries are specialized asphalt refineries.  Nynäs purchases crude oil from us and
	produces asphalt and naphthenic specialty oils, two products for which
	Venezuelan heavy sour crude oil is particularly well suited feedstock due to
	its proportions of naphthenic, paraffinic and aromatic compounds.  Asphalt products are used for road
	construction and various industrial purposes, while naphthenic specialty oils
	are used principally in electrical transformers, as mechanical process oils and
	in the rubber and printing ink industries.




	 




	The following table sets forth our aggregate refinery
	capacity, input supplied by us (out of our own production or bought in the open

	oil requirements to our Venezuelan refineries (approximately 857 MBPD), 177
	MBPD of crude oil to our leased refinery in Curaçao and an aggregate of 1,355
	MBPD of crude oil to refineries owned by our international subsidiaries or in
	which we otherwise have an interest.  Of
	the total volumes supplied by us to our international affiliates, 210 MBPD were
	purchased by PDVSA in the global market and supplied to our European
	affiliates.  Additionally, CITGO
	purchased a total of 336 MBPD of crude oil from PDVSA for processing in their refineries.




	 






	Marketing





	 



	In 2003, we exported 1,648 MBPD of crude oil or 67% of
	our total crude oil production and 502 MBPD of refined petroleum products
	produced in Venezuela.  Of total exports
	of crude oil and refined petroleum products, 1,183 MBPD (55%) were sold to the
	United States and Canada.  During the
	period from January through December 2003, according to the Petroleum
	Supply Monthly dated April 2004, we were the fourth largest aggregate
	supplier of crude oil and refined petroleum products in the United States.




	 




	Of our total crude oil exports in 2003, an aggregate
	of 923 MBPD (56%) were exported to the United States and Canada; 572 MBPD (35%)
	to the Caribbean and Central America; 88 MBPD (5%) to Europe and 65 MBPD (4%)
	to South America and other destinations.




	 




	Of our total refined petroleum products produced in
	Venezuela in 2003, approximately 432 MBPD were used in the domestic market and
	502 MBPD were exported.  Of the total
	exports of refined petroleum products in 2003, 260 MBPD (52%) were sold to the
	United States and Canada; 103 MBPD (20%) to the Caribbean and Central America
	and 139 MBPD (28%) to South America and other destinations.

	affiliates have entered into long-term supply contracts with us that require us
	to supply minimum quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks to such
	affiliates, usually for 20 to 25 years. 
	These contracts are scheduled to expire in or after 2006.



	 




	Such contracts incorporate price formulas based on the
	market value of a slate of refined petroleum products deemed to be produced
	from each particular grade of crude oil or feedstock, less certain deemed
	refining costs, certain actual costs, including transportation charges, import
	duties and taxes, and a deemed margin, which varies according to the grade of
	crude oil or other feedstock delivered. 
	Deemed margins and deemed costs are adjusted periodically by a formula
	primarily based on the rate of inflation. 
	Because deemed operating costs and the slate of refined petroleum
	products deemed to be produced for a given barrel of crude oil or other
	feedstock do not necessarily reflect the actual costs and yields in any period,
	the actual refining margin earned by the purchaser under the various contracts
	will vary depending on, among other things, the efficiency with which such
	purchaser conducts its operations during such period.  These contracts are designed to reduce the
	inherent earnings volatility of the refining and marketing operations of our
	international refining affiliates.  Other
	supply contracts between us and our U.S. affiliates provide for the sale of
	crude oil at market prices.




	 




	Some of the above contracts provide that, under
	certain circumstances, if supplies are interrupted, we are required to
	compensate the affected affiliate for any additional costs incurred in securing
	crude oil or other feedstocks.  These
	crude oil supply contracts may be terminated by mutual agreement, by either
	party in the event of




	 




	37














	 




	a material default, bankruptcy or similar financial hardship on the
	part of the other party or, in certain cases, if we no longer hold, directly or
	indirectly, 50% or more of the ownership interests in the related affiliate.




	 





	Sales of Crude Oil to Third Parties


	.  Most of our export sales of crude oil to
	third parties, including customers in the United States with which we maintain
	long-standing commercial relationships, are made at market prices pursuant to
	our general terms and conditions, and priced in dollars.  Among our customers are major oil companies
	and other medium-sized companies. 
	Although our general terms and conditions do not require specified
	volumes to be bought or sold, historically, a majority of our customers have
	taken shipments on a regular basis at a relatively constant volume throughout
	the year.



	 





	Sales of Refined Products


	.  We conduct all our retail sales in the United
	States through CITGO.  CITGOs major
	products are light fuels (including gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel),
	industrial products and petrochemicals, asphalt, and lubricants and waxes.  Gasoline sales accounted for 57% of CITGOs
	total sales in 2003.  CITGO markets
	CITGO-branded gasoline through approximately 14,000 independently owned and
	operated retail outlets, located throughout the United States, primarily east
	of the Rocky Mountains.



	 




	CITGO also markets jet fuel directly to airline
	customers at over 25 airports, diesel fuel in wholesale rack sales to
	distributors and in bulk through contract sales (primarily as heating oil in
	the Northeast region of the United States) or on a spot basis, petrochemicals
	in bulk to a variety of U.S. manufacturers as raw materials for finished goods,
	including sulfur, cycle oils, liquid petroleum gas, petroleum coke and residual
	fuel oil, asphalt to independent contractors for use in the construction and
	resurfacing of roadways, and many different types, grades and container sizes
	of lubricant and wax products.




	 





	Crude Oil and Refined Product Purchases


	.  CITGO owns no crude oil reserves or
	production facilities and must therefore rely on purchases of crude oil and
	feedstocks for its refinery operations. 
	We are CITGOs largest supplier of crude oil, and CITGO has entered into
	long-term crude oil supply agreements with us with respect to the crude oil
	requirements for each of CITGOs refineries. 
	CITGO also purchases crude oil in the market.  In addition, because CITGOs refinery
	operations do not produce sufficient refined petroleum products to meet the
	demands of its branded distributors, CITGO purchases refined petroleum
	products, primarily gasoline, from third party refiners.  CITGO also purchases refined petroleum
	products from various other affiliates, including LYONDELL-CITGO, Chalmette
	Refining and Hovensa, pursuant to long-term contracts.  In 2003, CITGO purchased 371 MBPD of refined
	petroleum products under these contracts. 
	In addition, CITGO occasionally purchases on a spot basis refined
	petroleum products from our Venezuelan refineries.



	 





	Marketing in Europe




	 



	We supply crude oil to our European affiliates pursuant
	to various supply agreements.  The crude
	oil that we supply to our European affiliates exceeds, as a percentage of total
	supply, our aggregate net ownership interest in such entities combined
	refining capacity.  In 2003, we supplied
	to the European refineries in which we held an interest, 268 MBPD of crude oil,
	of which 58 MBPD were exported from Venezuela and 210 MBPD were purchased in
	world markets.




	 




	The crude oil processed at the Ruhr Oel refineries is
	supplied 50% by us and 50% by Deutsche BP pursuant to a joint venture agreement
	and a long-term supply contract. 
	Pursuant to these agreements, Ruhr does not acquire title to any crude
	oil or refined petroleum products.  Instead,
	the crude oil supplied by us or Deutsche BP remains owned by us or Deutsche BP,
	as applicable, throughout the refining process. 
	Our share of the refined petroleum products processed at the Ruhr Oel
	refineries is distributed through Deutsche BPs marketing network.  The operating costs of the Ruhr Oel
	refineries are shared equally by us and Deutsche BP.




	 




	We receive 50% of the revenues from Deutsche BPs
	sales of the refined petroleum products processed at the Ruhr Oel refineries,
	less attributable operating and marketing costs.  This arrangement effectively provides Ruhr
	Oel with constant break-even results.  We
	supply crude oil to the Ruhr Oel refineries and receive revenues from the sale
	of refined petroleum products attributable to such crude oil.

	Nynäs purchases crude oil from PDVSA and produces
	asphalt and naphthenic specialty oils, two products for which Venezuelan heavy
	sour crude oil is a particularly well suited feedstock due to its content of
	naphthenic, paraffinic and aromatic compounds. 
	Asphalt products are used for road construction and various industrial
	purposes, while naphthenic specialty oils are used principally in electrical
	transformers, as mechanical process oils and in the rubber and printing ink
	industries.  Nynäs does not own crude oil
	reserves or production facilities and, therefore, must purchase crude oil for
	its refining operations.  Nearly all
	crude oil purchased by Nynäs is supplied by us pursuant to long-term supply
	contracts.  We supply Nynäs only with
	high sulfur, extra-heavy Venezuelan crude oil.




	 




	Nynäs markets asphalt products through an extensive
	marketing network in several European countries.  Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and
	Continental Europe are the source of 19%, 29% and 14%, respectively, of Nynäs
	consolidated revenues for 2003.  Nynäs
	markets its naphthenic specialty oils throughout Europe, Africa, the Middle
	East and Australia, and the distillates that it produces are either sold as
	fuel or further processed into naphthenic specialty oils.  Nynäs distributes its refined products primarily
	by a terminal network, specialized bitumen ships, rail tanks and trucks.




	 





	Marketing in Latin America and Caribbean




	 



	PDVSA has been strengthening a commercial strategy of
	integration that will allow the completion of several projects in the countries
	of the region, within the scope of the PetroAmerica initiative which is being
	promoted by Venezuela, based on the establishment of cooperation and
	integration mechanisms and the utilization of the resources and potentials of
	Latin America and the Caribbean, in order to support the socio- economic
	improvement of its population.




	 




	The implementation of this initiative is based on
	bilateral negotiations, with the intention of transferring financial resources
	to the people through the joint action of the states.  It is also based on cost rationalization
	through tax and port services cost reductions and on cooperation agreements,
	not only for energy issues, but for education, health and infrastructure, as
	well.




	 




	During 2004, PDVSA supplied under special terms, crude
	oil and refined products to the Caribbean and Central America by means of the
	San José and Caracas Agreements. 
	Furthermore, in 2005 we created PDVSA-Cuba in order to promote refining
	and marketing businesses in the area.  In
	the South American market, PDVSA has been making efforts towards the
	strengthening of the commercial relationships with Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay,
	Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia, through the endorsement of memoranda of
	understanding with their national oil enterprises, with the intention of
	studying crude oil and refined products supply opportunities.

	Since December 1993, the Venezuelan government
	has permitted private sector participants to market lubricants in Venezuela.




	 




	Through our subsidiary Deltaven, we market and
	distribute retail gasoline and other refined petroleum products under the PDV
	brand in the Venezuelan local market. 
	Deltaven is also promoting the development of the commercial
	infrastructure and services for retail clients with the participation of the
	private sector.




	 




	The retail price for gasoline is set by the Venezuelan
	government and represents approximately 13% of the export price for gasoline in
	2003.




	 




	Since the end of 2001, three private domestic
	participants, Grupo Trebol, Llanopetrol and CCMonagas, and four private
	international participants, Shell, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil and British
	Petroleum, have been marketing their products in Venezuela.  These companies market their brands through
	830 retail outlets owned or operated by them, and have a market share in the
	gasoline and diesel sector of 53% compared to Deltavens 47%.




	 





	Gas





	 




	Venezuela has abundant natural gas fields.  According to BP AMOCO Statistical Review of
	World Energy 2005, at November 2004 Venezuela was the ninth largest owner
	of proved reserves in the world and the largest owner of proved reserves in
	Latin America.  These reserves were
	estimated at 226,000 BCF at the end of 2003, of which 150,043 BCF are proved
	reserves.  91% of these are associated
	with crude oil deposits and 9% are in the form of free gas.  Our total sales of methane gas in the
	Venezuelan market amounted to 2,068 MMCFD by December 2003.




	 





	Petrochemicals





	 




	The Venezuelan government decided in June 2005 to
	transfer the activities, assets and shares held by PDVSA in Pequiven (the
	companys shareholder) to the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and to submit
	this transfer for approval by the Shareholder of PDVSA.  The transfer is subject to the reform of the
	Petrochemical Act and the resolution of other legal and administrative issues.




	 




	Pequiven was established in 1977 to produce and
	commercialize petrochemical products in the domestic and international
	markets.  Pequiven is organized into
	business units focused on three production lines:




	 




	


	     

	olefins and derivative products;



	 




	


	     

	fertilizers; and



	 




	


	     

	industrial products.



	 




	Pequiven is party to 17 joint ventures with domestic
	and international business partners. 
	Most of the production facilities of these joint ventures are located at
	Pequivens complexes.  We estimate that
	the combined production capacity of these complexes is approximately eight
	million tons per year.




	 




	Pequiven operates three petrochemical complexes in
	Venezuela:




	 




	


	     

	the ZuliaEl Tablazo complex, in western
	Venezuela, which produces mainly olefins, chlorine or caustic soda, fertilizers,
	industrial feedstocks and thermoplastic resins;



	 




	


	     

	the Morón Complex, in central Venezuela, which
	produces fertilizers and sulfuric acid; and



	 




	40














	 




	


	     

	the Jose Complex, in eastern Venezuela, which
	produces methanol, fertilizers, industrial products and methyl terbutyl-ether
	(MTBE).



	 




	In addition to the three petrochemical complexes,
	Pequiven also has facilities to produce aromatics in the PDVSA El Palito
	refinery, located in the central north region of Venezuela.  The gross production of Pequivens wholly
	owned plants and complexes in 2003 and 2002 was approximately 2.3 million
	metric tons and 3.7 million metric tons, respectively.  The gross production of Pequivens joint
	ventures in 2003 and 2002 was approximately 3.9 million metric tons and 3.23
	million metric tons, respectively. 
	Products of these joint ventures include methanol, MTBE, polyethylenes,
	polypropylenes, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycols, caustic soda, chlorine,
	fertilizers, caprolactam and other specialty products.




	 




	Pequivens goals are to increase the production of our
	petrochemical products and promote growth in this sector by increasing the
	sales of petrochemical products domestically. 
	It is expected to achieve an annual combined production capacity of 12.0
	million metric tons by 2006 at Pequivens plants and through Pequivens joint
	ventures.  Pequiven also will continue to
	focus on improving competitiveness (especially in the Latin American market)
	and profitability of the natural chemical and petrochemical sector.




	 




	In this regard, Pequiven continuously explores new
	projects and joint ventures with third parties. Currently there are in
	discussions with potential partners regarding the development of the Jose
	Complex.  To date, Pequivens joint
	ventures have allowed it to establish a significant and growing presence in
	regional and international markets.  In
	2003, North America remained Pequivens largest export destination followed by
	South America, Europe and Asia, and Central America and the Caribbean.

	Extra-heavy Crude Oil





	 




	Previously our subsidiary Bitor was developing
	reserves of approximately 429 million of metric tons of extra-heavy crude oil
	(or approximately 2,690 million barrels) principally through a process of
	emulsifying natural extra-heavy crude oil in water to create an alternative
	liquid fuel to generate electricity, which we refer to as Orimulsion®.  However, PDVSA decided to apply most of these
	reserves to the production of commercial crude oil, minimizing the production
	of Orimulsion®.  This new scheme is part
	of an effort to develop a financially balanced strategy for our natural
	extra-heavy crude oil production.




	 




	In December 2001, Bitor, China National Oil and
	Gas Exploration and Development Corporation and Petrochina Fuel Oil Company
	Limited formed a joint venture called Orifuels Sinoven, S.A. with the view to
	building and operating a production facility capable of producing up to 6.5
	million metric tons by 2006.  Orifuels
	Sinoven, S.A. is developing production facilities in two locations in
	Venezuela; Morichal facilities were approximately 30% complete and the Jose
	plant was approximately 80% complete by June 2005.




	 




	41














	 




	Due to this new approach to the extra-heavy crude oil
	business, we have decided to call off all other production facilities
	development plans.  We expect to complete
	the Orifuels Sinoven complex by October 2005 and once it is operational,
	this will be our exclusive Orimulsion® manufacturing facility.  From the production of this complex, Bitor
	will supply directly its Orimulsion® supply agreements.




	 




	Our Orimulsion® production capacity is currently 6.5
	million metric tons per year (or approximately 41 million barrels per
	year).  Our net production in 2003 was
	approximately 5.2 million metric tons (or 35 million barrels), as compared to
	5.4 million metric tons (or 37 million barrels) in 2002.

	Overview of Main Projects 100% Owned by PDVSA





	 






	The Anaco Gas Project






	 




	The objective of the Anaco Gas Project is to satisfy
	the internal demand for gas.  This
	project includes designing and building the facilities anticipated to yield a
	production of 2,400 MMCFD of gas and 35 thousand barrels per day of associated
	light crude oil when completed.  The
	project is being developed in two phases, with start up operations (Phase I)
	capable of producing 2,016 MMCFD of gas, anticipated to commence in 2007.  We expect the production capacity of this
	project to reach 2,400 million MMCFD of gas by 2008 (Phase II).  The total estimated capital investment for
	this project is $732 million.




	 




	In a probable Phase III, project installations will
	reach a production capacity of 2,700 MMCFD of gas, according to PDVSAs
	Opportunities Portfolio 2003-2022.




	 






	The ICO Project






	 




	The objective of this project is to connect Venezuelas
	central and eastern (Anaco-Barquisimeto) and western (Ule-Amuay) natural gas
	transmission systems with a view to:




	 




	


	     

	facilitate the supply of gas to the western
	region of Venezuela;



	 




	


	     

	expand the delivery of gas to other regions and
	cities within the country; and



	 




	


	     

	promote industrial and commercial development in
	the areas along the gas transmission pipeline to be built in connection with
	this project.



	 




	We expect to construct 300 km of gas pipeline of 36-inch &
	30-inch, running from Morón to Río Seco and three compression stations.  This project has two phases; Phase I includes
	construction of 70 km of a 36-inch diameter gas pipeline running from Quero to
	Río Seco and five (5) automatic valve stations; Phase II includes
	construction of 230 km of a 30-inch diameter gas pipeline running from Quero to
	El Manglar and three (3) compression stations located at Altagracia, Los
	Morros and Morón.  The engineering of
	Phase I was completed by the end of the third quarter 2003; the construction of
	this Phase was completed by the end of the first quarter of 2005.  With respect to Phase II, the construction of
	112 km of a 30-inch diameter gas pipeline will be completed by the end of 2005;
	the construction of the compression stations will start in the fourth quarter
	of 2005.  This infrastructure allows a
	gas supply ranging between 450 and 520 MMCFD, with an installed capacity of
	155,000 Horse Power ISO at different levels of discharge pressure between 1,000
	and 1,200 pounds per square inch.




	 




	We expect to invest approximately $413 million in this
	project, anticipating its completion by December 2007.




	 






	The Jose 250 Project






	 




	The main purpose of this project is to provide all the
	required infrastructure for gas conditioning and processing of the associated
	gas produced from the operational Eastern Areas of Anaco (San Joaquín) and
	North of Monagas (Jusepín and Pirital), to satisfy domestic market demand and
	supply injection gas for secondary oil recovery processes of North Monagas oil
	fields.




	 




	We expected to build three new Liquid Extraction
	Plants with a total capacity to process 2,350 MMSCFD, one fractionation unit
	with capacity to fraction 50,000 BPD of LNG, expansion of the marine terminal
	of the Jose Condominium and construction and expansion of LNG pipelines.  Phase I of the project will be completed in
	2007 and Phase II in 2008.  We will have
	an additional production of 32 MBPD of LNG in 2007, reaching a total of 75 MBPD
	of LNG in year 2008.  In 2005 the
	engineering studies continue to progress. 
	The estimated total investment for the project is $664 million.

	The Western Cryogenic Project






	 




	The development of the Western Cryogenic Complex (WCC)
	is one of the main projects included in the 2005 - 2010 Business Plan of
	PDVSA-Western Division.  Its objective is
	to optimize the natural gas scheme processing in the Western region of
	Venezuela by increasing the ethane and LNG production.  This project is expected to reduce
	significantly the operation and maintenance costs of current plants, allowing a
	better expansion of the gas business in the area.




	 




	The proposed scheme will yield a production of 35 MBPD
	of Ethane for Pequiven  El Tablazo and 70 MBPD of LNG, decreasing
	substantially the countrys western processing cost and promoting the LNG
	business growth.




	 




	The estimated capital investment for the project is
	$600 million.  Main facilities include
	two extraction trains, each with a capacity of 475 MMSCFD of gas, one gas
	fractionating train with installed capacity of 35 MBPD and offsite facilities.




	 






	The Integral Ceuta-Tomoporo Project






	 




	The main purpose of the Integral Ceuta - Tomoporo
	project is to maximize the recoverable crude oil reserves value of Ceuta  Tomoporo,
	through exploiting the B-superior Eocene formation, which has estimated
	reserves of 1,000 million barrels of 23.6° API crude oil.  The reservoir was discovered in 1988.




	 




	This project also has an impact on the sustainable
	economic development of its area of influence. 
	Our 2005-2010 business plan activities include drilling 6 vertical and
	47 inclined producing wells, together with 21 injector wells.  In 2004 we drilled 3 vertical and 7 inclined
	wells.  In 2005 we will construct one
	flow station, 21 Km of crude oil and gas pipelines, roads and a cluster
	platform.  Total investment costs
	throughout project life (2004-2021) will be approximately $1,200 million, with
	an average crude oil production of 90 to 277 MBPD.  Net present value expected from this project
	totals $3,257 million.  By December 2003,
	total investments totaled $28 million.




	 





	Transportation and Infrastructure




	 





	Pipelines and Storage





	 




	Venezuela and the Caribbean


	.  We have an extensive transportation network
	in Venezuela consisting of approximately 3,113 km in total of crude oil
	pipelines (over 28 pipelines), with a throughput capacity of approximately
	6,340 MBPD of crude oil.  These pipelines
	connect production areas to terminal facilities and refineries.  We have a network of gas pipelines in
	Venezuela totaling approximately 3,781 km, with a throughput capacity of 2,748
	MM3D.  Our network is comprised of the
	Western and East Central systems, stretching from Lake Maracaibo, in the Zulia
	state to Punto Fijo, in the Falcón state and from Puerto Ordaz, in the Bolívar
	state to Barquisimeto, in the Lara state. 
	We also have a network of 1,179 km of products pipelines with a total
	flow capacity of approximately 831 MBPD.



	 




	We maintain total crude oil and refined products
	storage capacity of approximately 30 MMB and 74 MMB in Venezuela, respectively,
	including tank farms, refineries and shipping terminals, of which approximately
	16.3 MMB is available at our refineries. 
	Our terminal facilities are comprised of nine maritime ports as well as
	two river ports.  A new terminal facility
	was completed at the Jose Complex in 2003.




	 




	In addition to the storage and terminal facilities in
	Venezuela, we maintain storage and terminal facilities in the Caribbean,
	located in Bonaire, the Bahamas, Trinidad, Curaçao and St. Eustatius, with an
	aggregate storage capacity of 50 MMB as of December 31, 2003.  The Curaçao oil terminal, which is leased
	from the Netherlands Antilles government, had a storage capacity of
	approximately 15 MMB at December 31, 2003.




	 





	United States


	.  CITGO owns and operates a crude oil pipeline
	and three products pipeline systems. 
	CITGO also has equity interests in three crude oil pipeline companies
	and six refined product pipeline companies. 
	CITGOs pipeline interests provide it with access to substantial
	refinery feedstocks and reliable transportation to the refined



	 




	44














	 




	product markets, as well as cash flows from dividends.  One of the refined product pipelines in which
	CITGO has an interest, Colonial Pipeline, is the largest refined product
	pipeline in the United States, transporting refined products form the Gulf
	Coast to mid-Atlantic and Eastern seaboard states.




	 





	Europe


	.  Through equity interests in five European
	pipeline companies, we have interests in four crude oil terminals and four
	crude oil pipelines in northwestern Europe, including two pipelines from the
	Mediterranean coast to Germany.  We also
	own three port facilities in the Rhine-Herne Canal providing barge access to
	Rhine and North Sea coastal ports.



	 





	Shipping




	 



	At December 31, 2003, PDV Marina, a wholly owned
	subsidiary of PDVSA, owned and operated 21 tankers with a total capacity of
	approximately 1,347 MDWT and an average age at December 31, 2003 of
	approximately 14 years.




	 




	During 2003, average shipments of crude oil and
	refined petroleum products amounted to approximately 1,111 MBPD, of which 436
	MBPD were shipped by our own tankers and the remainder by chartered tankers.




	 




	PDVSA achieved the certification of its ships and
	docks to the International Safety Code of Ships and Port Installations, which
	entered in effect on July 1, 2004. 
	Accordingly, we carried out a project which included risk evaluations,
	training, and equipment procurement, among other tasks and have spent about $5
	million to date.  The certifications can
	be seen at http://www2.imo.org/ISPSCode.




	 





	Research and Development




	 



	Intevep is our wholly owned subsidiary responsible for
	research and technology support.  Its
	overall mission is to create and sustain a competitive advantage for PDVSA
	through efficient and effective development, adaptation and application of
	technology.  Intevep contributes
	substantially, through application of technology, toward exploration for new
	oil and gas reserves, better utilization of existing reserves, increasing
	production, reduction in operational costs, greater productivity, upgrading
	processes for heavy and extra-heavy crude oil, improvements in product quality,
	improvements in health and safety standards and the development of new
	petroleum-derived products and innovative processes.




	 




	During 2003, we continued to develop products and
	technologies such as DISOL® (Gas-to-Liquid technology) and new improvements in
	the DISOL catalyst were obtained.  Additionally,
	a pilot plant was designed to be built at Intevep next year.  AQUADIESEL®, a low emission diesel for public
	transportation, was successfully tested in Houston, Texas, US.  Additionally, cost reductions in this
	micro-emulsion formulation were achieved. Further progress was made in the
	development of AQUACONVERSION®, a catalytic process used to produce synthetic
	crude from Morichal heavy oil.  Two
	commercial units of ISAL® technology started up in the USA.  The basic engineering of two DHDV units for reducing
	sulfur in diesel and the visualization study of a HDHPLUS® unit at the Puerto
	La Cruz refinery were completed.




	 





	Environmental and Safety Matters




	 





	Environmental





	 



	The majority of PDVSAs subsidiaries, both in
	Venezuela and abroad, are subject to various environmental laws and regulations
	under which they may be required to make significant investments and
	expenditures to modify their facilities and to prevent or remedy the
	environmental effects of waste disposal and spills of pollutants.  In the United States and Europe, our
	operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws
	and regulations, which may require them to take action to remedy or minimize
	the effects on the environment from our operations of earlier plant decommissioning
	or leakage of pollutants.




	 




	PDVSA is taking important steps to prevent risks to
	the environment, peoples health, and the integrity of its installations.  In 2003, PDVSA continued implementing its
	Integral Risk Management System (SIR-PDVSA®)




	 




	45














	 




	throughout the company and full deployment of this System is expected
	to be completed by 2006.  This management
	system is based on international practices and standards, such as ISO 14001 for
	Environmental Management; ISO 18000 and British Standard BS 8800 for health and
	Occupational Safety, and OSHAs and American Petroleum Institute (API)s 750
	for process safety.  PDVSA has already
	invested $16 million and is expected to invest an additional $30 million to complete
	full implementation of its Risk Management System.  In addition, PDVSA has an investment plan to
	comply with the applicable environmental regulations in Venezuela.  This investment plan contemplates
	approximately $2,255 million in capital expenditures from 2004 through 2009,
	including the following:  $1,150 million
	for product quality; $911 million for risk control at operating sites; $162
	million for environmental compliance projects; and $32 million for other
	environmental-related investments.  Also,
	there is a plan to remediate a total of 13,973 oil pits to temporality store
	oil sludge and/or drilling cuts.  The
	plan has an expected duration of 12 years and started in 2001.  As of December 2003, a total of 3,417
	petroleum pits have been remediated.  The
	overall plan is to recover and to recycle the disposed waste, including
	abandoned installations, and to transform those areas into useful assets.  PDVSA will spend approximately $408 million
	to complete the project from 2004-2012. 
	(See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item
	18. Financial Statements).




	 




	CITGO estimates expenditures of approximately $785
	million for environmental and regulatory capital projects from 2004 through
	2008.  During 2003, PDVSA spent
	approximately $59 million in Venezuela and CITGO spent approximately $253
	million for environmental and regulatory capital improvements in its
	operations.




	 




	The oil industry sabotage and operational stoppage in
	December 2002 and the first months of 2003 caused effects on the
	environment which, although difficult to quantify and to evaluate, did impact
	negatively the surroundings of our wells, plants and other facilities, with an
	economic impact due to damage remediation actions.  (See note 21 to our consolidated financial
	statements, included in Item 18. 
	Financial Statements).




	 




	During 2003, the Water Treatment Plant at El Tablazo
	Complex, Maracaibo, Zulia state became operational.  This water is to be used as industrial water
	for El Tablazo, avoiding the discharge of 1,300 lts/sec of sewage water to the
	Maracaibo Lake.  Those amounts represent
	13% of the total sewed water discharged from the City of Maracaibo,
	contributing to the remediation of the Maracaibo Lake.




	 




	CITGO has received various notices of violation from
	the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory agencies, which
	include notices under the federal Clean Air Act, and could be designated as
	Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) jointly with other industrial
	companies with respect to sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
	Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). 
	These notices are being reviewed and, in some cases, remedial actions
	are being undertaken, and in others, CITGO is engaged in settlement
	negotiations.




	 




	Conditions that require additional expenditures may
	exist at various sites including, but not limited to, our operating complexes,
	closed refineries, service stations and crude oil and petroleum storage
	terminals.  Based on currently available
	information we cannot determine the amounts of any such expenditure.  Management believes that these matters, in
	the normal course of operations, will not have a material effect on the
	financial position, liquidity or operations of PDVSA.




	 






	Safety





	 



	Due to the nature of our business, our operating
	subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject to stringent occupational health
	and safety laws in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  As such, each of our subsidiaries and joint
	ventures maintains comprehensive safety, training and maintenance programs with
	the help of international and recognized leading authorities in this area.  Our management believes that our activities
	are conducted substantially in compliance with all applicable laws.




	 





	4.C



	         

	Organizational structure




	 





	PDVSA was formed by the Venezuelan government in 1975,
	and conducts its operations through its Venezuelan and international
	subsidiaries.




	 




	46














	 




	Through December 31, 1997, we conducted our
	operations in Venezuela through three main operating subsidiaries, Corpoven,
	S.A., Lagoven, S.A. and Maraven, S.A.  In
	1997, we established a new operating structure based on business units.  Since then, we have been involved in a
	process of transforming our operations with the aim of improving our
	productivity, modernizing our administrative processes and enhancing the return
	on capital.  The transformation process
	involved the merger of Lagoven, S.A. and Maraven, S.A. into Corpoven S.A.,
	effective January 1, 1998, and renaming the combined entity
	PDVSA-P&G.  In May 2001, we
	renamed PDVSA-P&G PDVSA Petróleo and by the end of 2002, certain of our
	nonassociated gas assets were transferred to PDVSA Gas.




	 




	Additionally, we have also made several adjustments
	within our organization in order to enhance internal control of our operations,
	to improve on our governance model and to align our operating structure with
	the long-term strategies of our shareholder. 
	These adjustments consist primarily of the adoption of a new framework
	of operating structure that increases the involvement of our board of directors
	in our activities, and, at the same time, enhances PDVSAs operational
	independence.




	 




	Below is a summary of the significant changes that
	have ocurred within our main subsidiaries and affiliates:




	 







	PDVSA Petróleo




	:
	This is the core business of PDVSA.  Its
	operations have not suffered changes and only its administrative structure has
	been adjusted.  The most significant
	changes for this affiliate is the restructuring of the corporate units of
	Exploration, Production, Refining, and Marketing and Supply.



	 







	Carbozulia




	:
	In February 2004 net assets of this company amounting to $91 milllion were
	transferred to Corpozulia Corporación de Desarrollo de la Región Zuliana, a
	fund promoting regional development.  PDVSA
	still holds some guarantees related to two joint venture agreements (Carbones
	del Guasare and Carbones de la Guajira) previously established by Carbozulia.



	 







	Palmaven




	:
	This affiliate was completely transformed. 
	Its new role is to promote the national social development through
	educational, health and job creating initiatives, directed to the poorest
	sectors of the Venezuelan society.  Its
	previous activities related to environmental services were transferred to the
	HSE (health, safety and environment) organizations of other operating
	affiliates and the participation of Palmaven in 14 agricultural joint ventures
	are being evaluated in order to be sold or transferred.



	 







	Bitor




	:
	Its Board of Directors has been instructed to minimize the production of
	Orimulsion®, to complete the production facilities of its joint venture
	Orifuels Sinoven, to comply with its supply agreements and to close its
	international marketing joint ventures. 
	Its personnel are being transferred to PDVSA Petróleo.  PDVSA from now on will apply most of these
	reserves to the production of extra-heavy crude oil.



	 







	Cied




	:
	This non-profit association used to provide training services to the different
	affiliates of PDVSA.  Currently, this
	function has been decentralized and affiliates are free to contract their
	training services.  Its personnel were
	redistributed to other organizations within PDVSA.



	 







	PDVSA Trading




	:
	This affiliate was created to manage commodity price risk associated with crude
	and refined products businesses.  It has
	been deactivated due to a redefinition of PDVSAs refining and marketing
	strategy.  Some administrative steps are
	being taken prior to its definitive closure.



	 







	PDVSA Gas




	:
	Since August 2003 the gas production activities and the strategic projects
	Plataforma Deltana, Mariscal Sucre and Cigma have been delegated to the PDVSAs
	Exploration and Production division, whereas the LNG activities have been
	delegated to PDVSAs Refining division. 
	Some administrative and operating activities and personnel of PDVSA Gas
	are being moved to the eastern region of the country.



	 







	CVP




	:
	This affiliate continues managing all matters related to mixed enterprises such
	as The Orinoco Belt Joint Ventures, Risk Sharing Agreements, Operating
	Agreements and P&GI Investments. 
	Additionally, it has a new responsibility regarding the administration
	of FONDESPA, a trust created to finance social projects, which will be funded
	by extraordinary revenues coming from higher oil prices.



	 




	47














	 







	Interven




	:
	This affiliate was reorganized in order to manage all business derived from the
	Cooperation Agreement signed between Argentina and Venezuela.  PDVSA began working with the Argentinean
	energy company Enarsa, to evaluate upstream and downstream business
	opportunities in Argentina. 
	Additionally, the Board of Directors of PDVSA in its April 7, 2005
	meeting decided to transfer the businesses of Citgo Latinoamerica (CILA) to
	Interven in order to support a strategy of regional integration.  The day-to-day activities of CILA are being
	performed by the international sales management of our corporate supply and
	marketing division.



	 







	Pequiven




	:
	According to a Presidential Decree published on June 2005, Pequiven will
	be transferred to the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum.  The completion of this transfer will depend
	on the reform of the Ley De Estimulo Al Dearrollo De Las Actividades
	Petroquimica, Carboquimica y Similares, or the Petrochemical Law, and other
	legal and administrative issues.



	 







	Isla Refinery




	:
	PDVSA has initiated studies to determine the profitability of this business,
	investments required to improve the process capacity and to meet regulatory and
	product quality demands.  These studies
	are being utilitzed to align the performance of Isla Refinery with national
	strategic guidelines and PDVSAs business plan and to streamline its business
	processes.



	 







	Deltaven




	:
	This affiliate distributes refined products within the domestic market.  It maintains its own distribution network and
	has positioned itself well with wholesalers and retailers.  Its strategy includes gaining better position
	within the distribution chain through improvements of its service stations and
	truck float.



	 







	International subsidiaries




	:
	We are currently reviewing our international assets strategic and financial
	performance.  In this sense, we are
	evaluating the net contribution to PDVSA of our affiliates CITGO, Ruhr Oel,
	Nynas, BORCO, BOPEC, Isla Refinery, in order to optimize the return of our
	international portfolio.  This evaluation
	of our international subsidiaries might lead to restructurings, merges,
	divestures or acquisitions in the near future.



	 




	For the time being, PDVSAs board of Directors is not
	considering any further changes of its organizational structure.




	 




	Our most important subsidiaries and affiliates at December 31,
	2003 and our percentage of equity capital (to the nearest whole number) are set
	out below.  The principal country of

	Effects,
	Losses and Damages resulting from the Work Stoppage and Other Events in
	the Petroleum Sector





	 




	During December 2002
	and the first months of 2003, a series of national events significantly
	interrupted the economic activities in Venezuela.  Concurrently, a substantial group of workers
	from PDVSA and its Venezuelan subsidiaries abruptly initiated a work stoppage that
	interrupted the Companys normal, ongoing operations in Venezuela, which
	continued despite requests made by management of the Company in the local media
	for them to return to their positions. 
	PDVSA is of the opinion that this interruption of the activities, and
	related actions, constituted sabotage, and accordingly the Company has referred
	the matter to the competent authorities, including the General Prosecutor of
	the Republic, to establish responsibility for the damage resulting from these
	actions.




	 




	As stated,
	these events resulted in losses and damages, as well as a reduction in the
	countrys economic activities.  The
	economic performance of PDVSA significantly affects some of the economic
	variables of the country, among others the gross domestic product (GDP), the
	generation of foreign exchange and the collection of taxes and other
	contributions (approximately 18%; 67% and 57%, approximately, of the national
	totals for the year ended December 31, 2003). Studies performed by the
	Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) indicate that the
