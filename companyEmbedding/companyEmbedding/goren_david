Background






David Goren is a Principal in the Silicon Valley office of Fish & Richardson P.C. His practice emphasizes client counseling in the areas of patent portfolio development and management, including U.S. and foreign patent prosecution and patent acquisition, and across a wide variety of mechanical, electronic and software technologies.  His practice also emphasizes post-grant proceedings, preparation of non-infringement and invalidity opinions, product clearance, patent licensing, counseling on intellectual property strategies, and due diligence in connection with mergers and acquisitions.
In terms of technological breadth, Mr. Goren’s practice encompasses semiconductors, electronics, mechanical devices, and software, as well as optics, medical devices, and business methods.  For example, he has deep exposure to semiconductor technology ranging from transistor structure, such as 3D NAND, TSV and power transistor design, through semiconductor fabrication methods such as deposition, etching, polishing and thermal processing and associated fabrication equipment.  His practice covers mechanical engineering and materials science, electronics, and electromechanical systems, ranging from simple consumer products to batteries; solar technology, such as solar cells and concentrators; voltage regulators; computer networks and networking devices; system-on-chip technology; nanotechnology, such as carbon fibers; and MEMS devices, such microactuators and microsensors and associated fabrication techniques. In software, his experience includes security techniques, applications and clustering algorithms for big data, Internet of Things, image processing, control algorithms, media delivery, and financial software such as aggregation, pricing algorithms, electronic wallets and fraud detection.
Mr. Goren has handled over a dozen post-grant matters, many of which involved coordination of strategy across multiple foreign jurisdictions, including two inter partes reviews.
Mr. Goren also manages prosecution of pro bono patent applications referred through the Federal Circuit Bar Association (FCBA).
Before attending law school, Mr. Goren worked for two years as a patent agent for Greyhawk Systems Inc., a start-up company with technology in the field of liquid crystal projectors.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
