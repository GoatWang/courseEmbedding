DisclosureThis product is no longer available for new business. If you currently have a balance in this variable annuity contract, you may continue to make additional purchase payments. However, once the entire balance has been withdrawn or transferred out, this variable annuity contract will no longer be available for future purchase payments.
Before investing, carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is contained in the contract prospectus and the underlying portfolio prospectuses. You may call or write your Registered Representative or Symetra for free copies of the prospectuses or visit www.symetra.com for online copies. Please read them carefully before investing.

The performance figures quoted represent past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value may fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Market volatility and interest rate changes, among other factors, can drastically affect a portfolio's return. Thus, when redeemed, units may be worth more or less than what was paid.
An investment in a money market portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the portfolio seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the portfolio.

The standardized chart shows performance only as far back as the date the portfolio became part of the separate account. The performance figures are average annual total returns based on a single purchase payment of $10,000. They include deductions for the investment management fees and other expenses (including 12b-1 fees), the mortality & expense risk charge, the asset-related administration charge, a pro-rata portion of the $40 annual administration maintenance charge based on Focus's average account size in the previous calendar year, and the maximum surrender charge, but do not include deductions for applicable premium taxes. The surrender charge is Purchase Payment based and is the lesser of the amount withdrawn, starting at 7% in the first Purchase Payment year and declines as follows (7%, 7%, 7%, 6%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 0%) until the 8th year when there is no surrender charge for that Purchase Payment. If optional riders were not purchased, total returns would be higher.

The non-standardized performance figures are hypothetical and are based on past performance, after deductions for investment management fees and other expenses (including 12b-1 fees) and the mortality and expense risk charge and asset-related administration charge. The figures do not reflect a deduction for contingent deferred sales charge (or surrender charge) or the annual administration maintenance charge - if those were included, total returns would be lower.

Variable annuities, which are suitable for long term investing, are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal invested. While non-qualified annuities offer the added benefit of tax deferral, in the case of qualified annuities, the tax deferral is provided by the retirement plan itself. The investor should focus on the benefits offered by a Variable Annuity to assess if a Variable Annuity is right for them.

Withdrawals may be subject to federal income tax and a 10% IRS early withdrawal tax penalty may also apply to amounts withdrawn prior to age 59 1/2. Consult your attorney or tax advisor for more information.Guarantees and benefits are subject to the claims-paying ability of Symetra Life Insurance Company.

Total return is the total percentage change in the unit value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, over a stated period of time.

Money market yield is a function of type, quality and maturity of a portfolio's investment portfolio and operating expenses. Money market portfolio yield is the annualization on a 365-day basis of the portfolio's net income over a 7-day period. Effective yield is the yield calculated with dividends reinvested. These yields should not be considered representative of future yields as they are not fixed or guaranteed, and the portfolio is not insured. The 7-day yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the portfolio than the total return quotations.

Average annual total return is the average annual percentage change in the unit value of an investment, assuming the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, over a stated period of time.

A sub-account is a subdivision of the insurance company's separate account, which is available as an investment option through a variable annuity contract. Each sub-account invests exclusively in shares of the corresponding portfolio. Therefore, the sub-account inception date is the first date the portfolio was offered by the insurance company's separate account.

A portfolio is a pooled funding vehicle established by an investment company and made available exclusively to a participating insurance company's separate account. Therefore, non-standardized performance reflects performance since the first date the investment company established the portfolio, regardless of whether or not the portfolio was available as a sub-account option under the insurance company's variable annuity contract.

There are special risks associated with investing in these portfolios. Examples may include small company, geographic, international, emerging markets, interest rate, defaulted debt and sector focus. See your prospectus before investing.

The fund of funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds, including the volatility of the financial markets in the U.S. and abroad, as well as the additional risks associated with investing in high yield, small-cap, and foreign securities.

The portfolio expense ratios may incorporate waivers or expense reimbursements currently in effect and are subject to change annually based on each portfolio's contractual arrangements. See individual portfolio prospectus for complete details.

Securities are offered through Symetra Securities, Inc. (SSI). Variable annuities are issued by Symetra Life Insurance Company (SLIC) and are not available in all U.S. states or any U.S. territory. SSI and SLIC are affiliates and are both located at 777 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1200, Bellevue, WA 98004-5135.

Symetra Focus Variable Annuity is an individual flexible premium deferred variable annuity. Contract numbers in most states are RSC-0007 7/06, RSC-0008 10/07 (457), and RSC-0007 LR 5/08. Contract form numbers in Oregon are RSC-0007/OR 7/06 and RSC-0008/OR 10/07.
