Fitch Rates World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B (WOART 
      2015-B):
    

      --$216,000,000 Class A-1 Notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$280,000,000 Class A-2a Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$133,000,000 Class A-2b Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$234,000,000 Class A-3 Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 Class A-4 Notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,160,000 Class B Notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Pool Quality: 2015-B has relatively stable credit quality 
      with a weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. N.A (FICO) score of 724, 
      within range of recent 2014 - 2015 pools, although marginally lower. New 
      vehicles total 97%, and the pool is geographically concentrated in the 
      Southeast, consistent with historical World Omni originations.
    

      High Percentage of Extended-Term Loans: Loans with original terms 
      greater than 60 months total 76.50% in 2015-B. Extended-term loans have 
      historically produced higher loss rates. Mitigating this somewhat is 
      that the borrowers within this longer term range have strong obligor 
      FICO scores. Fitch accounted for this risk in its determination of the 
      loss proxy.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) in 2015-B 
      is consistent with prior transactions. The structure is able to support 
      multiples of Fitch's base case loss proxy of 2.10% that are commensurate 
      with the expected ratings.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: World Omni's portfolio and 
      securitization delinquency and loss performance has improved since 2009 
      and has been relatively stable in 2013-2015, despite coming off record 
      lows.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes World Omni 
      to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer for 2015-B as 
      evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2015-B to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. The 
      sensitivity analysis shows a potential downgrade of one category for 
      both classes of notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of two or more rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP (EY). The third-party due diligence focused on an extract of 
      125 retail instalment sale contracts that were selected by EY and 
      verified for details such as customer name and state, interest rate, 
      monthly payment amount, original term, FICO etc. In that sample set all 
      compared information was in agreement. Fitch considered this information 
      in its analysis and concluded that the findings do not impact our 
      analysis.
    

      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary. As such, no adjustments 
      were made to Fitch's analysis.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 
      2015-B--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's June 2015 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

related assets pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, if any, WOAR
shall pay to World Omni the aggregate Starting Principal Balances
for such Subsequent Receivables (with respect to such Receivables,

SECTION
2.03         
Intention of Parties . It is the intention of World Omni and

and treated for all purposes, other than for tax purposes, as) a
true and complete sale of the Receivables identified in the related
RPA Assignment and other property specified in Section 2.01
hereof, conveying good title thereto free and clear of any liens
and encumbrances, from World Omni to WOAR. However, in the event
that any such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge to secure a loan
(in spite of the express intent of the parties hereto that such
conveyance constitutes, and shall be construed and treated for all
purposes, other than for tax purposes, as a true and complete
sale), World Omni hereby grants to WOAR a first priority perfected
security interest in all of World Omni’s right, title and
interest in, to and under the Receivables identified in the related
RPA Assignment and other property specified in Section 2.01
hereof whether now existing or hereafter created to secure the loan
deemed to be made in connection with such pledge and, in such
event, this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under
applicable law.

 

SECTION
2.04          The
Closing . Each sale and purchase of the Receivables shall take
place at a closing at a place, on a date and at a time mutually
agreeable to World Omni and WOAR and may occur simultaneously with
the closing of any related transactions contemplated by (a) the
Sale and Servicing Agreement and (b) the Indenture.

 

SECTION
2.05         
Covenant Regarding Subsequent Receivables . If there is a
Funding Period, World Omni covenants to deliver and sell to WOAR
pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, on or prior to the end of
the Funding Period, Subsequent Receivables with an aggregate
Starting Principal Balance less the Yield Supplement
Overcollateralization Amount for such Subsequent Receivables as of
the related Subsequent Cutoff Date equal to approximately the
result of the Pre-Funding Account Initial Deposit divided by
[RESERVED]% provided that it has originated sufficient Subsequent
Receivables that satisfy the eligibility criteria specified in
Section 2.03 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.
