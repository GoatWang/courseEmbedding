Enhancing Productivity with Syntel’s Production Support Services				  					

               A leading health insurance company was facing issues resolving a large number of tickets stemming from recurring issues. The client decided to make a significant effort
to fix these errors, so Syntel deployed a team of Kanban and Production Support and Maintenance (PSM) experts to quickly and permanently fix them. In doing so, we not only
reduced the ticket count, but also managed to automate a number of time-consuming manual activities.
