 War for the Core! Deep within Cybertron, the ultimate weapon to kill all Transformers is about to be activated! Meanwhile, Elita One plans to stop the weapon-by killing every human on Cybertron! 
Either way, looks like some species on Cybertron is going down unless Optimus Prime and Scarlett can save the day.
Bullet points: * The Hasbro comic book crossover event of 2017 is here! * The wild ride ends here! Who will live? Who will die? What will happen to Cybertron? * Expect both a satisfying conclusion and the start of a whole new era!
