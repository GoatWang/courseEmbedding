PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Fortress Investment Group LLC (NYSE: FIG) announced today the successful close of the Fortress Secured Lending Fund (“FSLF”). The fund was oversubscribed, with total accepted capital of $590 million, nearly 20% over an original target of $500 million.
FSLF will become the primary funding source for the firm’s established specialty finance lending business, which has committed approximately $5 billion across over 80 lender finance transactions since 2006. Led by co-CIOs Pete Briger, Dean Dakolias and Dominick Ruggiero, FSLF is focused on making attractively priced, primarily senior loans secured by diversified portfolios of consumer and small business loans and receivables.
The fund’s senior team, led by Ruggiero, has worked together for approximately 10 years and benefits from deep experience across asset classes, proven sourcing relationships, and extensive structuring and asset management capabilities. Since 2006, Fortress Credit lender finance transactions have generated an unlevered, mark-to-market gross return of 13.0%.
With capital commitments from 56 external investors, including 30 investors new to Fortress, FSLF expands both the product offerings and investor base of the Fortress Credit and Real Estate business, which managed over $18 billion at December 31, 2016.

The fund raised $347 million last September.
PRESS RELEASE
Fortress Paper Announces $40,000,000 Credit Agreement
VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA–(Marketwired – Jan. 20, 2017) – Fortress Paper Ltd. (“Fortress Paper” or the “Company”) (TSX:FTP) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Fortress Bioenergy Ltd. (“FBEL”), as borrower, has entered into a credit agreement with IAM Infrastructure Private Debt Fund LP (“IAM”), as lender, in relation to a $40 million secured loan (the “IAM Loan”) which matures 14 years from the date of advance, and is repayable in monthly payments of principal and interest over the term. The IAM Loan will accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum plus an account maintenance fee of 0.5% per annum and is expected to be advanced in full in ten business days subject to certain customary conditions. FBEL is the owner and operator of the electricity cogeneration facility located at the Fortress Specialty Cellulose Inc. (“FSC”) mill in Thurso, Québec. The IAM Loan is secured against all of the assets of FBEL. The IAM Loan is also guaranteed by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, FSC, and Fortress Paper. 





Investissement Québec (“IQ”), acting on behalf of the government of Québec, has agreed to subordinate its security rights in relation to its outstanding loan with FBEL and FSC in favour of the IAM Loan. In consideration of such subordination, the Company has agreed with IQ to match the interest rate payable on $40 million principal amount of the outstanding IQ loan to that payable pursuant to the IAM Loan. All principal payments on the IQ loan made by the Company will be applied firstly to the higher interest bearing principal amount outstanding.
The Company intends to use the proceeds of the IAM Loan to repay convertible debentures issued by Fortress Paper and for general corporate purposes.
Yvon Pelletier, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are pleased to announce the addition of the IAM Loan as part of our long-term capital structure. Securing the $40 million loan provides us with greater financial flexibility to manage our outstanding indebtedness and thereby support our long-term growth strategy.”
Philip Robson, President of IAM’s Private Debt Group commented, “We are excited to support another operational bio-energy project in the Province of Quebec. Fortress Paper continues to invest in its Thurso, Québec facilities and we are pleased to be part of the financing team.”
About Fortress Paper

The Company operates its dissolving pulp business at the Fortress Specialty Cellulose Mill located in Canada, which has expanded into the renewable energy generation sector with the construction of a cogeneration facility. The Company operates its security paper products business at the Landqart Mill located in Switzerland, where it produces banknote, passport, visa and other brand protection and security papers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
