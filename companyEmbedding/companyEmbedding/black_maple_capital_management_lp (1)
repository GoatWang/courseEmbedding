                        Black Maple Capital is an event-focused alternative investment manager formed in 2013. Black
                        Maple Capital combines the creativity and agility of a boutique manager with the expertise and
                        infrastructure of a well-established institution. The core of our experienced team has
                        successfully worked together for many years through a wide range of market environments. Our
                        team is comprised of multi-disciplinary professionals with proven credit, distressed, event
                        equity and derivatives expertise.
Black Maple Capital's investment approach reflects our contrarian,
                            value-conscious and event-focused investment principles. We emphasize rigorous fundamental
                            analysis, generally complimented with various combinations of event analysis, scenario
                            analysis and quantitative analysis.
Led by our investment Principals and their 21 years of average investment
                            experience, Black Maple Capital's dynamic team collaborated successfully for many years
                            within a large, global, multi-strategy hedge fund. This seasoned group of close-knit
                            professionals is charged with unearthing the most compelling risk-adjusted investment
                            prospects within our core areas of expertise. Unlike many established multi-strategy
                            investment managers, however, we do not allocate capital to investment strategies or
                            autonomous business units. Instead, we identify, filter, and target our collective best
                            ideas with a team emphasis on bottom-line risk-adjusted performance.

 Black Maple Capital is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with additional

                            operations, yet retains the flexibility to grow with our operations.

                    infrastructure of an institutional firm.

Black Maple : Philosophy

Careers
  

  




 


  
 



Investment Philosophy

 Black Maple Capital was
                            conceived upon a series of core principles: 

  

 
 


Versatility We search across our core markets and
                                throughout the capital structure to find the most attractive risk-adjusted investment
                                opportunities. Once selected, we leverage this same multi-disciplinary approach to craft
                                the optimal expression of each core investment, using all of the tools at our disposal.
                            
  
 


Agility We understand that markets move quickly and
                                truly attractive opportunities can be fleeting. Our experienced team is responsive and
                                opportunistic and capable of exploiting opportunities beneath the radar of larger
                                competitors.
                            
  
 


Independence Our team embraces its contrarian nature.
                                We actively question the consensus perspective and promote a culture that encourages
                                “asking the tough questions.” Our Principals encourage multi-disciplinary debate to
                                reach balanced and informed conclusions.
                            
  


 


Risk Management Leveraging risk analytics and systems
                                developed over many years for a large, multi-national hedge fund, our experienced Risk
                                Team is engaged across all stages of our investment process.
                            
  
 


MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES; CONSISTENT PROCESS We emphasize
                                thoughtful fundamental research and event analysis, coupled with other analytical
                                filters where appropriate. While we apply different forms of analysis, the core elements
                                of our investment process are consistent regardless of security, market, or geography.
                            
  
 


“Best Ideas” Portfolio We allocate capital to the
                                team’s best ideas; not to individual portfolio managers, strategies, or markets. We
                                structure incentives to ensure that capital flows to the highest caliber, most inspired
                                investment prospects.
                            
  


 


Discipline We actively monitor the projected
                                investment catalysts to “know what we are playing for” and then exit or re-underwrite
                                positions if our thesis fails to materialize.
                            
  
 


Embrace Complexity We pride ourselves on hunting where
                                others fear to tread. Our team has extensive experience with complex events, including
                                distressed investments, litigation analysis, and regulatory uncertainty, among many
                                others.
                            
  
 


Aligned Interests We invest our capital alongside our
                                investors’ capital.

13F Filings
The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.
