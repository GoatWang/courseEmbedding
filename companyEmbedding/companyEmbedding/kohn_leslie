Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.

FAQs

View all Frequently Asked Questions




Why are some products not available at my local store?


Due to variations in the merchandise inventory from one store to another, some items may be available at your local store and some may not. Certain sizes, styles and colors change frequently so check back often or look for the item you want at another location.


Need to set or change your default store?  
Click My Store at the top of the homepage to select a store.


Who can pick up my order?

You can pick up your order or assign an alternate person to pick up the order. To add an alternate pickup person, enter the first and last name and email address (optional) of the person who will be picking up the order to the Pickup Option section during checkout.

You can add or change the pickup person until your full order has been picked up by going to the Manage Order page in your Account History or by clicking Manage Order from the notification email.


What do I need to pick up my order?


You will need:
  • a government-issued ID
  • your pickup notification email
If you are unable to print your pickup notification email, the Associate can view it on your mobile device.


How long will my order be held at the store?


Your order will be held at the store for seven calendar days. We'll send you a reminder email one day before we cancel the order and return the merchandise to the store floor.
If you need to extend your order pickup window, please contact your selected pickup store, ask to speak with the Customer Service desk and an associate can help you. Store contact information can be found by clicking here.
If we cancel your order, your account will be credited for the amount of the order. Any merchandise credits or Kohl’s Gift Cards used will be refunded with Kohl’s merchandise credit. Kohl's Cash that was used will be refunded with Kohl's Cash. The Kohl's merchandise credit will be mailed and will arrive within 15 days. Kohl's Cash will be emailed or printed in store immediately.


How will I know when my order is ready to be picked up?


You will receive a notification email letting you know it is ready. Orders are typically ready within 2 hours after they are placed online.
If you want to receive a text alert when your order is ready for pickup, you can add your mobile number in the Pickup Option section during checkout.
Note: If you place an order after 5:00 PM (local time), it may not be ready until the following day. This time may also be subject to change during holiday season.


Where do I pick up my order?


All orders should be picked up from the Customer Service desk. Please reference your pickup notification email for specific pickup location details.
When you come to pick up your order, look for the designated "Buy Online, Pick Up in Store" parking spots near the front of the store. You will find these parking spots on the side of the store where the Customer Service desk is located. Don't worry if you have other shopping to do—there is no time limit!
