Why AMC Entertainment Holdings, StoneMor Partners, and XPO Logistics Slumped Today
Even though the market largely held its ground today, these stocks fell. Find out why.











                Dan Caplinger
            

                (TMFGalagan)



            
            Jul 17, 2017 at 4:30PM
            
            





Monday was a quiet start to the week on Wall Street, as major benchmarks eased downward from Friday's close. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials traded on either side of the unchanged line, flirting with making further advances into record territory. Yet even though a strong economic report from China gave international investors further optimism, gains evaporated in the U.S. as oil prices slipped and investors waited to see how the opening days of the new earnings season would go. Bad news from some companies also had a negative impact on investor sentiment, and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), StoneMor Partners (NYSE:STON), and XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Will the lights go out on AMC?
Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings dropped 10% in the wake of negative comments over the weekend from journalists covering the movie theater operator. Barron's released a report noting that AMC and its peers in the theater business have missed out on the bull market in 2017, suffering substantial losses because of rising competition from at-home entertainment options and a lack of original, inspired content from Hollywood. Particularly disturbing is the idea that movie studios might choose to bypass theaters entirely, offering pay-per-view-like options to allow home viewers to pay ultra-premium prices to watch movies at home within days of their initial release. Given all the capital improvements that AMC and its peers have made to modernize theaters and make them more attractive as destinations, that threat could jeopardize their return on substantial investments, and shareholders seemed uncertain how the theater industry will respond.

StoneMor suffers a technical debt default
StoneMor Partners stock declined 10% after the cemetery and funeral home operator gave investors an update on its efforts to restate its financial results. The company said that it still hasn't finished its accounting review, and because it hasn't been able to file its annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pending completion of the review, StoneMor is now in technical default on its revolving credit agreement. The death-care company also foresees that further default events will occur in mid-August, as it believes it's unlikely to be able to file its first-quarter or second-quarter reports quickly enough to meet required deadlines on that front. StoneMor hopes that it will be able to get extensions of time or other waivers with lenders, but the news was still disquieting to investors, who are already gun-shy about the company following its decision last October to slash its dividend.





XPO falls on preliminary results
Finally, shares of XPO Logistics fell 5%. The transportation and logistics specialist released its preliminary second-quarter results, which included total revenue projections of between $3.755 billion and $3.765 billion and operating income of $183 million to $187 million. XPO sees its organic revenue growth coming in between 7% and 7.9%, and cash flow from operations should be between $205 million and $215 million. In addition, XPO said that it would make a secondary offering of its stock, selling 11 million shares to raise capital for general corporate purposes. The company mentioned the possibility of refinancing or paying down debt as well as making strategic acquisitions as possible uses for the funds. Even with today's declines, favorable trends in e-commerce have helped send XPO stock up about 40% so far in 2017.

StoneMor Partners L.P. Provides Update on Accounting Review

TREVOSE, Pa., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- StoneMor Partners L.P.(NYSE:STON) ("StoneMor" or the "Partnership") today provided an update regarding its ongoing review of certain of the Partnership's previously issued consolidated financial statements.  The Partnership is working to complete the review, but at this time it remains ongoing.  The Partnership continues to believe that the revisions to previously reported financial information resulting from this review will principally reflect a net decrease in deferred revenues and deferred selling costs and an increase in partners' capital on its previously reported consolidated balance sheets.  The Partnership also continues to expect that the results of these corrections will have an immaterial impact on cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2016.
The Partnership remains committed to filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Form 10-K") as promptly as practicable, and believes it will be able to do so within the next two to four weeks.  The Partnership's failure to file the Form 10-K before July 15, 2017 was an event of default under its revolving credit agreement.
Additionally, under the terms of its credit agreement, the Partnership is obligated to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 (the "First Quarter 10-Q") within 45 days after the Form 10-K is filed.  The Partnership is also obligated to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017 (the "Second Quarter 10-Q") on or before August 14, 2017.  Because of the ongoing accounting review and the work required to file multiple reports (Form 10-K, First Quarter 10-Q, and Second Quarter 10-Q) in such a condensed time period on or before August 14, 2017, the Partnership believes it is likely that it will not be able to file the Second Quarter 10-Q by that date.  The Partnership has communicated with all its lenders that it will be seeking a waiver or other relief to extend the time for filing the Form 10-K and expects to seek similar relief to extend the time for filing the Second Quarter 10-Q.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements


Certain statements contained in this press release, including, but not limited to, information regarding the restatement of StoneMor's consolidated financial statements, expected timing of filings and efforts to obtain waivers or other relief from the Partnership's lenders are forward-looking statements. Generally, the words "believe," "may," "will," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "project," "expect," "predict" and similar expressions identify these forward-looking statements. 
These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and estimates. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are made subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this press release.  StoneMor's major risks are related to uncertainties associated with the cash flow from pre-need and at-need sales, trusts and financings, which may impact StoneMor's ability to meet its financial projections, service its debt, pay distributions, and increase its distributions, as well as with StoneMor's ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.


StoneMor's additional risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to the following: the difficulty of predicting the timing of the completion of the restatement of its consolidated financial statements, its impact on the Partnership's financial results and the timing of the related filings; additional information arising from the Partnership's continuing analysis and review of its historical recognition of revenue and its prior financial statements and the performance of additional work in this regard, as well as the review and audit by the Partnership's registered independent public accounting firm of the Partnership's prior financial statements; the consequences of the Partnership's delinquent filing of the Form 10-K, including that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could institute an administrative proceeding seeking the revocation of the registration of the Partnership's common units under the Exchange Act, and that the Partnership is delinquent in its required filings with the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and could ultimately face the possible delisting of its common units from the NYSE; the existence of a default under the Partnership's credit facility because the Form 10-K was not filed prior to July 15, 2017; the existence of a default under the indenture governing its senior notes if the Form 10-K and any other delinquent report are not filed within 120 days after notice from the trustee under the indenture; and the Partnership's ability to obtain relief from its creditors under its credit facility or the indenture governing its senior notes, the terms on which such relief might be granted and any restrictions that might be imposed in connection with any relief that might be obtained.


When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements set forth in StoneMor's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports that StoneMor files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, from time to time. Except as required under applicable law, StoneMor assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made herein or any other forward-looking statements made by it, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

StoneMor shares slide 11% after company says it is in default on a credit agreement
Shares of cemetery and funeral home operator StoneMor Parnters L.P.  slid more than 10% Monday, after the company said it is in default on its revolving credit agreement after failing to file its annual 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission by a July 15 deadline. The delay was caused by an accounting review that has not yet been completed. Trevose, Pennsylvania-based StoneMor said that makes it likely that it will miss a separate SEC deadline for its quarterly 10-Q for the March period. "The Partnership has communicated with all its lenders that it will be seeking a waiver or other relief to extend the time for filing the Form 10-K and expects to seek similar relief to extend the time for filing the Second Quarter 10-Q," the company said in a statement. StoneMor said it still expects the review to lead to a net decrease in deferred revenue and selling costs and an increase in partners' capital on its balance sheet. It does not expect any material impact on cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2016. StoneMor is the only publicy traded death care company that is structured as a partnership. Shares are down 10% for 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 10%.

StoneMor shares slide 11% after company says it is in default on a credit agreement
Shares of cemetery and funeral home operator StoneMor Parnters L.P.  slid more than 10% Monday, after the company said it is in default on its revolving credit agreement after failing to file its annual 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission by a July 15 deadline. The delay was caused by an accounting review that has not yet been completed. Trevose, Pennsylvania-based StoneMor said that makes it likely that it will miss a separate SEC deadline for its quarterly 10-Q for the March period. "The Partnership has communicated with all its lenders that it will be seeking a waiver or other relief to extend the time for filing the Form 10-K and expects to seek similar relief to extend the time for filing the Second Quarter 10-Q," the company said in a statement. StoneMor said it still expects the review to lead to a net decrease in deferred revenue and selling costs and an increase in partners' capital on its balance sheet. It does not expect any material impact on cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2016. StoneMor is the only publicy traded death care company that is structured as a partnership. Shares are down 10% for 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 10%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
