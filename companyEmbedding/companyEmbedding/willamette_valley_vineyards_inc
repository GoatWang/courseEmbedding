Looking to stop by here in Mid August. What is the difference between the general tour and the the private tour? Would you do both or one over the other? I get the amount of time is different and the private tour costs money but if we are stopping on our way through to Bend, what do you recommend?

Stewardship of the Land
Willamette Valley Vineyards is dedicated to producing the finest Pinot Noir from grapes grown in the Willamette Valley Appellation. Since the winery founding in 1983, stewardship of the land has been a key principle in our winemaking. Please consider taking a few moments to read about the ways we are addressing global warming.

L.I.V.E. (Low Input Viticulture & Enology) & Salmon-Safe
Environmental Certifications
Our vineyards have been certified sustainable through LIVE (Low Input Viticulture and Enology) and Salmon- Safe since 1997. This includes fifty acres of vinifera at our Estate Vineyard, over 200 acres at Tualatin Estate Vineyard, and sixty acres at Elton Vineyard. LIVE is certified through the International Organization for Biological Control, the international standard for sustainable agriculture. The Whole farm system certification includes preventative measures for water run off into salmon streams, natural pesticide management, riparian areas, and reduced sprays.
In 2011, our Founder, Jim Bernau was recognized by Salmon-Safe with the very first “Hero of Salmon” award for the implementation of his high impact Salmon-Safe “SIP-SAVE” campaign in print, retail, web and vehicle wraps.
To learn more, visit LIVE or Salmon-Safe online.


 
 

 
 





BioDiesel
The Willamette Way
We love our biodiesel! In 2005, Founder Jim Bernau launched the employee biodiesel program; offering fifty gallons of biodiesel a month to each employee, at no cost.  Many employees use the program and employees, delivery vehicles and tractors fill up onsite or at card-lock stations. To learn more about biodiesel, and our provider, please visit SeQuential.
Read more about our eco-friendly biodiesel program.


 
 

 
 





FSC® Certified Cork
Certified through the Rainforest Alliance to FSC standards
Willamette Valley Vineyard is the first winery in the world to use cork certified through the Rainforest Alliance to Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) standards. Cork is a natural, sustainable product where the cork tree is never cut down but continues to sequester carbon throughout its long life. Learn more by visiting Rainforest Alliance.
In 2010, Willamette Valley Vineyards was honored with the Rainforest Alliance’s prestigious  Sustainable Standard-Setter award. Tensie Whelan, President of the Rainforest Alliance, commended the winery for its long-time leadership in agriculture and forestry.
"Willamette Valley Vineyards’ efforts to provide sustainable livelihoods, conserve biodiversity and minimize environmental impacts have solidified
Willamette Valley Vineyards as a leader of sustainable agriculture and forestry, "Whelan said. "Willamette Valley Vineyards has long been at the forefront of environmental conservation through the pursuit of FSC-certified cork, waste management near riparian zones, and investment in alternative fuels."
For more information on FSC®, please visit us.fsc.org.


 
 

 
 





Bottle & Cork Recycling
We offer a 10 cent refund on all wine bottles returned to our tasting room!
In 2005, Founder Jim Bernau won permission from the OLCC to include a ten cent recycling refund statement on our wine labels.  We offer ten cents for each bottle returned to our tasting room and one dollar for returned shippers. Also, because cork is one of the world’s most sustainable agricultural products, we’ve partnered with CorkReharvest.org to begin a nationwide recycling campaign. We recycle the corks into high value products, so consider recycling yours.  Drop the corks off in our tasting room or, to find other recycling locations, visit CorkReHarvest.org
As well as recycling natural corks, the company also uses recycled paper throughout the facility, recycled cardboard shippers, and recycles all plastic, aluminum, paper, and cardboard products.


 
 

 
 



Raptors in the Vineyard
Barn owls and kestrels help protect our vineyards
In 2011 we partnered with the Cascades Raptor Center in Eugene, Oregon to place rehabilitated barn owls and kestrels into our vineyard for natural protection. We hung the first of six barn owl and kestrel nesting boxes around the vineyard. These birds help create a balanced eco-system by controlling pest populations. We continue to introduce birds each year.
Joe Perez, one of our long-standing AWS/OWE members, built the "bird condos" and has now placed them in three of our estate vineyards. 
We'd like to thank Louise Shimmel, Executive Director of the non-profit Cascades Raptor Center for all of her work to make this possible. To find out more about the Cascade Raptors Center, please visit their website.

Energy Efficiency
Solar Energy
Willamette Valley Vineyards has invested in four solar energy projects with Advanced Energy Systems. These include two solar electric installations (458 panels in total) providing 139,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. In addition, a 12 collector solar water heating system supplies a major portion of the hot water needed for the winery kitchen and bottling operations. On an equivalent basis, these solar power facilities offset the emissions from the consumption of 11,917 gallons of gasoline, amounting to a reduction of 117 tons of CO2 emissions each year.
Electric Vehicle Charging
Guests of the winery are welcome to use either of the dual-head electric car charging stations located in the hospitality parking lot to the right as you pass our main entry into the tasting room. Look for the "EV" logo painted on the designated parking spaces while using this free service.


 
 

 
 



Willamette Valley Oak Accord
Willamette Valley Vineyards is one of the founding signatories of Willamette Valley Oak Accord, a grassroots effort to protect and restore remaining oak habitat in the Willamette Valley. This is an important conservation effort that will preserve natural resources within our region.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.

Willamette Valley Vineyards at Tualatin Estate

Tualatin Estate Vineyard, established in 1973, is one of the oldest and most respected vineyard sites in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. Wine grapes from this 145-acre vineyard have produced world-renowned wines for over 38 years. Tualatin is the only vineyard to have won the Best of Show for both the red and white categories at the London International Wine Competition in the same year.
Tualatin’s Pinot Noir captured the Governor’s Trophy, Oregon’s most prestigious wine award, two years consecutively in 1994 and 1995. This is a feat unduplicated by any  Oregon winery. Tualatin Estate Vineyard is proudly owned through a merger accomplished in 1997 with Willamette Valley Vineyards.
The name “Tualatin” originates from local indigenous people and means “gentle and easy flowing,” referring to the local Tualatin River that meanders on its way to the confluence with the Willamette River. The site is located in the coastal rain shadows near Forest Grove, Oregon. It is planted with sixty-five acres of Pinot Noir, fifteen acres of Chardonnay, twenty-nine acres of Riesling, six acres of Gewürztraminer, ten acres of Muscat, and nine acres of Pinot Blanc. Our most recent plantings reflect the site’s affinity to ripening Pinot Noir, with forty-five new acres planted to seven different French clones, all grafted onto phylloxera-resistant rootstock. The new plantings are spaced at twice the plant density of the original vineyard to improve vineyard ripening potential by limiting the crop on a per plant basis. This will yield wines that are more consistent from year to year as well as more complex structurally due to the clonal diversity.
