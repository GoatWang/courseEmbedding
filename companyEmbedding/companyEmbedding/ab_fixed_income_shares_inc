1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively.

Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES:  The Portfolio is a money market fund that seeks to maintain a stable net asset value, or NAV, of $1.00 per share although there is no guarantee that the Portfolio will maintain a NAV of $1.00
per share.  The Portfolio invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, marketable obligations (which may bear adjustable rates of
interest) issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities (U.S. Government securities) and repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully. Collateralized fully means collateralized by cash or
government securities.  The Portfolio also invests at least 80%, and normally substantially all, of its net assets in U.S. Government
securities and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by U.S. Government securities. This policy may not be changed without 60 days prior written notice to shareholders.  As a money market fund, the Portfolio must meet the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) Rule 2a-7. The Rule imposes strict conditions on the investment quality,
maturity, diversification, and liquidity of the Portfolios investments. Among other things, Rule 2a-7 requires that the Portfolios investments have (i) a remaining maturity of no more than 397 days unless otherwise permitted by Rule
2a-7, (ii) a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 60 days, and (iii) a weighted average life that does not exceed 120 days. For purposes of calculating weighted average maturity, the maturity of an adjustable rate security
generally will be the period remaining until its next interest rate adjustment. For purposes of calculating 
  4 


Table of Contents

weighted average life, the life of an adjustable rate security will be its stated final maturity, without regard to interest rate adjustments. Rule 2a-7 imposes liquidity standards that require
the Portfolio to hold at least 10% and 30% of its total assets in daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets, respectively, as defined in Rule 2a-7. Rule 2a-7 also limits the Portfolios investments in illiquid securities to 5% of its total
assets.  The Portfolio may also invest in when-issued securities and the securities of other money market funds to the extent permitted under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  PRINCIPAL RISKS: 



 
 Money Market Fund Risk and Regulatory Developments: Money market funds are sometimes unable to maintain an NAV at $1.00 per share and, as it is
generally referred to, break the buck. In that event, an investor in a money market fund would, upon redemption, receive less than $1.00 per share. The Portfolios shareholders should not rely on or expect an affiliate of the
Portfolio to purchase distressed assets from the Portfolio, make capital infusions, enter into credit support agreements or take other actions to prevent the Portfolio from breaking the buck. In addition, you should be aware that significant
redemptions by large investors in the Portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the Portfolios other shareholders. The Portfolios NAV could be affected by forced selling during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid
markets. Money market funds are also subject to regulatory risk.     Under
recently adopted changes to Rule 2a-7, the Portfolio is permitted, but not required, at the discretion of the Portfolios Board of Directors, under certain circumstances of impaired liquidity of the Portfolios investments, to impose
liquidity fees of up to 2% on, or suspend, redemptions for limited periods of time. The Portfolios Board of Directors has determined not to impose liquidity fees on, or suspend, redemptions under any circumstances. 
 



 
 Interest Rate Risk: Changes in interest rates will affect the yield and value of the Portfolios investments in short-term securities. A
decline in interest rates will affect the Portfolios yield as these securities mature or are sold and the Portfolio purchases new short-term securities with lower yields. Generally, an increase in interest rates causes the value of a debt
instrument to decrease. The change in value for shorter-term securities is usually smaller than for securities with longer maturities.   



 
 Credit Risk: Credit risk is the possibility that a securitys credit rating will be downgraded or that the issuer of the security will
default (fail to make scheduled interest and principal payments). The Portfolios investments in U.S. Government securities or related repurchase agreements have minimal credit risk compared to other investments. 
 



 
 Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell, which may prevent the Portfolio from
selling out of these securities at an advantageous time or price.   



 
 Management Risk: The Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its
investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Portfolio, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the intended results.  You could lose money by investing in the Portfolio. Although the Portfolio seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the
Portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Portfolios sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Portfolio, and you should not expect that
the sponsor will provide financial support to the Portfolio at any time.  BAR CHART AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION 
The bar chart and performance information provide an indication of the historical risk of an investment in the Portfolio by showing: 
 



 
 how the Portfolios performance changed from year to year over the life of the Portfolio; and 
 



 
 the Portfolios average annual returns for one year, five years, and since inception. 
The Portfolios past performance, of course, does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future. The Portfolio adopted a multiple-class
plan effective June 1, 2016. Upon the adoption of the multiple-class plan by the Portfolio, the original share class of the Portfolio (original share class) was renamed Class AB shares. Accordingly, the performance information
presented below for the Class AB shares for periods prior to June 1, 2016 is the performance information of the original share class that existed prior to such date. In addition, because the original share class did not pay a management fee to
the Adviser, performance for such periods does not reflect the effect of the current management fee on the performance.  You may obtain updated
performance information on the website at www.ABglobal.com (click on MenuAmericasIndividual InvestorsUS (US Citizens), then InvestmentsMutual Funds).

Bar Chart  The annual returns in the bar chart are for the Portfolios Class AB shares, or, as noted above, the original share class. Through March 31, 2016, the year-to-date unannualized return for the
Portfolios Class AB shares was 0.09%.    

 During the period shown in the bar chart, the Portfolios: 
Best Quarter was up 1.30%, 2nd quarter, 2007; and Worst Quarter was up 0.02%, 2nd quarter 2015.  Performance Table  Average Annual Total Returns

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES 
If you purchase shares of the Portfolio through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank or a group retirement plan), the Portfolio
and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Portfolio shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other financial intermediary and your salesperson to
recommend the Portfolio over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediarys website for more information.

INVESTING IN THE PORTFOLIO
     This section discusses how to buy, sell or redeem, or exchange different classes of shares of the Portfolio that are offered in this Prospectus. The Portfolio offers two classes of shares through this
Prospectus.  Each share class represents an investment in the same portfolio of securities. 
HOW TO BUY SHARES 
The purchase of the Portfolios shares is priced at the next-determined NAV after your order is received in proper form. 
Class AB Shares  Class AB shares are available to
other registered investment companies or collective investment trusts advised by the Adviser and other affiliated accounts. Class AB shares are also available for the investment of cash collateral related to the AB Mutual Funds securities
lending programs.  Institutional Class SharesMinimum Investments  Institutional Class shares are available to institutional investors. The minimum initial investment for Institutional Class shares in the Portfolio is $1,000,000 (Minimum Investment). There is
no minimum amount for subsequent investments although the Portfolio reserves the right to impose a minimum investment amount. There is no minimum amount for reinvestment of dividends and distributions declared by the Portfolio in the shares of the
Portfolio.  The Minimum Investment may be made over a 60-day period following an initial investment of less than the Minimum Investment. For
these situations, the Portfolio requests that a client confirm to the Adviser that the client intends to invest at least $1,000,000 in shares of the Portfolio within 60 days. If a client fails to invest the Minimum Investment over the 60-day period,
the Adviser may redeem the clients shares.  For clients of the Advisers investment-management services, the Adviser may, at a
clients request, maintain a specified percentage of assets in the Portfolio or vary the percentage based on the Advisers opinion of market conditions. In keeping with these client mandates or for tax considerations, the Adviser may,
without additional instructions from the client, purchase shares of the Portfolio from time to time. These purchases and sales by the Adviser will not be subject to the minimum investment requirement specified above. 
Other Purchase Information  Your broker or
financial advisor must receive your purchase request by the Portfolio Closing Time, which is the close of regular trading on any day the Exchange is open (ordinarily, 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, but sometimes earlier, as in the case of scheduled
half-day trading or unscheduled suspensions of trading) and submit it to the Portfolio by a pre-arranged time for you to receive the next-determined NAV.  If you are an existing Portfolio shareholder and you have completed the appropriate section of the Mutual Fund Application, you may purchase additional shares by telephone with payment by electronic funds
transfer in amounts not exceeding $500,000. AllianceBernstein Investor Services, Inc., or ABIS, must receive and confirm telephone requests before the Portfolio Closing Time to receive that days public offering price. Call 800-221-5672 to
arrange a transfer from your bank account.  Shares of the Portfolio are generally available for purchase in the United States, Puerto Rico,
Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Portfolio, the Portfolio will only accept purchase orders directly from U.S. citizens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) or resident
aliens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) and a U.S. taxpayer identification number (i.e., W-9 tax status). Subject to the requirements of local law applicable to the offering of Portfolio shares, U.S. citizens
(i.e., W-9 tax status) residing in foreign countries are permitted to purchase shares of the Portfolio through their accounts at U.S. registered broker/dealers and other similar U.S. financial intermediaries, provided the broker-dealer or
intermediary has an agreement with the Portfolios distributor permitting it to accept orders for the purchase and sale of Portfolio shares.  The Portfolio will not accept purchase orders (including orders for the purchase of additional shares) from foreign persons or entities or from resident aliens who, to the knowledge of the Portfolio, have
reverted to non-resident status (e.g., a resident alien who has a non-U.S. address at time of purchase).  Required Information 
The Portfolio is required by law to obtain, verify and record certain personal information from you or persons on your behalf in order to establish an
account. Required information includes name, date of birth, permanent residential address and taxpayer identification number (for most investors, your social security number). The Portfolio may also ask to see other identifying documents. If you do
not provide the information, the Portfolio will not be able to open your account. If the Portfolio is unable to verify your identity, or that of another person(s) authorized to act on your behalf, or, if the Portfolio believes it has identified
potentially criminal activity, the Portfolio reserves the right to take action it deems appropriate or as required by law, which may include closing your account. If you are not a U.S. citizen or resident alien, your account must be affiliated with
a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, member firm.  The Portfolio is required to withhold 28% of taxable dividends, capital
gains distributions, and redemptions paid to any shareholder who has not provided the Portfolio with his or her correct taxpayer identification number. To avoid this, you must provide your correct tax identification number on your Mutual Fund
Application.

Table of Contents
General  IRA custodians, plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries, plan recordkeepers, and other financial intermediaries may establish their own eligibility requirements as to the purchase, sale or exchange of Portfolio
shares, including minimum and maximum investment requirements. The Portfolio is not responsible for, and has no control over, the decisions of any plan sponsor, fiduciary or other financial intermediary to impose such differing requirements.
AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., or ABI, may refuse any order to purchase shares. The Portfolio reserves the right to suspend the sale of its shares to the public in response to conditions in the securities markets or for other reasons.
 OTHER PAYMENTS FOR DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT 
ABI, at its expense, currently provides additional payments to firms that sell shares of the AB Mutual Funds. Although the individual components may be
higher and the total amount of payments made to each qualifying firm in any given year may vary, the total amount paid to a financial intermediary in connection with the sale of shares of the AB Mutual Funds will generally not exceed the sum of
(a) 0.25% of the current years fund sales by that firm and (b) 0.10% of average daily net assets attributable to that firm over the year. These sums include payments for distribution analytical data regarding AB Mutual Fund sales by
financial advisors of these firms and to reimburse directly or indirectly the costs incurred by these firms and their employees in connection with educational seminars and training efforts about the AB Mutual Funds for the firms employees
and/or their clients and potential clients. The costs and expenses associated with these efforts may include travel, lodging, entertainment and meals. ABI may pay a portion of ticket or other transactional charges. 
For 2016, ABIs additional payments to these firms for distribution services and educational support related to the AB Mutual Funds are expected to
be approximately 0.05% of the average monthly assets of the AB Mutual Funds, or approximately $21 million. In 2015, ABI paid approximately 0.05% of the average monthly assets of the AB Mutual Funds or approximately $21 million for distribution
services and educational support related to the AB Mutual Funds.  A number of factors are considered in determining the additional payments,
including each firms AB Mutual Fund sales, assets and redemption rates, and the willingness and ability of the firm to give ABI access to its financial advisors for educational and marketing purposes. In some cases, firms will include the AB
Mutual Funds on a preferred list. ABIs goal is to make the financial advisors who interact with current and prospective investors and shareholders more knowledgeable about the AB Mutual Funds so that they can provide suitable
information and advice about the funds and related investor services.  The Portfolio and ABI also make payments for recordkeeping and other
transfer agency services to financial intermediaries that sell AB Mutual Fund shares. Please see Management of the PortfolioTransfer Agency and Retirement Plan Services below. These expenses paid by the Portfolio are included in
Other Expenses under Fees and Expenses of the PortfolioAnnual Operating Expenses in the Summary Information at the beginning of this Prospectus. 
 
If one mutual fund sponsor makes greater distribution assistance payments than another, your financial
advisor and his or her firm may have an incentive to recommend one fund complex over another. Similarly, if your financial advisor or his or her firm receives more distribution assistance for one share class versus another, then they may have an
incentive to recommend that class.  Please speak with your financial advisor to learn
more about the total amounts paid to your financial advisor and his or her firm by the Portfolio, the Adviser, ABI and by sponsors of other mutual funds he or she may recommend to you. You should also consult disclosures made by your financial
advisor at the time of purchase.  As of the date of this Prospectus, ABI anticipates that the firms that will receive additional
payments for distribution services and/or educational support include:  Advisor Group, Inc. 
Ameriprise Financial Services  AXA Advisors  Cadaret, Grant & Co. 
Citigroup Global Markets  Citizens Securities  Commonwealth Financial Network 
Donegal Securities  JP Morgan Securities  Lincoln Financial Advisors Corp. 
Lincoln Financial Securities Corp.  LPL Financial  Merrill Lynch 
Morgan Stanley 
Northwestern Mutual Investment Services  PNC Investments  Raymond James 
RBC Wealth Management  Robert W. Baird  Santander Securities 
SunTrust Bank 
UBS Financial Services  US Bancorp Investments  Wells Fargo Advisors 
Although the Portfolio may use brokers and dealers that sell shares of the Portfolio to effect portfolio transactions, the Portfolio does not consider the
sale of AB Mutual Fund shares as a factor when selecting brokers or dealers to effect portfolio transactions.  HOW TO
EXCHANGE SHARES  You may exchange your Portfolio shares for shares of the same class of other AB Mutual Funds provided that the other fund

  9 


Table of Contents

offers the same class of shares. All exchanges are subject to the minimum investment restrictions set forth in the prospectus for the AB Mutual Fund whose shares are being acquired. Your exchange
of shares is priced at the next-determined NAV after your order is received in proper form. You may request an exchange by mail or telephone. In order to receive a days NAV, ABIS must receive and confirm your telephone exchange request by the
Portfolio Closing Time on that day. The Portfolio may modify, restrict, or terminate the exchange privilege on 60 days written notice.  
HOW TO SELL OR REDEEM SHARES  Investors may redeem shares on any day the Exchange is open, either directly or through your
financial intermediary. Redemption requests for Portfolio shares are effected at the next-determined NAV, after the Portfolio receives a sales request in proper form. A redemption request received prior to the Portfolio Closing Time, which is the
close of regular trading on any day the Exchange is open (ordinarily, 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, but sometimes earlier, as in the case of scheduled half-day trading or unscheduled suspensions of trading), is effected on that day. A redemption request
received after that time is effected on the next business day. Normally, redemption proceeds are sent to you within seven days. If you recently purchased your shares by check or electronic funds transfer, your redemption payment may be delayed until
the Portfolio is reasonably satisfied that the check or electronic funds transfer has been collected (which may take up to 10 days).  The
Portfolio may suspend the right of redemption or postpone the payment date at times when the Exchange is closed, or during certain other periods as permitted under the federal securities laws. The Portfolio reserves the right to redeem shares of any
investor at the then-current value of such shares (which will be paid promptly to the investor) if the investor ceases to be a qualified investor, as determined by the Adviser. Affected investors will receive advance notice of any such mandatory
redemption.  Under certain circumstances, the Portfolio may determine to pay a redemption request wholly or partly by a distribution in kind of
securities from its portfolio, instead of cash.  Selling Shares Through Your Broker or Financial Advisor 
Your broker or financial advisor must receive your sales request by the Portfolio Closing Time and submit it to the Portfolio by a prearranged time for
you to receive that days NAV. Your broker or financial advisor is responsible for submitting all necessary documentation to the Portfolio and may charge you a fee for this service.  Selling Shares Directly to the Portfolio By Mail

QUENT PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF PORTFOLIO SHARES  The AB Mutual Funds Directors have adopted policies and procedures designed
to detect and deter frequent purchases and redemptions of AB mutual fund shares or excessive or short-term trading that may disadvantage long-term fund shareholders. As a money market fund that seeks to maintain a

  10 


Table of Contents

constant NAV of $1.00 per share, the Portfolio is not an effective vehicle for short-term trading activity. The Portfolio reserves the right to restrict, reject or cancel, without any prior
notice, any purchase or exchange order for any reason.  HOW THE PORTFOLIO VALUES ITS SHARES 
The Portfolios NAV, which is the price at which shares of the Portfolio are sold and redeemed, is expected to be constant at $1.00 per share,
although this price is not guaranteed. The NAV is calculated on any day the Exchange is open at the close of regular trading (ordinarily, 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, but sometimes earlier, as in the case of scheduled half-day trading or unscheduled
suspensions of trading). Generally, the NAV is not calculated, and purchase and redemption orders are not accepted, on days that the Exchange is closed; however, the Portfolio may elect to, but is not required to, remain open for the purposes of
processing certain transactions (excluding exchanges into and out of the Portfolio) and calculating the NAV even on days that the Exchange is closed in the following circumstances:  1) The Federal Reserve System is open;  2) The primary trading markets for the Portfolios
portfolio instruments are open; and  3) The Adviser believes there is an adequate market to meet purchase and redemption requests. 
The calculation of NAV in such circumstances will ordinarily be made when the Portfolio closes for business on that day. 
To calculate NAV, the Portfolios assets are valued and totaled, liabilities are subtracted, and the balance, called net assets, is divided by the
number of shares outstanding. The Portfolio values its securities at their amortized cost. This method involves valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter applying a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium, regardless of
the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the investment.

MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIO
     INVESTMENT ADVISER  The Portfolios investment adviser is AllianceBernstein L.P., 1345 Avenue of
the Americas, New York, New York 10105. The Adviser is a leading international investment adviser supervising client accounts with assets as of March 31, 2016 totaling approximately $479 billion (of which over $97 billion represented assets of
registered investment companies). As of March 31, 2016, the Adviser managed retirement assets for many of the largest public and private employee benefit plans (including 18 of the nations FORTUNE 100 companies), for public employee
retirement funds across 25 states and the District of Columbia, for investment companies, and for foundations, endowments, banks and insurance companies worldwide. The 32 registered investment companies managed by the Adviser, comprising
approximately 132 separate investment portfolios, had as of March 31, 2016 approximately 2.7 million shareholder accounts.  The
Adviser provides investment advisory services and order placement facilities for the Portfolio. Effective June 1, 2016, the Portfolio pays the Adviser a management fee at an annualized rate of 0.20% as a percentage of the Portfolios
average daily net assets. Prior to June 1, 2016, the Adviser received no advisory fee from the Portfolio. A discussion regarding the basis for the approval of the Portfolios investment advisory agreement by the Board of Directors of AB
Fixed-Income Shares, Inc. will be available in the Portfolios annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. 
TRANSFER AGENCY AND RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES  ABIS
acts as the transfer agent for the Portfolio. ABIS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Adviser, registers the transfer, issuance and redemption of Portfolio shares and disburses dividends and other distributions to Portfolio shareholders.
 Many Portfolio shares are owned by financial intermediaries for the benefit of their customers. Retirement plans may also hold Portfolio
shares in the name of the plan, rather than the participant. In those cases, the Portfolio often does not maintain an account for you. Thus, some or all of the transfer agency functions for these and certain other accounts are performed by the
financial intermediaries and plan recordkeepers. The Portfolio, ABI and/or the Adviser pay these financial intermediaries and recordkeepers, including those that sell shares of the AB Mutual Funds, fees for sub-transfer agency and recordkeeping
services in amounts ranging up to $19 per customer fund account per annum and/or up to 0.25% per annum of the average daily assets held through the intermediary. To the extent any of these payments for recordkeeping services or transfer agency
services are made by the Portfolio, they are included in the amount appearing opposite the caption Other Expenses in the Summary Information at the beginning of this Prospectus. In addition, financial intermediaries may be affiliates of
entities that receive compensation from the Adviser or ABI for maintaining retirement plan platforms that facilitate trading by affiliated and non-affiliated financial intermediaries and recordkeeping for retirement plans. 
Because financial intermediaries and plan recordkeepers may be paid varying amounts per class for sub-transfer agency and related recordkeeping services,
the service requirements of which may also vary by class, this may create an additional incentive for financial intermediaries and their financial advisors to favor one fund complex over another or one class of shares over another. 
For more information, please refer to the Portfolios SAI, call your financial advisor or visit our website at www.ABglobal.com.

Table of Contents
DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES
     The Portfolios net income is calculated at the Portfolio Closing Time, and paid as dividends to shareholders. The dividends are automatically invested in additional shares in your account. These
additional shares are entitled to dividends on the following days resulting in compounding growth of income.  The Portfolio expects that its
distributions will primarily consist of net income, or, if any, short-term capital gains as opposed to long-term capital gains. For Federal income tax purposes, the Portfolios dividend distributions of net income (or short-term capital gains)
that are not tax-exempt will be taxable to you as ordinary income. Any distributions attributable to long-term capital gains of the Portfolio may be taxable to you as long-term capital gains. The Portfolios distributions also may be subject to
certain state and local taxes.  Each year shortly after December 31, the Portfolio will send tax information to shareholders stating the
amount and type of all of its distributions for the year. The Portfolio is required to withhold 28% of taxable dividends, capital gains distributions, if any, and redemptions paid to shareholders who have not provided the Portfolio with their
correct taxpayer identification number. To avoid this, a shareholder must provide a correct taxpayer identification number.  You are encouraged
to consult your tax adviser about the Federal, state and local tax consequences in your particular circumstances.

Table of Contents
GENERAL INFORMATION 
    Under unusual circumstances, the Portfolio may suspend redemptions or postpone payment for up to seven days or longer as permitted by federal securities law. The Portfolio reserves the right to close an
account that has remained below $1,000 for 90 days.  During drastic economic or market developments, you might have difficulty in reaching ABIS
by telephone, in which event you should issue written instructions to ABIS. ABIS is not responsible for the authenticity of telephone requests to purchase, sell, or exchange shares. ABIS will employ reasonable procedures to verify that telephone
requests are genuine, and could be liable for losses resulting from unauthorized transactions if it failed to do so. Dealers and agents may charge a commission for handling telephone requests. The telephone service may be suspended or terminated at
any time without notice.  Shareholder Services. ABIS offers a variety of shareholder services. For more information about these services
or your account, call ABISs toll-free number, 800-221-5672. Some services are described in the Mutual Fund Application. 
Householding. Many shareholders of the AB Mutual Funds have family members living in the same home who also own shares of the same funds. In order
to reduce the amount of duplicative mail that is sent to homes with more than one fund account and to reduce expenses of the fund, all AB Mutual Funds will, until notified otherwise, send only one copy of each prospectus, shareholder report and
proxy statement to each household address. This process, known as householding, does not apply to account statements, confirmations, or personal tax information. If you do not wish to participate in householding, or wish to discontinue
householding at any time, call ABIS at 800-221-5672. We will resume separate mailings for your account within 30 days of your request. 
Portfolio Holdings. Detailed information about the Portfolios portfolio holdings as of the last day of the most recent calendar month is
posted on the Advisers website at www.ABglobal.com/abcom/Product_Center/3_Vehicle/MF/ MoneyMarkets/Government_Money_Market.htm (click on Literature, then Money Market Holdings). This information is updated within five
business days after the end of each month and will remain available online for at least six months. The information provides a link to the Commissions website where the most recent 12 months of publicly available information filed by the
Portfolio may be obtained. The Portfolios Statement of Additional Information (SAI) includes a description of the policies and procedures that apply to disclosure of the Portfolios portfolio holdings.

Table of Contents
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
    The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the Portfolios financial performance for the past five years and the semi-annual period ended October 31, 2015. The table
includes financial information for the original share class only because the Portfolios other class of shares had not commenced operations prior to the date of this Prospectus. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor
would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the Portfolio (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). The financial statements for all fiscal periods, except the semi-annual period ended October 31, 2015, have been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Portfolio. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm, along with the Portfolios financial statements, is included in the
Portfolios annual report, which is available upon request.

APPENDIX A 
    Hypothetical Investment and Expense Information   
A settlement agreement between the Adviser and the New York State Attorney General requires the Portfolio to include the following supplemental
hypothetical investment information which provides additional information calculated and presented in a manner different from expense information found under Fees and Expenses of the Portfolio in this Prospectus about the effect of the
Portfolios expenses, including investment advisory fees and other Portfolio costs, on the Portfolios returns over a 10-year period. The chart shows the estimated expenses that would be charged on a hypothetical investment of $10,000 in
Class AB shares of the Portfolio assuming a 5% return each year. Except as otherwise indicated, the chart also assumes that the current annual expense ratio stays the same throughout the 10-year period. The current annual expense ratio for the
Portfolio is the same as stated under Financial Highlights. If you wish to obtain hypothetical investment information for the other class of shares of the Portfolio, please refer to the Hypothetical Fee and Expense Calculator
on www.ABglobal.com (click on MenuAmericasIndividual InvestorsUS (US Citizens), then InvestmentsCalculators). Your actual expenses may be higher or lower.

AB Fixed-Income Shares, Inc.  Government Money Market Portfolio  July 31, 2016 (unaudited) 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP regarding fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the price that the Portfolio would receive to sell an asset or
pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability (including those valued based on their market values). Inputs may be observable or unobservable and refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Portfolio. Unobservable inputs reflect the Portfolios
own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. Each investment is assigned a level based upon the observability of the inputs
which are significant to the overall valuation. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below.   


 

 
 Level 1quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 


 

 
 Level 2other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
etc.) 


 

 
 Level 3significant unobservable inputs (including the Portfolios own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
 The fair value of debt instruments, such as bonds, and over-the-counter derivatives is generally based on market price
quotations, recently executed market transactions (where observable) or industry recognized modeling techniques and are generally classified as Level 2. Pricing vendor inputs to Level 2 valuations may include quoted prices for similar investments in
active markets, interest rate curves, coupon rates, currency rates, yield curves, option adjusted spreads, default rates, credit spreads and other unique security features in order to estimate the relevant cash flows which is then discounted to
calculate fair values. If these inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value, these investments will be classified as Level 3. In addition, non-agency rated investments are classified as Level 3. 
Other fixed income investments, including non-U.S. government and corporate debt, are generally valued using quoted market prices, if available, which
are typically impacted by current interest rates, maturity dates and any perceived credit risk of the issuer. Additionally, in the absence of quoted market prices, these inputs are used by pricing vendors to derive a valuation based upon industry or
proprietary models which incorporate issuer specific data with relevant yield/spread comparisons with more widely quoted bonds with similar key characteristics. Those investments for which there are observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Where
the inputs are not observable, the investments are classified as Level 3.  The following table summarizes the valuation of the
Portfolios investments by the above fair value hierarchy levels as of July 31, 2016:

(a)
There were no transfers between any levels during the reporting period.  The Portfolio recognizes all transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy assuming the financial instruments were transferred at the beginning of the reporting period. 
The Adviser established the Valuation Committee (the Committee) to oversee the pricing and valuation of all securities held in the Portfolio.
The Committee operates under pricing and valuation policies and procedures established by the Adviser and approved by the Board, including pricing policies which set forth the mechanisms and processes to be employed on a daily basis to implement
these policies and procedures. In particular, the pricing policies describe how to determine market quotations for securities and other instruments. The Committees responsibilities include: 1) fair value and liquidity determinations (and
oversight of any third parties to whom any responsibility for fair value and liquidity determinations is delegated), and 2) regular monitoring of the Advisers pricing and valuation policies and procedures and modification or enhancement of
these policies and procedures (or recommendation of the modification of these policies and procedures) as the Committee believes appropriate. 
The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of the pricing policies by the Advisers Pricing Group (the Pricing
Group) and a third party which performs certain pricing functions in accordance with the pricing policies. The Pricing Group is responsible for the oversight of the third party on a day-to-day basis. The Committee and the Pricing Group perform
a series of activities to provide reasonable assurance of the accuracy of prices including: 1) periodic vendor due diligence meetings, review of methodologies, new developments and process at vendors, 2) daily compare of security valuation versus
prior day for all securities that exceeded established thresholds, and 3) daily review of unpriced, stale, and variance reports with exceptions reviewed by senior management and the Committee. 


In addition, several processes outside of the pricing process are used to monitor valuation issues
including: 1) performance and performance attribution reports are monitored for anomalous impacts based upon benchmark performance, and 2) portfolio managers review all portfolios for performance and analytics (which are generated using the
Advisers prices).

1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.
