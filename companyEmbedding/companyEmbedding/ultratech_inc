Lighting The Way
As a company, Ultratech is in many ways synonymous with light. We are focused on serving three core markets, the first being advanced packaging where we remain the market leader due to our high productivity lithography steppers. Next we supply the logic market with our millisecond laser annealing systems. And, our most recent market segment, optical-based patterned wafer inspection served with our Superfast systems. We believe our expertise in light-based technologies, across these distinct markets, is positioning us for stable growth in a volatile industry. And in a literal sense our optical-technology-based tools are lighting the way, when it comes to the production of advanced semiconductor devices.

About Us
Products for a Cleaner, Safer World
The founders of UltraTech International pioneered the field of spill containment products in the early 1980’s. UltraTech was formed in 1993 with one goal in mind: to create the world’s finest offering of spill containment and spill response products. Since then, its vision has expanded into additional product categories and the company now features a product line that consists of over 300 unique products.

MEET  SOME OF THE ULTRATECH TEAM
Focusing intensely on meeting customer needs in an innovative and cost-effective manner, the company has introduced an average of 20 new products per year. UltraTech's design and development team is credited with nearly 50 patents. Its lines of “problem solver” products are market leaders in the following categories:

Spill Containment
Stormwater Management
Facility Protection
Construction Compliance
Oil Spill
Microbes
Rad Waste Management

The Spill Containment product line is the most extensive in the world. Using molded polyethylene, polyurethane and polymer-coated fabrics as the primary materials of choice, these “secondary containment” products are engineered to capture hazardous material spills from a wide variety of vessels, including laboratory bottles, drums, IBC tanks, stationary tanks, machinery, tanker trucks and railcars. The Stormwater Management product line features an array of products designed to filter contaminants (i.e. sediment, oil and chemicals) from Stormwater runoff, stop hazardous spills from entering storm drains and to protect drums and tanks from outdoor elements. The Facility Protection product line is comprised of many practical products that are designed to protect facility structures and grounds. Various items protect walls, I-beams, etc., against physical damage while others protect against damage caused by uncontrolled fluid flow including water, chemicals and oil. The product line helps reduce maintenance costs while enhancing the appearance of a facility overall. The Construction Compliance product line consists of a complete line of erosion control, Stormwater management and spill containment products. The products are user-friendly and cost-effective, and allow a general contractor or site developer to “one stop shop” their needs. UltraTech products have been designed to meet a variety of environmental regulations:

EPA’s Container Storage Regulations are in place to keep hazardous spills off of plant floors and out of the environment.
New Stormwater Management Regulations, a key component of the EPA’s Clean Water Act, have been enacted to keep sediment, oil and chemicals out of storm drains, groundwater and waterways.
The SPCC Regulations were specifically written to protect the environment from spills of oil and oil-related products

Click here to learn more about these important federal government regulations. The company also specializes in the development of engineered products to safely transport, handle and store radioactive wastes. These items include radwaste filters, lined boxes and drums, drum spacers, neutron shielding and macroencapsulation containers. Visit our Radwaste products for more information. UltraTech’s manufacturing facility is located in northeast Ohio, an excellent location to ship throughout North America. The 100,000+ square foot factory is ISO 9002 certified and features state-of-the-art rotational molding machines and assembly operations. UltraTech products are available throughout North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean through an extensive network of safety, industrial and environmental products distributors. Field support is provided by knowledgeable and experienced manufacturer representatives and company personnel.

Ultra-Containment Wall®




Modular, hard-walled system provides long-term, high-capacity spill containment
Spill containment comes in all types of shapes and sizes.  And when it comes to containing really large vessels like frac tanks, tanker trucks and other large vehicles the Ultra-Containment Berm is often the solution.  But when spill containment needs to be "super sized", a product like the Ultra-Containment Wall is necessary.  The hard-walled, high-capacity spill containment system is ideal for multiple vehicle containment areas like those found in the oilfields or when a taller wall / more containment capacity is necessary. The modular walls and corners can be quickly set up and reconfigured as containment needs change.

Modular wall sections and corners can be easily assembled to form almost any size/shape spill containment area needed.
Heavy-duty, 30 mil, textured polyethylene liner provides rugged, impermeable barrier to capture leaks and spills.
Creates large, semi-permanent containment areas. Provides significantly more gallon capacity than shorter walled containment systems.
Versatile system can be easily disassembled for reuse at future sites.
Unlike some containment systems, the Ultra-Containment Wall is not secured to the substrate so it is perfect for use in parking lots, sand, rocky soil, muddy soil, frozen soil or on concrete areas.
Made in the USA. Stock/warehousing: Texas.
Meets SPCC, EPA Container Storage Regulation 40 CFR 264.175.

Frequently Asked Questions
How long are the wall sections of the Ultra-Containment Wall?

1-ft high – approximately 10’
2-ft high – approximately 8’
3-ft high – approximately 6’

 
How is the liner held in place?The 30 MIL polyethylene textured liner is held on the walls with 8-foot long clips. These clips snap over the liner and the straight section walls (see image in gallery).
 
What size liner do I need?

1-ft wall - we recommend 5 feet extra on each side
2-ft wall - we recommend 10 feet extra on each side
3-ft wall - we recommend 15 feet extra on each side

Please note that our liners are made from rolls of material that are 12 feet wide.  So the liner that comes with your Ultra-Containment Wall system may be considerably larger than the overall footprint of the system.  Any excess material can easily be trimmed with a utility knife.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zoro, Inc has received 4.32 out of 5 stars based on 37 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Spill Containment

                        No matter what size or shape container you have, UltraTech probably has a spill containment product for it.
                    



Whether it's smaller items like 5-gallon buckets or an entire rail car, we've got a spill containment product to make sure that you are in compliance with the EPA and SPCC regulations. Spill pallets are available for one to four 55-gallon drums. If you need spill containment but want something that offers a lower profile, check out our Spill Decks. If you need spill containment for your drums but need safe outdoor storage as well, take a look in our Hard Top Spill Pallet section. For spill containment for larger containers, tanks and IBCs, we offer a complete line of IBC Spill Pallets.

Quality Management SystemUltratech, Inc. has a quality management system in place designed to consistently meet customer requirements in a cost-effective and timely manner, while continually improving our processes and procedures involved in the sheet metal fabrication process. Each job that enters our shop is treated with the same standard of inspection and care to ensure that it is made per print, and then delivered to the customer on time and in good condition.
At the beginning of the inspection process, each part is checked for compliance by our Amada Fabrivision optical inspection machine.  This ensures that the part was cut/punched from the sheet within tolerance and that all features of the part are present. As the part moves through the shop, a “First Piece Inspection” will be done for each additional operation to ensure compliance. Parts that require multiple welds, bends, or types of hardware will have each individually checked. Any machined parts that may be present in a project will be checked for compliance by our Optical Comparator machine. When a part reaches the end of the fabrication process it is put through a “Final Inspection” to double check tolerances, aesthetic requirements, and functionality.
If the customer insists on a more thorough inspection process we can provide a “First Article Inspection” or an AS 9100 type report, at a cost. In doing this we will provide reports of all dimensions, balloon drawings, paint certifications, plating certifications, material certifications, or whatever else may be required by the customer to receive the traceability they need on their product.
If for whatever reason a customer is not satisfied with the final product they have received, we are always willing to work with them to get it up to the standard they had expected.
EngineeringOur experienced engineering staff is happy to work closely with the customer to create the best product possible. Whether this means designing something from scratch, providing feedback for a potential prototype, re-engineering an existing product, or even something simple like selecting a material, we can help.Our goal is to provide the customer with the functionality they are looking for. With the latest engineering software available (Solidworks, Pro-E Wildifre 5.0), the possibilities are limitless. It does not matter if the product is the size of a quarter or a telephone booth, we can make it.
Files Formats Accepted: PDF, Pro-E, Solidworks, Inventor, IGES, STEP, DXF, DWG
