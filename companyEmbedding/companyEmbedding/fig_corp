Investing in Fig Food

Posted on March 25, 2015 by joel 


Investing in Fig Food offers a tangible step to meaningfully change your health, your environment and your future. Two stories running side-by-side in yesterday’s (3/24/15) Wall Street Journal crystallized that for me.
One story highlighted the link uncovered by the WHO between glyphosate (“Roundup”) and cancer, and Monsanto’s (the creator of Roundup) vociferous disagreement with the findings. As is too often the case, Monsanto sought to discredit the findings with hyperbole rather than substantive counter arguments.
Fig Food’s focus on North American, organic agriculture offers an alternative to glyphosate-driven agriculture. And we need your help. Organic planted acreage is declining in the United States due to the political clout of companies like Monsanto. You can make a difference by investing in Fig Food Co., companies committed to organic agricultural practices.
Adjacent to the glyphosate article was an article entitled “’Eat Right’ Meltdown for Kraft Singles”. The article noted the controversy about the use of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ “Kids Eat Right” logo on Kraft Singles. As Jon Stewart joked, “the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is an academy in the same way this is cheese,” pointing to a package of Kraft Singles.
I am not calling into question the seriousness of this academy. I am pointing out that our food system is under siege with misinformation. And one of the best ways to confront this siege is by investing in Fig Food. We seek not only to succeed with our line of plant-based, organic food, but also through educating and advocating for healthy eating and organic agriculture.
Please let me know of any thoughts or comments. I welcome the opportunity to continue this conversation.  Accredited investors, learn more at: circleup.com/c/fig-food.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

Posted on July 15, 2014August 27, 2014 by admin 


 
Because our health is at stake. We’re not being dramatic, the personal well being of each individual as well as that of the planet is at risk – and we’ve moved well past the point of debate. It is time to return to practicing a few things the way we did before the advent of processed food and industrialized agriculture.  We need to slow down and place far greater value on conscious eating rather than eating based on convenience and cost.
Real systemic change starts with each individual and our everyday choices. Perhaps the most fundamental of human activities, food requires decision-making which impacts our personal health and the environment. Food affects our economy and supply chain – but more than that, it shapes our values and approach to living life. We’ve entered an era where, for all the right reasons, consumers are asking the hard questions: how and where our food is grown; how it is prepared; whether or not anything has been added to it.
A more holistic mindset is emerging and changing how people approach food. This includes where people choose to invest their time and resources in quality, wholesome ingredients and food preparation. The organic lifestyle, slow cooking movement, efforts to lower our carbon footprint, and personal/private/governmental sustainability trends are redefining our culture and here to stay. 




Fig Food Co. Becomes B-Corporation Certified

Posted on July 10, 2014August 18, 2014 by admin 











WHY B-CORP MATTERS?
Certified B Corporations are leading a global movement to redefine success in business.

By voluntarily meeting higher standards of transparency, accountability, and performance, Certified B Corps are distinguishing themselves in a cluttered marketplace by offering a positive vision of a better way to do business.

We hope that you are inspired, not just by our vision, but by the movement’s ability to translate ideas into action.

B Corps create higher quality jobs and improve the quality of life in our communities. And, as the movement grows, it has become an increasingly powerful agent of change. We are passing laws. We are driving capital.

Government and the nonprofit sector are necessary but insufficient to address society’s greatest challenges. Business, the most powerful man-made force on the planet, must create value for society, not just shareholders. Systemic challenges require systemic solutions and the B Corp movement offers a concrete, market-based and scalable solution.

Over 1,000 businesses have already joined our community, encouraging all companies to compete not just to be the best in the world, but to be the best for the world. As a result of our collective success, individuals and communities will enjoy greater economic opportunity, society will address its most challenging environmental problems, and more people will find fulfillment by bringing their whole selves to work.

 
“What the corporation was to baby boomers the B Corp is to millennials: the place to work.”
– Salon

“B Corporations are a way to transcend the contradictions between the ineffective parts of the social sector and myopic capitalism.” – New York Times

“Think of it this way: USDA certifies organic foods, and Good Housekeeping puts its seal of approval on quality products, like washing machines and skillets. And since 2006, a nonprofit organization called B Lab has been certifying corporations it deems to be concerned about their communities and the environment.” – NPR

 
Statistics

 There are over 1,000 Certified B Corporations around the world.
There are Certified B Corps in over 30 countries.
B Corps were 65 percent more likely to survive the recession.

LogoProject Manager Interview Anonymous Interview Candidate in Charlotte, NCNo OfferNegative ExperienceAverage InterviewApplicationI applied through a staffing agency. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at FIG Corp. (Charlotte, NC) in January 2014.InterviewI got the interview via a staffing agency. There was suppose to be 3 people interviewing me, but one was sick. I spoke to the HR rep. and the team manager.They showed me the office sections and told me a little bit about what they do. Then the HR lady told me they are looking for "someone who can hop aboard and do things right away". That was strange because I was told by the staffers that there would be some training involved. Naturally, that's usually the case with everything. The actual interview was probably the briefest I've ever been through in my life. Needless to say, I left with a bad feeling about it. They asked me questions about my previous experience as a project coordinator, which I answered pretty directly.This situation felt like the textbook problem of HR and staffers not knowing about the actual job, employers expecting a 100% fit with no catchup leeway time in new hires, and staffing agencies not communicating the right information regarding arrangements and training.Interview Questions Your resume shows you worked as a (undisclosed A) and (undisclosed B) prior to you working as a project manager. What exactly are you trying to do with your life?   1 Answer Here at FIG, we care about a health work/life balance (says the HR lady).

About FIGS
Launched in 2012, FIGS is revolutionizing the old and stodgy medical apparel industry.  FIGS has given the medical “uniform” a huge face lift by using 100% ridiculously soft, performance fabrics that are tailored to perfection.
Through their Threads for Threads initiative, for every set of scrubs sold, FIGS gives a set to a healthcare provider in need.  They work with International Medical Corps and other healthcare organizations to execute on their mission.
At FIGS, we believe in making a positive impact on the world.  Giving back is engrained into our culture and is the reason we wake up to do the work that we do.  Nurses, doctors, and healthcare students throughout the developing world do not have access to the proper sanitary uniforms to do their jobs safely. Being a B Corporation allows us to account for the promises we make to our customers, our employees, the environment, and the medical community around the world.

The Change We Seek®
Inspire Good Taste.
FIGS provides the highest quality medical apparel directly to their customers.  Medical professionals are their most cherished resource and they believe they deserve the best.  That is why they design and manufacture every piece with the medical professional in mind – laser focused on fit, comfort, functionality and performance.
Access to Sanitary Uniforms.
Many medical professionals in impoverished areas are poorly compensated for their hard work and dedication.  They simply do not have enough money for costly medical uniforms.  FIGS is here to help and provide them with the proper sanitary uniforms to do their jobs safely.
Reduce Hospital-Acquired Infections.
Without the proper medical attire, the spreading of disease and illness increases exponentially.  Clean scrubs reduce the hospital-acquired infection rate by 66% and result in millions of dollars saved from unnecessary treatments. 
Promote Professionalism, Identity, and Pride.
The medical uniform gives healthcare providers a recognizable symbol of caring and commitment, promoting a strong sense of pride, professional identity and teamwork.
