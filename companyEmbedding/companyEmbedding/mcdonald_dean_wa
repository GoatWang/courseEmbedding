Important Note:
At McDonald's, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu items to our customers each and every time they visit our restaurants. We understand that each of our customers has individual needs and considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their home, especially those customers with food allergies. As part of our commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information available from our food suppliers for the eight most common allergens as identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (eggs, dairy, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish), so that our guests with food allergies can make informed food selections. However, we also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation areas, equipment and utensils, and the possibility exists for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including allergens. We encourage our customers with food allergies or special dietary needs to visit www.mcdonalds.com for ingredient information, and to consult their doctor for questions regarding their diet. Due to the individualized nature of food allergies and food sensitivities, customers' physicians may be best positioned to make recommendations for customers with food allergies and special dietary needs. If you have questions about our food, please reach out to us directly at mcdonalds.com/contact or 1- 800-244-6227.

The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing conducted in accredited laboratories, published resources, or from information provided from McDonald's suppliers. The nutrition information is based on standard product formulations and serving sizes (including ice for beverages). All nutrition information is based on average values for ingredients from McDonald's suppliers throughout the U.S. and is rounded to meet current U.S. FDA NLEA guidelines. Variation in serving sizes, preparation techniques, product testing and sources of supply, as well as regional and seasonal differences may affect the nutrition values for each product. In addition, product formulations change periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient content of the products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes may vary in your market. McDonald’s USA does not certify or claim any of its US menu items as Halal, Kosher or meeting any other religious requirements. We do not promote any of our US menu items as vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. The natural flavors that we use are derived from animal, plant, dairy or honey sources. Our fried menu items are cooked in a vegetable oil blend with citric acid added as a processing aid and dimethylpolysiloxane to reduce oil splatter when cooking. We are no longer adding TBHQ to our restaurant cooking oil, but as we transition to our new oil supply, some restaurants may have trace amounts of TBHQ in their cooking oil for a period of time. This information is correct as of February 2017, unless stated otherwise.

              Burgers
            











                  Yes, every patty is 100% real beef with no fillers, additives or preservatives. Have more questions? They’re probably answered here.
                

                  What kind of beef do you use in your burgers?
                

                  Every one of our burgers is made with 100% ground beef. Nothing else is added. No fillers, extenders or preservatives. We use the trimmings of cuts like the chuck, round, and sirloin for our burgers, which are ground and formed into our hamburger patties. Check out more information about our beef.
                  



                  How do you make your beef patties?
                

                  Our burgers are made of 100% ground beef, formed into hamburger patties and then quickly frozen at our suppliers to provide you the freshest flavor. We add salt and pepper to our burgers when they are cooked on the grill at our restaurant to bring out all that great beef taste. Learn more about the beef we use.
                  



                  How do you season your beef?
                

                  We add salt and pepper to our burgers when they are cooked on the grill at our restaurant to bring out all that great beef taste. We don’t add anything when making our patties – they are 100% ground beef.
                  

                  Of course, there’s always an option to order without salt and pepper, so you can adjust your order to fit any dietary needs. (Or, just your preferred taste.) Learn more about how we make our beef patties.
                  



                  What is in the Big Mac sauce?
                

                  Ah, the age-old question of what's in our "secret sauce." But what good is a secret sauce if you can’t keep it secret? Only kidding. Find a full list of ingredients here.
                  



                  Where do you get your beef?
                

                  It takes a lot of beef to make as many famous burgers as we do — so our suppliers buy from ranchers located throughout the U.S. including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.
                  

                  While we remain one of the largest purchasers of U.S. beef, we also import USDA-inspected beef from New Zealand, Australia and recently Canada. Beef up your knowledge.




                  Do you sell veggie burgers?
                

                  No, we don’t currently sell veggie burgers. Although, we are always looking to evolve our menu. We have many customizable menu items like our Salads that we’re happy to make for you without meat; although, these aren’t certified vegetarian. Find out more about how you can tailor your orders with our menu explorer.
                  



                  Is your beef ‘grass-fed’?
                

                  Farming practices vary, but most of the cattle we use for our beef are raised in the U.S. on grass for the first part of their lives. Later, the cattle are provided a balanced diet of grains, grasses and minerals. Get more information about our beef.
                  



                  Can I order a sandwich without sauce?
                

                  Go for it! We want you to be happy with your meal, so we encourage you to customize your order to your tastes. Lighter on our special sauce? You got it. More pickles? Done. The possibilities are endless. Check out our menu explorer and see how you can customize your sandwich.
                  



                  Are your burgers fresh or frozen?
                

                  Our 100% beef is ground, formed into patties and then flash frozen. Flash freezing is when beef is ground fresh and then quickly frozen to seal in fresh flavor. From there, it usually takes about two to three weeks until the burger is served from the day it was formed. Care to learn more about how we make our beef patties? We’ve got you covered.




                  Why do you offer cheaper menu items than some other restaurants?
                

                  We serve more than 27 million customers every day, so we buy in bulk. And, as anyone who’s ever shopped at a warehouse club can attest to, that means lower prices. Those savings are then passed along you to you.
                  



                  How is your McRib patty formed?
                

                  We start with pork that’s ground from the pork shoulder. The actual patty is then formed with a special press you’d use to shape a hamburger patty, except this one resembles the shape of a rack of ribs. Why a rack of ribs? Easy…it’s fun. And it’s one of the reasons the McRib has developed such a loyal following. Get the full list of ingredients on our McRib page.




                  How do you make your McRib sandwich?
                

                  The McRib starts with pork ground from the pork shoulder that has been shaped into that iconic, rack of ribs shape. The patty gets tossed with a tangy barbecue sauce and then topped with slivered onions and pickles. And it’s all layered on a soft, hoagie-style roll. Makes you wish you had one right now, doesn’t it? Still curious about what's in a McRib?
                  



                  Why isn't the McRib sold year-round?
                

                  We like to change up our menu throughout the year by offering some limited time only items, like our Shamrock Shake in the Spring. The timing of the McRib’s return can vary from year to year, but most recently, it’s made its appearance in the Fall. If you'd like to share your thoughts with us, find us on Facebook or Twitter. We're always here to listen.
                  



                  Is the McRib fresh or frozen?
                

                  The McRib pork patty is quickly frozen right after being formed to maintain the great taste. It is then fully cooked in our stores and assembled with slivered onions, pickles and barbecue sauce on a hoagie-style roll.
                  



                  Is your McRib made from real pork? What cuts do you use?
                

                  We use ground pork from the pork shoulder to form the McRib patty into that famous, rack of ribs shape. Still curious about what's in a McRib?
                  



                  Do you use so-called 'pink slime' in your burgers or beef treated with ammonia?
                

                  Nope. Our beef patties are made from 100% pure beef. Nothing else is added. No fillers, extenders or so-called “pink-slime.”
                  

                  Some consumers may be familiar with the practice of using lean finely textured beef sometimes treated with ammonia, which is referred to by some as “pink slime.” We do not use this. Still curious about what's in our burgers?
                  





                  Tender and juicy chicken? Yep. Is our Filet-O-Fish® sustainably-sourced? You know it. Read more in this section.
                

                  What's in a Chicken McNugget?
                

                  Our McNuggets start with all white meat chicken. The chicken, which is cut from the tenderloin, breast and rib, gets mixed with a marinade for flavor and to help each McNugget keep its fun shape.
                  

                  Still curious about our Chicken McNugget's?
                  



                  What kind of chicken do you use in a chicken sandwich?
                

                  Our Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse Sandwich are made with chicken breast filets, which are seasoned with simple, everyday ingredients and the chicken filet contains no artificial preservatives. Seared right in our kitchens.
                  

                  Our Buttermilk Crispy chicken is made with real buttermilk in the breading, blended with spices including black pepper, garlic & onion powder.
                  

                  Our Premium Crispy Chicken Bacon Clubhouse Sandwich is made of a tender and juicy chicken breast filet.
                  

                  In our McChicken sandwiches, we use a filet that's made with a blend of dark and white meat chicken, so it's juicy and flavorful. Learn more here.




                  Does your chicken contain added hormones?
                

                  No, we don’t add hormones to our chicken. As a matter of fact, no one in the U.S. does – it’s actually against federal law.
                  



                  How do you prepare your Chicken McNuggets?
                

                  We start with all white-meat chicken cut from the tenderloin, breast and rib and mix it with a maranade for flavor and juiciness and to help them keep their fun shape.
                  

                  Once everything is mixed, we create the four famous Chicken McNugget shapes – bell, boot, ball and bone. They’re coated in a light tempura batter, partially fried and quickly frozen to preserve flavor. Once in our restaurants, they’re fully fried and served hot to you with a delicious taste that is full of flavor. Still curious about the ingredients in a Chicken McNugget?




                  Where do you get your Chicken McNuggets?
                

                  We work with three dedicated Chicken McNugget suppliers: Keystone Foods, Tyson and Dorada — all located in the U.S., in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.
                  



                  Do you use so-called "pink slime" or "pink goop" in your Chicken McNuggets?
                

                  No, our Chicken McNuggets do not contain what some people call "pink slime" or "pink goop." We've seen the photo of "pink goop" or "pink slime" in association with McDonald's.
                  

                  Let's set the record straight: this image in connection with McDonald's is a myth. In fact, we don't know where it came from, but it's not our food. The photo is not a representation of how we create our Chicken McNuggets, or for that matter, any item on our menu. Each and every one of our Chicken McNuggets are made with USDA inspected boneless white meat chicken — cut from the chicken breast, tenderloins and rib meat.Still curious about what's in a Chicken McNugget?

                  Do you only use chicken treated without antibiotics?
                

                  In 2015, we introduced a new antibiotics policy in the U.S. to only source chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine. Farmers who supply chicken for our menu will continue to responsibly use ionophores, a type of antibiotic not used for humans, that helps keep chickens healthy.
                  

                  U.S. farms are working closely with McDonald’s suppliers to implement the new antibiotics policy to the supply chain by 2017.
                  

                  We have also committed to fully transitioning to cage-free eggs in the U.S. and Canada by 2025. Learn more here.
                  



                  What type of fish do you use in the Filet-O-Fish?
                




                  We use wild-caught Alaska Pollock for our Filet-O-Fish sandwich in the U.S., which is 100% sourced from sustainable fisheries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council. Why is sustainable fish so important to us? Because it helps protect our oceans – something that's important to you. Interested in learning more about the Filet-O-Fish?
                  



                  Why is there only half a slice of cheese on the Filet-O-Fish?
                

                  We go by the same recipe one of our franchisees came up with way back when in 1961. Who knew, right? Of course, you can always ask for 'extra' cheese the next time you order a tasty Filet-O-Fish at your local McDonald's. It’s the 21st Century, after all.

                  Do you use freshly cracked eggs?
                

                  We use a freshly cracked, Grade A egg for our famous Egg McMuffin sandwich. It gets its iconic round shape when we cook it on the grill with an ‘egg ring.’ And that’s just the start of your favorite morning sandwich! Next we add extra lean Canadian bacon, a slice of melted American cheese, and serve it all on a toasted English muffin with real butter.

                  Good question. Our breakfast menu items are all made with real eggs – they’re just prepared a little differently for each sandwich.
                  

Round Egg:

                  We use a USDA Grade A cracked into an ‘egg ring’ to get that iconic round shape for our Egg McMuffin.
                  

Scrambled Eggs:

                  Our scrambled eggs are made with liquid eggs that are cooked fresh on our grill with real butter.
                  

Egg Whites:

                  We use 100% egg whites in our Egg White Delight McMuffin, cooking them on our grill with real butter.
                  

Folded Eggs:

                  Our folded eggs, like the ones on a Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit, are made with liquid eggs that are pre-cooked and folded before being flash frozen by our suppliers. Once in our kitchens, they’re prepared on the grill with real butter.
                  

Sausage Burrito Eggs:

                  Our suppliers pre-cook liquid eggs with ingredients that include sausage, tomatoes, green chiles, onions and seasonings before flash freezing them to help maintain their taste.

                  How do you make the egg on the Egg McMuffin round?
                

                  With an ingenious tool we call an ‘egg ring.’ That way, the egg effortlessly fits the English muffin and is easy to hold when eating. That Grade A egg is served with extra lean Canadian bacon and a slice of melted American cheese, served on a toasted English muffin with real butter. Cool, huh?

                  Do you currently use cage-free eggs?
                

                  By 2025 McDonald's will source cage-free eggs for our restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. This commitment means all of the eggs we serve on our breakfast menu — from scrambled eggs to our iconic Egg McMuffin — will be sourced from hens raised in a cage-free aviary system, which is a hen housing system where the hens roam freely through an open barn or section within the barn.
                  

                  We’re proud to share that our transition to cage-free eggs has already begun with more than 12 million cage-free eggs purchased each year in the U.S. in 2015. Because we source approximately 2 billion eggs in the U.S. today, this move is a bold step forward in our continuing journey to evolve our food experience to better meet consumers changing expectations.
                  



                  Are your eggs microwaved or grilled before serving?
                

                  Well, it depends on which egg you’re referring to. Our freshly cracked and scrambled eggs, as well as egg whites are cooked on the grill with liquid real butter. We also use the grill to heat our folded egg, which is previously cooked in our suppliers’ kitchens before arriving at our restaurants. As for the eggs used in our Sausage Burrito, we cook these in our suppliers’ kitchens then microwave in our restaurants prior to serving. Get the details on how we prepare our breakfast eggs for you.

                  Where do you get your lettuce?
                

                 
                  The majority of our lettuce comes from farms right here in the U.S. We move our sourcing through out the year based on the seasons. From April to November it's primarily from California and Colorado, and in the winter months, from Arizona and Florida. We also supplement it with a small amount imported from Mexico.

                  Do you use real potatoes for your fries?
                

                  Yep. The most common ones we use include the Russet Burbank, Russet Ranger, Umatilla Russet and the Shepody – varieties known for producing a flavorful fry that's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Learn more about how we make our fries.
                  



                  How do you make your fries?
                

                  The potatoes we used for our World Famous Fries are made from premium potatoes – including Russet Burbank, Ranger Russet, Umatilla Russet and the Shepody. The suppliers we work with first peel, cut and blanche the potatoes. They then dry, partially fry and quickly freeze the fries for our restaurants. Once in our kitchens, we cook them in our canola blend oil so you can have them crispy and hot – just the way you like them. Want to hear more about our fry ingredients? Get the down low.




                  Do you add any type of flavor when preparing your fries?
                

                  Yes. When our suppliers partially fry our cut potatoes, they use an oil blend that contains beef flavoring. This ensures the great-tasting and recognizable flavor we all love about our World Famous Fries. The fries are finally seasoned with salt after they're cooked in our kitchens and served hot to you. Still curious? Find out everything you need to know about our fries.
                  



                  Why are your fries so good?
                

                  If we had a dime for every time someone asked us that! We stick to a gold standard that helps us ensure we deliver you a great tasting fry. It starts with the right potatoes, which we cut exactly right, and then use a canola blend oil with just the right amount of salt after cooking. Get the full run down on how we make our World Famous Fries.
                  



                  How much salt do you add to your fries?
                

                  We add a small amount of salt to our fries after we've cooked them in our kitchen. Find all the information you're looking about sodium per serving for our fries on their nutrition page.
                  



                  What are the ingredients in your fries?
                

                  Considering the popularity of our World Famous Fries, there's a lot of care that goes into perfecting them.
                  

                  It should come as no surprise the primary ingredient for our World Famous Fries is a great tasting potato, including a variety of Shepody, Ranger Russet, Umatilla Russet and Russet Burbank. For their signature golden look, we add dextrose — a natural form of sugar that helps give the fries their perfect golden color. Sodium acid pyrophosphate is also added to keep the potatoes from turning gray after freezing and before they are cooked at the restaurant. This is a natural occurrence in potatoes, similar to how an apple might turn brown after being cut. In order to maintain texture, our suppliers partially fry our fries in an oil blend containing canola, soybean and hydrogenated soybean oil. Our suppliers add natural beef flavor, which includes hydrolyzed wheat and hydrolyzed milk, to the par fry oil to contribute to that World Famous Fry taste. Citric acid is also added to preserve the freshness of the oil, as well as dimethylpolysiloxane to reduce foaming and oil splattering.
                  

                  In our restaurants, we finish frying with an oil blend that contains canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil, as well as citric acid, dimethylpolysiloxane and TBHQ. TBHQ is an antioxidant that also acts as a preservative, allowing the oil to remain fresh from the supplier all the way to the restaurant.
                  

                  Right after cooking, our crew adds salt before serving hot to you. We’re really proud of our fries. That's why we make sure they’re top notch before serving to you. Check out more facts on our World Famous Fries.

                  Do any of the McDonald’s stores sell curly fries?

                  Where do you get your produce?
                

                  It comes from all over, really. A menu like ours is diverse and so is how we source our produce. Our apples come from Washington, Michigan, New York, California, Virginia and Pennsylvania. During the summer months, we import apples from Chile. Once in a while we get some from Canada, too. We get our jalapeños from Mexico. When it comes to onions we go to the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon), California, Texas and sometimes Mexico.
                  

                  We find most of the leafy greens for our salads right here in the U.S., but some come from Mexico, too. Our fresh tomatoes originate in Florida, the Carolinas, California and Mexico. 100% greenhouse grown, our cucumbers hail from Canada. See all of the nutritional info about our salads.

                  What is in the Big Mac sauce?
                

                  Ah, the age-old question of what's in our "secret sauce." But what good is a secret sauce if you can’t keep it secret? Only kidding. Find a full list of ingredients here.
                  



                  Why are your ingredients for your fries different in the U.S. from those in the U.K.?
                

                  Every country has a way of doing things a little differently, so there are a few reasons that can influence why our ingredients vary here at home. These can include customer preferences, local regulations and guidelines, and supply chain availability. While the ingredients we use in our fries may differ here in the U.S. from those served across the pond, taste and safety are never compromised.

                  Smoothies, coffee, espresso. We’ve got all of the buzz on our McCafé drinks here.
                

                  Can I get a decaf McCafé espresso drink?

                  Is your coffee responsibly grown?
                

                  As of 2014, about 32% of our total global coffee bean purchases were from Rainforest Alliance Certified™, Fair Trade USA or UTZ Certified farms. The majority of our certified coffee purchases are from Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms, including 100% of our espresso in the U.S. and Canada. This is moving us toward our goal of 100% verified sustainable coffee, both hot and iced, by 2020.
                  

                  Here in the U.S., in partnership with our franchisees along with McDonald’s Canada, we’re investing $6.5 million in a technical assistance program for our coffee farmers in Central America. Over the four and a half year program, we’re helping more than 15,000 coffee farmers produce more sustainably.
                  

                  Farmers in our program are seeing amazing results. Their net income from coffee has increased by 38% and their coffee harvests are 51% greater than their neighbors. The increase in coffee yields is especially impressive given the heavy presence of roya, a widespread coffee disease that has had grave effects on harvests in the region. These sustainable farming practices have led to more resilient coffee plants, better income for coffee farmers, and a greater supply of high quality coffee for you, our customers.

                  Why does the Coca-Cola taste so good at McDonald’s?
                

                  There are many reasons the Coca-Cola tastes so great at McDonald’s. We simply follow the guidelines set by Coca-Cola and take steps to ensure it tastes the same as when you buy it in a bottle.
                  

                  The water and Coca-Cola syrup are pre-chilled before entering our fountain dispensers with the ratio of syrup set to allow for ice to melt. We also keep our fountain beverage system cold so your drink can always be at the peak of refreshing. In order to ensure our drinks are always meeting a gold standard, we have proper filtration methods in place.
                  

                  There’s also our straw – it’s slightly wider than a typical straw, so all that Coke taste can hit all your tastebuds.

                  Where does your milk in your milk jugs come from?
                

                  It comes from a cow, of course. Dairies around the U.S. including Dean Foods, Kemp’s Darigold and Crystal Creamery supply 100% of the milk for our Milk Jugs.
                  



                  Do you use milk from cows treated without rbST?

While no significant difference has been shown between milk delivered from rbST treated and non-rbST treated cows, it’s something we know our customers want.

                  It should come as no surprise the primary ingredient for our World Famous Fries is a great tasting potato, including a variety of Shepody, Ranger Russet, Umatilla Russet and Russet Burbank. For their signature golden look, we add dextrose — a natural form of sugar that helps give the fries their perfect golden color. Sodium acid pyrophosphate is also added to keep the potatoes from turning gray after freezing and before they are cooked at the restaurant. This is a natural occurrence in potatoes, similar to how an apple might turn brown after being cut. In order to maintain texture, our suppliers partially fry our fries in an oil blend containing canola, soybean and hydrogenated soybean oil. Our suppliers add natural beef flavor, which includes hydrolyzed wheat and hydrolyzed milk, to the par fry oil to contribute to that World Famous Fry taste. Citric acid is also added to preserve the freshness of the oil, as well as dimethylpolysiloxane to reduce foaming and oil splattering.
                  

                  In our restaurants, we finish frying with an oil blend that contains canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil, as well as citric acid, dimethylpolysiloxane and TBHQ. TBHQ is an antioxidant that also acts as a preservative, allowing the oil to remain fresh from the supplier all the way to the restaurant.
                  

                  Right after cooking, our crew adds salt before serving hot to you. We’re really proud of our fries. That's why we make sure they’re top notch before serving to you. Check out more facts on our World Famous Fries.




                  What’s in a McGriddles bun?
                

                  Actually, it’s not really a bun – it’s a warm griddle cake that has the taste of maple baked right in. Learn more about the McGriddles and get complete ingredient info.




                  Where does your milk in your milk jugs come from?
                

                  It comes from a cow, of course. Dairies around the U.S. including Dean Foods, Kemp’s Darigold and Crystal Creamery supply 100% of the milk for our Milk Jugs.
                  



                  Do you use real apples in your apple pies?
                

                  
                  Absolutely — real diced apples. The exact variety can vary from season to season, but we look for apples that are sweet and slightly tart. See a full ingredient list for our Apple Pies.




                  What is your soft serve ice cream made of?
                

                  You'll find ingredients like milk, sugar and cream in our reduced fat vanilla ice cream. Still curious? Learn more about our reduced fat vanilla ice cream.
                  



                  What kind of oil do you cook with?
                

                  We use a canola blend cooking oil when preparing our fried menu items including — French Fries, Hash Browns, Chicken McNuggets, the Filet-O-Fish and crispy chicken sandwiches.
                  



                  Why doesn’t your food rot?
                

                  Actually, it can. Food needs moisture in the air for mold to form. Without it, food will simply dry out – sort of like bread left out on a counter overnight to make croutons for stuffing.
                  

                  You might have seen experiments which seem to show no decomposition in our food. Most likely, this is because the food has dehydrated before any visible deterioration could occur.
                  



                  How do you make your McRib sandwich?
                

                  The McRib starts with pork ground from the pork shoulder that has been shaped into that iconic, rack of ribs shape. The patty gets tossed with a tangy barbecue sauce and then topped with slivered onions and pickles. And it’s all layered on a soft, hoagie-style roll. Makes you wish you had one right now, doesn’t it? Still curious about what's in a McRib?

                  Currently, we don't offer a gluten-free menu.
                  

                  That said, we encourage our customers with special dietary needs to visit our Menu Explorer for full lists of ingredients. Because food sensitivities are so different from person to person, we would recommend you follow up with your physician to make your best health decision.
                  

                  We also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation equipment, areas and utensils, and the possibility for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including other allergens.
                  



                  Do you sell veggie burgers?
                

                  No, we don’t currently sell veggie burgers. Although, we are always looking to evolve our menu.

We’re committed to helping make nutrition-minded choices fun and easy for families and we’re proud to have increased access to key food groups like delicious fresh fruit and dairy.

                  How are you changing the way you think about ingredients?
                

                  We want our customers to feel good about the food they eat in our restaurants, which is why we’re making changes they will feel good about and taking a different approach to ingredients. We recognize our customers’ expectations have evolved and we’re evolving with them.
                  

                  In recent months we’ve made a number of changes to our menu items, which has included the removal of some ingredients, including the additive azodicarbonamide in our sandwich buns. In addition, we’ve also introduced a number of new menu items that highlight simple, everyday ingredients like our Artisan Grilled Chicken patty or our buttermilk Crispy Chicken, which uses real buttermilk in the breading.
                  

                  This continuation of the journey we began last year when we announced a number of other changes to our menu and how we source our food. These announcements included commitments to source chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine by 2017, only sourcing cage-free eggs for our breakfast menu items in the U.S. and Canada by 2025 and only offering milk jugs of low-fat white and fat-free chocolate milk from cows that have not been treated with rbST, an artificial growth hormone.
                  



                  Do you use real butter?
                

                  Yes! Just like how you butter toast at home, we use real butter on our English muffins, biscuits and bagels on breakfast menu items, making mornings extra special.
                  



                  Why are you partners with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation?
                

                  In 2013, we partnered with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation on a Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Commitment to make five commitments to increase access to fruits and vegetables and help families make more informed choices. This also supports our global food commitment to increase the amount of fruit, vegetable, low fat dairy and whole grains we serve by 2020.
                  

                  This partnership is just one way we’re making changes to help parents feel better about McDonald’s. An annual report from Keybridge, an independent firm, demonstrates our progress. See how we’re doing here.

                  Where do you get your beef?
                

                  It takes a lot of beef to make as many famous burgers as we do — so our suppliers buy from ranchers located throughout the U.S. including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.
                  

                  While we remain one of the largest purchasers of U.S. beef, we also import USDA-inspected beef from New Zealand, Australia and recently Canada. Beef up your knowledge.




                  Is your coffee responsibly grown?
                

                  As of 2014, about 32% of our total global coffee bean purchases were from Rainforest Alliance Certified™, Fair Trade USA or UTZ Certified farms. The majority of our certified coffee purchases are from Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms, including 100% of our espresso in the U.S. and Canada. This is moving us toward our goal of 100% verified sustainable coffee, both hot and iced, by 2020.
                  

                  Here in the U.S., in partnership with our franchisees along with McDonald’s Canada, we’re investing $6.5 million in a technical assistance program for our coffee farmers in Central America. Over the four and a half year program, we’re helping more than 15,000 coffee farmers produce more sustainably.
                  

                  Farmers in our program are seeing amazing results. Their net income from coffee has increased by 38% and their coffee harvests are 51% greater than their neighbors. The increase in coffee yields is especially impressive given the heavy presence of roya, a widespread coffee disease that has had grave effects on harvests in the region. These sustainable farming practices have led to more resilient coffee plants, better income for coffee farmers, and a greater supply of high quality coffee for you, our customers.
                  



                  Do you recycle at every McDonald’s location?
                

                  Recycling is just as important to us as it is to you so, in some areas, our restaurants offer recycling and/or composting. Find out more about how we’re trying to prevent food waste.
                

                  Where do you get your produce?
                

                  It comes from all over, really. A menu like ours is diverse and so is how we source our produce. Our apples come from Washington, Michigan, New York, California, Virginia and Pennsylvania. During the summer months, we import apples from Chile. Once in a while we get some from Canada, too. We get our jalapeños from Mexico. When it comes to onions we go to the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon), California, Texas and sometimes Mexico.
                  

                  We find most of the leafy greens for our salads right here in the U.S., but some come from Mexico, too. Our fresh tomatoes originate in Florida, the Carolinas, California and Mexico. 100% greenhouse grown, our cucumbers hail from Canada. See all of the nutritional info about our salads.
                  



                  Where do you get your lettuce?
                

                 
                  The majority of our lettuce comes from farms right here in the U.S. We move our sourcing through out the year based on the seasons. From April to November it's primarily from California and Colorado, and in the winter months, from Arizona and Florida. We also supplement it with a small amount imported from Mexico.
                  

                  Curious to know what kind of lettuce we use for our salads?
                  



                  Where do you get your apples?
                

                
                  Our apples are grown throughout the U.S. We get them from Washington, Michigan, New York, California, Virginia and Pennsylvania. During the summer months we import apples from Chile, and once in awhile we get some from Canada too.
                  



                  Are your eggs real?
                

                  Oh, they’re real alright. Across all five styles of eggs we make, you can feel confident knowing they all start with a real egg.
                  

Learn more about the different ways we prepare our eggs, from our egg whites to our iconic round egg.
                  



                  Do you currently use cage-free eggs?
                

                  By 2025 McDonald's will source cage-free eggs for our restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. This commitment means all of the eggs we serve on our breakfast menu — from scrambled eggs to our iconic Egg McMuffin — will be sourced from hens raised in a cage-free aviary system, which is a hen housing system where the hens roam freely through an open barn or section within the barn.
                  

                  We’re proud to share that our transition to cage-free eggs has already begun with more than 12 million cage-free eggs purchased each year in the U.S. in 2015. Because we source approximately 2 billion eggs in the U.S. today, this move is a bold step forward in our continuing journey to evolve our food experience to better meet consumers changing expectations.
                  



                  Where do you get your Chicken McNuggets?
                

                  We work with three dedicated Chicken McNugget suppliers: Keystone Foods, Tyson and Dorada — all located in the U.S., in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.
                  



                  How do you care for the animals within your supply chain?
                

                  We take the humane treatment of animals very seriously. We’re committed to continuously working with our suppliers to ensure their animals are properly cared for throughout their lives.
                  

                  In fact, animal welfare is something we’ve been passionate about for a while now. In the mid 1990s, we established our relationship with animal expert, Dr. Temple Grandin and formed our first animal welfare council with experts in chicken, beef, pork and eggs. From there, we worked with Dr. Grandin to have approved slaughter facilities undergo third party animal health and welfare inspections on a yearly basis.
                  

                  In 2000, we acted as a leader in the industry, specifically in regards to eggs, when we established our laying hen animal welfare program for cage systems. What does that mean? Well, we worked to make sure the hens our suppliers worked with were properly cared for by increasing the space around them and ensuring there wasn’t any forced molting. We also monitored that area to make sure all waste was disposed of properly.
                  

                  Today, we continue to focus our efforts on subjects like hen housing through our support of enriched and cage-free options that measures impacts on animal welfare, food safety, worker/employee welfare and the environment. In addition we are committed to working with our pork suppliers to phase out the practice of housing pregnant sows in gestation stalls by the end of 2022. Find out more information about our global efforts on animal welfare.
                  



                  Do you only use chicken treated without antibiotics?
                

                  In 2015, we introduced a new antibiotics policy in the U.S. to only source chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine. Farmers who supply chicken for our menu will continue to responsibly use ionophores, a type of antibiotic not used for humans, that helps keep chickens healthy.
                  

                  U.S. farms are working closely with McDonald’s suppliers to implement the new antibiotics policy to the supply chain by 2017.
                  

                  We have also committed to fully transitioning to cage-free eggs in the U.S. and Canada by 2025. Learn more here.
                  



                  What type of fish do you use in the Filet-O-Fish?
                




                  We use wild-caught Alaska Pollock for our Filet-O-Fish sandwich in the U.S., which is 100% sourced from sustainable fisheries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council. Why is sustainable fish so important to us? Because it helps protect our oceans – something that's important to you. Interested in learning more about the Filet-O-Fish?
                  



                  Where does your milk in your milk jugs come from?
                

                  It comes from a cow, of course. Dairies around the U.S. including Dean Foods, Kemp’s Darigold and Crystal Creamery supply 100% of the milk for our Milk Jugs.
                  



                  Is your beef ‘grass-fed’?
                

                  Farming practices vary, but most of the cattle we use for our beef are raised in the U.S. on grass for the first part of their lives. Later, the cattle are provided a balanced diet of grains, grasses and minerals. Get more information about our beef.
                  



                  Do you use milk from cows treated without rbST?
                

                  We offer customers milk jugs of low-fat white milk and fat-free chocolate milk from cows that are not treated with rbST, an artificial growth hormone. While no significant difference has been shown between milk delivered from rbST treated and non-rbST treated cows, it’s something we know our customers want.
                  





                  We want our menu to be food you can feel good about feeding your family. This is where we’ve got answers to frequently asked questions about items on our menu.
                

                  Is breakfast served all day?

                  Why? Because of you! You told us you wanted to live in a world where the 10:30AM cutoff didn’t exist, a world you could have breakfast anytime you wanted. Well, we heard you. Made just for you, the All Day Breakfast Menu is filled with fan favorites from our original breakfast menu.

                  Why did my favorite menu item disappear?
                

                  We get it – it can be a bummer to see your favorite menu item suddenly disappear. We switch up our menu items based on what we hear from you. This way, our menu evolves and you always have something new to look forward to. Check out all of your options within our Menu Explorer.
                  



                  Is there a secret menu?
                

                  We have no secret menu — or do we? Actually, our customers are pretty clever when it comes to customizing their orders with our menu items, so you may have seen some of their creations online. But we have no official secret menu of our own. Visit our menu explorer to make to most of your meal.
                  



                  Can I order a sandwich without sauce?
                

                  Go for it! We want you to be happy with your meal, so we encourage you to customize your order to your tastes. Lighter on our special sauce? You got it. More pickles? Done. The possibilities are endless. Check out our menu explorer and see how you can customize your sandwich.
                  



                  Why do you offer cheaper menu items than some other restaurants?
                

                  We serve more than 27 million customers every day, so we buy in bulk. And, as anyone who’s ever shopped at a warehouse club can attest to, that means lower prices. Those savings are then passed along you to you.
                  



                  What do you do with left over food at the end of the day?
                

                  On the whole, we try to avoid having leftover food at the end of the workday. And we currently recycle used cooking oil in nearly all of our restaurants. We’re constantly working to improve food donation efforts, coffee ground recycling and piloting other composting programs to reduce food waste. We’re as committed to the environment as you.
                

                  Why are your ingredients for your fries different in the U.S. from those in the U.K.?
                

                  Every country has a way of doing things a little differently, so there are a few reasons that can influence why our ingredients vary here at home. These can include customer preferences, local regulations and guidelines, and supply chain availability. While the ingredients we use in our fries may differ here in the U.S. from those served across the pond, taste and safety are never compromised.
                  



                  Where do you get your Chicken McNuggets?
                

                  We work with three dedicated Chicken McNugget suppliers: Keystone Foods, Tyson and Dorada — all located in the U.S., in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.
                  



                  How would you recommend reheating your fries once they're cold?
                

                  Our World Famous Fries are best enjoyed when they’re served fresh and hot. For that reason, we don't recommend any specific reheating method.
                  

                  Still curious about our fries? We've got the down low.
                  



                  Where do you get your produce?
                

                  It comes from all over, really. A menu like ours is diverse and so is how we source our produce. Our apples come from Washington, Michigan, New York, California, Virginia and Pennsylvania. During the summer months, we import apples from Chile. Once in a while we get some from Canada, too. We get our jalapeños from Mexico. When it comes to onions we go to the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon), California, Texas and sometimes Mexico.
                  

                  We find most of the leafy greens for our salads right here in the U.S., but some come from Mexico, too. Our fresh tomatoes originate in Florida, the Carolinas, California and Mexico. 100% greenhouse grown, our cucumbers hail from Canada. See all of the nutritional info about our salads.
                  



                  What's a 10:35? Is there really such a thing as a secret menu?
                

                  The 10:35 is not an official part of our menu. We know our customers are pretty creative people and like to customize our menu items, but we do not have a secret menu.
                  



                  What's the difference between hotcakes and pancakes?
                

                  There is no difference. We just prefer to call them ‘hotcakes’ instead of ‘pancakes.’ Still round, fluffy and topped with real butter. Simple as that.
                  

                  Still curious? Learn more about our hotcakes.
                  



                  How healthy is your breakfast parfait?
                

                  Well, why don’t we just give you the facts: our Fruit ‘N Yogurt parfait is made from low-fat yogurt, berries and granola, all for 150 calories. You decide if it’s for you. See a full list of nutrition information.




                  Do you recycle at every McDonald’s location?
                

                  Recycling is just as important to us as it is to you so, in some areas, our restaurants offer recycling and/or composting. Find out more about how we’re trying to prevent food waste.
                

                  Are there vegetarian options on your menu?
                

                  Many of our menu items can be customized without meat. We encourage you to order however you like – if that means without meat, we’ll gladly prepare that for you. However, we don’t offer any certified vegetarian options at this time. Check out all of your options within the Menu Explorer.
                  



                  Do any of your menu items contain high fructose corn syrup?
                

                  Yes, some do. We use a variety of sweeteners including high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), in our menu items based on how they contribute to taste and texture as do our suppliers. In fact, HFCS is a commonly used sweetener in a wide variety of products found on your local supermarket shelves.
                  

                  We realize that HFCS has received a lot of attention in recent years. HFCS is made from corn and is similar in composition to table sugar. So, just like any other sweetener, it can be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.
                  

                  Check out our menu explorer for more information about our ingredients.
                  



                  What is the healthiest meal I can get at McDonald's?
                

                  Our menu offers a variety of options, and we make it easy for you to get nutritional information so you can pick and choose the meal that best meets your needs. We’re also evolving to meet your changing tastes. Based on what you’ve told us, we’ve added options, like our Egg White Delight McMuffin, Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and Premium Salads. Just a few examples of some balanced choices for you. See a full list within our Nutrition Calculator.
                  



                  Do you even sell real food?
                

                  Absolutely.
                  

                  From the 100% beef in our burgers to the white meat chicken in our Chicken McNuggets to the Grade A egg in our Egg McMuffin, we serve you food that's not only delicious but very real.
                  

                  Check out more of our real food in our menu explorer.
                  



                  Do you offer any kind of gluten-free alternative?
                

                  Currently, we don't offer a gluten-free menu.
                  

                  That said, we encourage our customers with special dietary needs to visit our Menu Explorer for full lists of ingredients. Because food sensitivities are so different from person to person, we would recommend you follow up with your physician to make your best health decision.
                  

                  We also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation equipment, areas and utensils, and the possibility for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including other allergens.
                  



                  Do you sell veggie burgers?
                

                  No, we don’t currently sell veggie burgers. Although, we are always looking to evolve our menu. We have many customizable menu items like our Salads that we’re happy to make for you without meat; although, these aren’t certified vegetarian. Find out more about how you can tailor your orders with our menu explorer.
                  



                  Are your meat products gluten-free?
                

                  Currently, we don't offer a gluten-free menu.
                  

                  That said, we encourage our customers with special dietary needs to visit our Menu Explorer for full lists of ingredients. Because food sensitivities are so different from person to person, we would recommend you follow up with your physician to make your best health decision.
                  

                  We also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation equipment, areas and utensils, and the possibility for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including other allergens.
                  



                  Would you feed your food to your own family?
                

                  Absolutely. We genuinely enjoy the food we make and are proud to have our families eat it too.
                  



                  How much do you care about the people who eat your food?
                

                  Our customers are the heart of our business. They are the reason we exist and have been able to for the past sixty years. We serve 27 million people in our restaurants daily — each and every one of those people matters to us.
                  



                  How are you changing the way you think about ingredients?
                

                  We want our customers to feel good about the food they eat in our restaurants, which is why we’re making changes they will feel good about and taking a different approach to ingredients. We recognize our customers’ expectations have evolved and we’re evolving with them.
                  

                  In recent months we’ve made a number of changes to our menu items, which has included the removal of some ingredients, including the additive azodicarbonamide in our sandwich buns. In addition, we’ve also introduced a number of new menu items that highlight simple, everyday ingredients like our Artisan Grilled Chicken patty or our buttermilk Crispy Chicken, which uses real buttermilk in the breading.
                  

                  This continuation of the journey we began last year when we announced a number of other changes to our menu and how we source our food. These announcements included commitments to source chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine by 2017, only sourcing cage-free eggs for our breakfast menu items in the U.S. and Canada by 2025 and only offering milk jugs of low-fat white and fat-free chocolate milk from cows that have not been treated with rbST, an artificial growth hormone.
                  



                  Why is the All Day Breakfast Menu different in some locations?
                

                  When we launched the All Day Breakfast Menu, we changed up our whole way of doing things. We went from dividing breakfast and lunch to putting both on the table.
                  

                  Our biggest priority is always going to be delivering the quality of food you know and love. When we made the decision to make All Day Breakfast a reality, we had to look at how we prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bottom line: there wasn't enough room on our grills to make the eggs for both our McMuffins and our Biscuits.
                  

                  So, we worked with each restaurant to understand the most popular breakfast menu items in their area. This was our way of getting local customers the breakfast food they wanted.
                  

                  2015 is just the beginning of All Day Breakfast at McDonald's. We plan to continue to evolve the All Day Breakfast Menu as time goes on.
                  

                  Check out the official All Day Breakfast Menu, where items vary by location but deliciousness doesn't. And don't forget, the morning breakfast menu still offers all of your go-to favorites.
                  



                  Do you offer fruit and dairy options?
                

                  You bet! We’re committed to helping make nutrition-minded choices fun and easy for families and we’re proud to have increased access to key food groups like delicious fresh fruit and dairy. In fact, in March 2012, we began automatically including a fruit or low fat dairy side option with each Happy Meal, which makes it easier for your children to enjoy wholesome fruit and low fat dairy options when they eat at our restaurant.
                  

                  DYK that we’ve sold more that 1.5 billion packages of apple slices in Happy Meals since 2012? And that’s just the beginning… from seasonal Cuties to Go-GURT low fat strawberry yogurt to fat-free chocolate milk, there are many options for your family to enjoy.

                  Why are you partners with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation?
                

                  In 2013, we partnered with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation on a Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Commitment to make five commitments to increase access to fruits and vegetables and help families make more informed choices. This also supports our global food commitment to increase the amount of fruit, vegetable, low fat dairy and whole grains we serve by 2020.
                  

                  This partnership is just one way we’re making changes to help parents feel better about McDonald’s. An annual report from Keybridge, an independent firm, demonstrates our progress. See how we’re doing here.
                  



                  Do you use real butter?
                

                  Yes! Just like how you butter toast at home, we use real butter on our English muffins, biscuits and bagels on breakfast menu items, making mornings extra special.

Important Note:
At McDonald's, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu items to our customers each and every time they visit our restaurants. We understand that each of our customers has individual needs and considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their home, especially those customers with food allergies. As part of our commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information available from our food suppliers for the eight most common allergens as identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (eggs, dairy, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish), so that our guests with food allergies can make informed food selections. However, we also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation areas, equipment and utensils, and the possibility exists for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including allergens. We encourage our customers with food allergies or special dietary needs to visit www.mcdonalds.com for ingredient information, and to consult their doctor for questions regarding their diet. Due to the individualized nature of food allergies and food sensitivities, customers' physicians may be best positioned to make recommendations for customers with food allergies and special dietary needs. If you have questions about our food, please reach out to us directly at mcdonalds.com/contact or 1- 800-244-6227.
Nutrient contributions from individual components may not equal the total due to federal rounding regulations. Percent Daily Values (DV) and RDIs are based on unrounded values.

** Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.


The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing conducted in accredited laboratories, published resources, or from information provided from McDonald's suppliers. The nutrition information is based on standard product formulations and serving sizes (including ice for beverages). All nutrition information is based on average values for ingredients from McDonald's suppliers throughout the U.S. and is rounded to meet current U.S. FDA NLEA guidelines. Variation in serving sizes, preparation techniques, product testing and sources of supply, as well as regional and seasonal differences may affect the nutrition values for each product. In addition, product formulations change periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient content of the products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes may vary in your market. McDonald’s USA does not certify or claim any of its US menu items as Halal, Kosher or meeting any other religious requirements. We do not promote any of our US menu items as vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. The natural flavors that we use are derived from animal, plant, dairy or honey sources. Our fried menu items are cooked in a vegetable oil blend with citric acid added as a processing aid and dimethylpolysiloxane to reduce oil splatter when cooking. We are no longer adding TBHQ to our restaurant cooking oil, but as we transition to our new oil supply, some restaurants may have trace amounts of TBHQ in their cooking oil for a period of time. This information is correct as of February 2017, unless stated otherwise.

Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Mcdonald, Dean G carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Mcdonald, Dean G currently holds license MCDONDG906JR , which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Mcdonald, Dean G



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Mcdonald, Dean G



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
