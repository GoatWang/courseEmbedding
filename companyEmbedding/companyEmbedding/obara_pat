Resistance Welder



Equipment to weld thin steel plates by high current. A few thousand newtons of force and several thousand amperes of current generates heat in the steel palates, creating welding nuggets to weld the sheets together.












Arc Welding

Equipment to weld steel sheets by melting welding wires.  Gas supplied from the torch is protection of weld points as well as the source of heat.










Laser

YAG laser is used typically for local welding of various metals by converged Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser beam. YAG laser operates by laser light produced from optical pumping of YAG crystal. (Laser products and services are handled by our affiliate company.)
