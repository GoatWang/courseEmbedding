AT&T Digital Life Announces Plans to Integrate Products and Services from Lutron Electronics, Samsung, Qualcomm and LG Electronics 


Consumer /  Las Vegas, Nevada, Jan 05, 2015

Share





























New Products and Services Give Customers More Flexibility and Convenience to Manage their Homes

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 5, 2015 – AT&T1 today announced plans to expand the product and service offerings of AT&T Digital Life by integrating new products and services into its home security and automation platform.  AT&T is currently working with Lutron Electronics, Samsung, Qualcomm Life, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, and LG Electronics to provide more choice to customers with the ability to manage new capabilities from the AT&T Digital Life app.
Today’s announcement at the 2015 International CES® builds on efforts by Digital Life in 2014 to explore the possibilities of what a managed platform will mean. The move from a closed platform model to an open-standards managed platform will enable Digital Life to rapidly expand the types of services and products it is able to offer customers, as well as entering new markets while delivering an integrated experience.
“Innovation in home automation is skyrocketing, but to really drive mass adoption, we need to expand the strong platform that we have built working with key industry leaders and developers to bring the best ideas together to benefit the customer. That’s what we’re going to continue do in 2015,” said Kevin Petersen, Senior Vice President, AT&T Digital Life.
Digital Life enables customers to realize the benefits of the Internet of Things in ways that improve and simplify their lives. Controlling the ecosystem allows Digital Life to quickly introduce new capabilities by integrating devices and services from industry leaders, including:
· Lutron Electronics: Imagine waking up to the shades in your room opening to a preset time decided by you. In the future, Digital Life customers will be able to manage their Lutron devices, such as window shades and lighting controls through the Digital Life app.
· Samsung: In 2015, Samsung Techwin’s newest Wi-Fi IP camera will also be added to the Digital Life camera automation offerings, providing more options to customers as part of the growing Digital Life portfolio.  The SmartCam HD Pro brings supreme video quality by utilizing a Full HD 1080p image sensor and powered by a high-performance chipset developed by Samsung Techwin, which provides premium features like Wide Dynamic Range (WDR), Samsung Light Enhancer (SLE) technology and advanced motion detection to reduce false alerts and so customers can monitor their home from virtually anywhere on a mobile device. As an exhibit at the AT&T Digital Life booth at 2015 International CES®, Samsung has also created a prototype application on the Samsung Gear S™ to integrate with the Digital Life app, which allows the receipt of Digital Life notifications on the Gear S.
· Qualcomm Life: Qualcomm Life has enabled AT&T Digital Life to access Qualcomm Life’s 2net™ Platform and Hub, a medical-grade device connectivity platform and standalone gateway, with the goal of developing a solution to allow customers to seamlessly transmit biometric data such as blood pressure or weight, via the Digital Life app, enabling them to better manage their own health and the care of loved ones remotely.
· LG Electronics: Further demonstrating AT&T Digital Life’s smart home connectivity possibilities, LG is exhibiting a concept application at the AT&T Digital Life booth at 2015 International CES® showing how LG’s webOS Smart TV’s with AllJoyn capabilities could receive notifications and alerts from the Digital Life system. This concept demonstrates how, for example, a consumer might receive notifications on their LG TV if someone is at the front door or even be alerted if there is a leak in their basement.
“Digital Life plans to be able to welcome customers who are already integrated with these solutions from Lutron and Samsung Techwin to bring their devices and connect to Digital Life.  Likewise, we intend to allow our current customers to purchase these products and services and enjoy them as part of an integrated Digital Life experience,” added Petersen.
Currently available in 82 markets across the U.S., Digital Life is working strategically to expand its portfolio in existing and new markets.

AT&T shares rise more than 2% as company beats earnings expectations
Shares of AT&T  rose late Tuesday after the telecommunications company reported earnings above Wall Street expectations and sales in line with forecast. AT&T said it earned $3.9 billion, or 63 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $3.4 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 79 cents a share, compared with 72 cents a share a year ago. Sales fell to $39.8 billion, from $40.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, "primarily due to declines in legacy wireline services and consumer mobility," the company said in a statement. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted per-share earnings of 73 cents a share on sales of $39.8 billion. The shares ended the regular session down less than 0.1%.

AT&T shares rise more than 2% as company beats earnings expectations
Shares of AT&T  rose late Tuesday after the telecommunications company reported earnings above Wall Street expectations and sales in line with forecast. AT&T said it earned $3.9 billion, or 63 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $3.4 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 79 cents a share, compared with 72 cents a share a year ago. Sales fell to $39.8 billion, from $40.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, "primarily due to declines in legacy wireline services and consumer mobility," the company said in a statement. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted per-share earnings of 73 cents a share on sales of $39.8 billion. The shares ended the regular session down less than 0.1%.

Disney shares up almost 2% on report Verizon is eyeing deal
Shares of Walt Disney Co.  climbed 1.7% Monday, after the New York Post said a rumor circulated last week that Verizon Communications Inc.  is eyeing a purchase of Disney.

Verizon has just completed its acquisition of Yahoo Inc., and its rival AT&T Inc.  is in the midst of a deal for Time Warner Inc. .

AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate, headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas.[6] AT&T is the world's largest telecommunications company.[7] AT&T is the second largest provider of mobile telephone services and the largest provider of fixed telephone services in the United States,[8] and also provides broadband subscription television services through DirecTV; combined with AT&T's legacy U-verse service, this also makes AT&T the largest pay television operator. AT&T is the second-largest company in Texas, behind ExxonMobil.[9] As of February 2017[update], AT&T is the 12th largest company in the world (non-oil[10] and overall[11]) as measured by a composite of revenues, profits, assets and market valuation. AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the world by revenue. As of 2017[update], it is also the 18th-largest mobile telecom operator in the world, with 134 million mobile customers.[12] AT&T was ranked at #4 on the 2017 rankings of the world's most valuable brands published by Brand Finance.[13]
AT&T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (subsidiary of Bell Telephone Company, later AT&T Corporation) created in 1882. The divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (founded 1885, later AT&T Corporation) following the 1982 United States v. AT&T antitrust lawsuit. Southwestern Bell Corporation changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased former parent AT&T Corporation and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using the iconic AT&T Corp. logo and stock-trading symbol.
The current AT&T reconstitutes much of the former Bell System and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies, along with the original long distance division.[14]

History[edit]
Main article: History of AT&T
Origin and growth (1882–1981)[edit]
See also: History of AT&T § Origins, and History of AT&T § Monopoly
AT&T can trace its origin back to the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell after his invention of the telephone.[15] One of that company's subsidiaries was American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), established in 1885,[16] which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899, for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company. AT&T established a network of subsidiaries in the United States and Canada that held a government-authorized phone service monopoly, formalized with the Kingsbury Commitment, throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the Bell System,[17] and during this period, AT&T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell.[18] For periods of time, the former AT&T was the world's largest phone company.
Breakup and reformation (1982–2004)[edit]

See also: Breakup of AT&T and History of AT&T § Post break-up restructuring
In 1982, U.S. regulators broke up the AT&T monopoly, requiring AT&T to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, Baby Bells.[19] AT&T continued to operate long distance services, but as a result of this breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as MCI and Sprint.
Southwestern Bell was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&T. The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lasting through 2015).

See also: History of AT&T § Rise of SBC, and History of AT&T § Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions
In 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&T name and brand, with the original AT&T still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&T claims the original AT&T's history (dating to 1885) as its own, though its corporate structure only dates from 1983.[20] It also retains SBC's pre-2005 stock price history.
In September 2013, AT&T announced it would expand into Latin America through a collaboration with Carlos Slim's América Móvil.[21] In December 2013, AT&T announced plans to sell its Connecticut wireline operations to Stamford-based Frontier Communications.[22]
Recent developments (2014–2017)[edit]
See also: History of AT&T § Recent developments
In July 2015, AT&T purchased DirecTV for $48.5 billion, or $67.1 billion including assumed debt.[23] subject to certain conditions.[24][25] AT&T subsequently announced plans to converge its existing U-verse home internet and IPTV brands with DirecTV, to create AT&T Entertainment.[26][27][28]
AT&T purchased the Mexican carrier Iusacell in late 2014,[29] and two months later purchased the Mexican wireless business of NII Holdings,[30] merging the two companies to create AT&T Mexico.
In an effort to increase its media holdings,[31][32][33] on October 22, 2016, AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion.[34][35][36]
On July 13, 2017, it was reported that AT&T is going to introduce a cloud-based DVR streaming service as part of its effort to create a unified platform across DirecTV and its DirecTV Now streaming service, with U-verse to be added soon.[37][38][39]
Landline operating companies[edit]
Of the twenty-four companies that were part of the Bell System, ten are a part of the current AT&T:[40]

BellSouth Telecommunications (formerly known as Southern Bell; includes former South Central Bell)
Illinois Bell
Indiana Bell
Michigan Bell
Ohio Bell
Pacific Bell (formerly Pacific Telephone & Telegraph)

Nevada Bell (formerly known as Bell Telephone Company of Nevada)

The following companies have become defunct or were sold under SBC/AT&T ownership:

Southern New England Telephone: sold to Frontier Communications in 2014[41]

Woodbury Telephone: merged into Southern New England Telephone on June 1, 2007.



Future of rural landlines[edit]
AT&T stated that it would declare the intentions for its rural landlines on November 7, 2012.[42] AT&T had previously announced that it was considering a sale of its rural landlines, which are not wired for AT&T's U-verse service; however, it has also stated that it may keep the business after all.
AT&T was not the first Baby Bell to sell off rural landlines. Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin lines to CenturyTel in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel in the 2000s; U S WEST sold many historically Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and Pacific Telecom in the 1990s; Verizon sold many of its New England lines to FairPoint in 2008 and its West Virginia operations to Frontier Communications in 2010.
On October 25, 2014, Frontier Communications took over control of the AT&T landline network in Connecticut after being approved by state utility regulators. The deal worth about $2 billion included Frontier inheriting about 2,500 of AT&T's employees and many of AT&T's buildings.[43]

The company is headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas.[6] On June 27, 2008, AT&T announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from downtown San Antonio to One AT&T Plaza in downtown Dallas.[6][45] The company said that it moved to gain better access to its customers and operations throughout the world, and to the key technology partners, suppliers, innovation and human resources needed as it continues to grow, domestically and internationally.[46] AT&T Inc. previously relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio from St. Louis, Missouri in 1992, when it was then named Southwestern Bell Corporation. The company's Telecom Operations group, which serves residential and regional business customers in 22 U.S. states, remains in San Antonio.[citation needed] Atlanta, Georgia continues to be the headquarters for AT&T Mobility, with significant offices in Redmond, Washington, the former home of AT&T Wireless. Bedminster, New Jersey is the headquarters for the company's Global Business Services group and AT&T Labs. St. Louis continues as home to the company's Directory operations, AT&T Advertising Solutions.[47]
AT&T offers also services in many locations throughout the Asia Pacific; its regional headquarters is located in Hong Kong.[48] The company is also active in Mexico, and it was announced on November 7, 2014, that Mexican carrier Iusacell is being acquired by AT&T.[29] The acquisition was approved in January 2015.[citation needed] On April 30, 2015, AT&T acquired wireless operations Nextel Mexico from NII Holdings (now AT&T Mexico).[49]

Political involvement[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, AT&T is the second-largest donor to United States political campaigns,[52] and the top American corporate donor,[53] having contributed more than US$47.7 million since 1990, 56% of which went to Republicans and 44% of which went to Democrats.[54] As an example, in 2005, AT&T was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[55][56][57] Bill Leahy, representing AT&T, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[58] ALEC is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.[59][60][61]
During the period of 1998 to 2010, the company expended US$130 million on lobbying in the United States.[53] A key political issue for AT&T has been the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States.[62] The company has also lobbied in support of several federal bills. AT&T supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.[63] The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.[64] AT&T's Executive Vice President of Federal Relations, Tim McKone, said that the bill's "much needed institutional reforms will help arm the agency with the tools to keep pace with the Internet speed of today's marketplace. It will also ensure that outmoded regulatory practices for today's competitive marketplace are properly placed in the dustbin of history."[65]

Criticism and controversies[edit]
Hemisphere database[edit]
Main article: Hemisphere Project
The company maintains a database of call detail records of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987. AT&T employees work at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area offices (operated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy) in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Houston so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via administrative subpoena, without the involvement of a court or grand jury.
Censorship[edit]
In September 2007, AT&T changed its legal policy to state that "AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service,[69] any Member ID, electronic mail address, IP address, Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you, without notice for conduct that AT&T believes ... (c) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T, or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries."[70] By October 10, 2007, AT&T had altered the terms and conditions for its Internet service to explicitly support freedom of expression by its subscribers, after an outcry claiming the company had given itself the right to censor its subscribers' transmissions.[71] Section 5.1 of AT&T's new terms of service now reads "AT&T respects freedom of expression and believes it is a foundation of our free society to express differing points of view. AT&T will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns."[72]
Privacy controversy[edit]

Further information: NSA call database, Mark Klein, NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, and Hepting v. AT&T
In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged a class action lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&T, which alleged that AT&T had allowed agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. AT&T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, a retired former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation.[74][75] The Department of Justice has stated it will intervene in this lawsuit by means of State Secrets Privilege.[76]
In July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California – in which the suit was filed – rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[citation needed]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the National Security Agency by AT&T, Verizon, SBC, and BellSouth for the purpose of creating a massive calling database.[77] The portions of the new AT&T that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18, 2005, were not mentioned.
On June 21, 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that AT&T had rewritten rules on its privacy policy. The policy, which took effect June 23, 2006, says that "AT&T – not customers – owns customers' confidential info and can use it 'to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process.'"[78]
On August 22, 2007, National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell confirmed that AT&T was one of the telecommunications companies that assisted with the government's warrantless wire-tapping program on calls between foreign and domestic sources.[79]
On November 8, 2007, Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician, told Keith Olbermann of MSNBC that all Internet traffic passing over AT&T lines was copied into a locked room at the company's San Francisco office – to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access.[80]
AT&T keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages whom and the date and time, but not the content of the messages.[81]
Intellectual property filtering[edit]
In January 2008, the company reported plans to begin filtering all Internet traffic which passes through its network for intellectual property violations.[82] Commentators in the media have speculated that if this plan is implemented, it would lead to a mass exodus of subscribers leaving AT&T,[83] although this is misleading as Internet traffic may go through the company's network anyway.[82] Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated network neutrality.
Discrimination against local Public-access television channels[edit]
AT&T is accused by community media groups of discriminating against local Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels, by "impictions that will severely restrict the audience".[84]
According to Barbara Popovic, Executive Director of the Chicago public-access service CAN-TV, the new AT&T U-verse system forces all Public-access television into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard program guide, and DVR recording.[84] The Ratepayer Advocates division of the California Public Utilities Commission reported: "Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process."[84]
Sue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/Alliance for Community Media) argue that this is "an overall attack [...] on public access across the [United States], the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities".[84]
Information security[edit]
In June 2010, a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within AT&T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&T 3G service for the Apple iPad.[85] These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password.[86] Using a script, Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT&T.[85] Goatse Security informed AT&T about the security flaw through a third party.[87] Goatse Security then disclosed around 114,000 of these emails to Gawker Media, which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in Valleywag.[85][87] Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as "poorly designed".[85]
In April 2015, AT&T was fined $25m over data security breaches, marking the largest ever fine issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for breaking data privacy laws. The investigation revealed the theft of details of approximately 280,000 people from call centres in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines.[88]
Accusations of enabling fraud[edit]





This article may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints. Please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or discuss the issue on the talk page. (November 2016)


In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&T. The specific accusations state that AT&T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."[89]
Racism[edit]
On April 28, 2015, AT&T announced that it had fired Aaron Slator, President of Content and Advertising Sales, for sending racist text messages.[90] Slator was also hit with a $100 million discrimination lawsuit, filed by African-American employee Knoyme King.[91] The day before that, protesters arrived at AT&T's headquarters in Dallas and its satellite offices in Los Angeles as well as at the home of CEO Randall Stephenson to protest alleged systemic racial policies. According to accounts, the protesters are demanding AT&T begin working with 100% black-owned media companies.[92][better source needed]
Trademark violation[edit]
In June 2016, Citigroup sued AT&T for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. The company had recently established a loyalty program under the brand AT&T Thanks, which Citigroup claims would cause consumer confusion as an infringement of its "ThankYou" and "Citi ThankYou" marks due to similar wording and visual design. Citi, which also provides a co-branded credit card for AT&T that links with its ThankYou rewards program, sought unspecified damages and the expungement of AT&T's trademark registration.[93][94]
The suit was dismissed in August 2016, with a judge ruling that there was a low likelihood of confusion between the two marks because the companies fall within different industries, and that consumers who use loyalty programs would be able to "clearly take into account the attributes associated with the products they purchase" and, thus, be able to distinguish them.[95]

Verizon, on the other hand, keeps some information for up to a year that can be used to ascertain if a particular phone visited a particular Web site. According to the sheet, Sprint Nextel Corp.'s Virgin Mobile brand keeps the text content of text messages for three months. Verizon keeps it for three to five days. None of the other carriers keep texts at all, but they keep records of who texted who for more than a year. The document says AT&T keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages who —and when, but not the content of the messages. Virgin Mobile only keeps that data for two to three months.

AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate, headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas.[6] AT&T is the world's largest telecommunications company.[7] AT&T is the second largest provider of mobile telephone services and the largest provider of fixed telephone services in the United States,[8] and also provides broadband subscription television services through DirecTV; combined with AT&T's legacy U-verse service, this also makes AT&T the largest pay television operator. AT&T is the second-largest company in Texas, behind ExxonMobil.[9] As of February 2017[update], AT&T is the 12th largest company in the world (non-oil[10] and overall[11]) as measured by a composite of revenues, profits, assets and market valuation. AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the world by revenue. As of 2017[update], it is also the 18th-largest mobile telecom operator in the world, with 134 million mobile customers.[12] AT&T was ranked at #4 on the 2017 rankings of the world's most valuable brands published by Brand Finance.[13]
AT&T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (subsidiary of Bell Telephone Company, later AT&T Corporation) created in 1882. The divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (founded 1885, later AT&T Corporation) following the 1982 United States v. AT&T antitrust lawsuit. Southwestern Bell Corporation changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased former parent AT&T Corporation and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using the iconic AT&T Corp. logo and stock-trading symbol.
The current AT&T reconstitutes much of the former Bell System and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies, along with the original long distance division.[14]

History[edit]
Main article: History of AT&T
Origin and growth (1882–1981)[edit]
See also: History of AT&T § Origins, and History of AT&T § Monopoly
AT&T can trace its origin back to the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell after his invention of the telephone.[15] One of that company's subsidiaries was American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), established in 1885,[16] which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899, for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company. AT&T established a network of subsidiaries in the United States and Canada that held a government-authorized phone service monopoly, formalized with the Kingsbury Commitment, throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the Bell System,[17] and during this period, AT&T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell.[18] For periods of time, the former AT&T was the world's largest phone company.
Breakup and reformation (1982–2004)[edit]

See also: Breakup of AT&T and History of AT&T § Post break-up restructuring
In 1982, U.S. regulators broke up the AT&T monopoly, requiring AT&T to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, Baby Bells.[19] AT&T continued to operate long distance services, but as a result of this breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as MCI and Sprint.
Southwestern Bell was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&T. The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lasting through 2015).
SBC purchase and acquisitions (2005–2014)[edit]

See also: History of AT&T § Rise of SBC, and History of AT&T § Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions
In 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&T name and brand, with the original AT&T still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&T claims the original AT&T's history (dating to 1885) as its own, though its corporate structure only dates from 1983.[20] It also retains SBC's pre-2005 stock price history.
In September 2013, AT&T announced it would expand into Latin America through a collaboration with Carlos Slim's América Móvil.[21] In December 2013, AT&T announced plans to sell its Connecticut wireline operations to Stamford-based Frontier Communications.[22]
Recent developments (2014–2017)[edit]
See also: History of AT&T § Recent developments
In July 2015, AT&T purchased DirecTV for $48.5 billion, or $67.1 billion including assumed debt.[23] subject to certain conditions.[24][25] AT&T subsequently announced plans to converge its existing U-verse home internet and IPTV brands with DirecTV, to create AT&T Entertainment.[26][27][28]
AT&T purchased the Mexican carrier Iusacell in late 2014,[29] and two months later purchased the Mexican wireless business of NII Holdings,[30] merging the two companies to create AT&T Mexico.
In an effort to increase its media holdings,[31][32][33] on October 22, 2016, AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion.[34][35][36]
On July 13, 2017, it was reported that AT&T is going to introduce a cloud-based DVR streaming service as part of its effort to create a unified platform across DirecTV and its DirecTV Now streaming service, with U-verse to be added soon.[37][38][39]
Landline operating companies[edit]
Of the twenty-four companies that were part of the Bell System, ten are a part of the current AT&T:[40]

BellSouth Telecommunications (formerly known as Southern Bell; includes former South Central Bell)
Illinois Bell
Indiana Bell
Michigan Bell
Ohio Bell
Pacific Bell (formerly Pacific Telephone & Telegraph)

Nevada Bell (formerly known as Bell Telephone Company of Nevada)


Southwestern Bell
Wisconsin Bell (formerly Wisconsin Telephone)

Former operating companies[edit]

The following companies have become defunct or were sold under SBC/AT&T ownership:

Southern New England Telephone: sold to Frontier Communications in 2014[41]

Woodbury Telephone: merged into Southern New England Telephone on June 1, 2007.



Future of rural landlines[edit]
AT&T stated that it would declare the intentions for its rural landlines on November 7, 2012.[42] AT&T had previously announced that it was considering a sale of its rural landlines, which are not wired for AT&T's U-verse service; however, it has also stated that it may keep the business after all.
AT&T was not the first Baby Bell to sell off rural landlines. Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin lines to CenturyTel in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel in the 2000s; U S WEST sold many historically Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and Pacific Telecom in the 1990s; Verizon sold many of its New England lines to FairPoint in 2008 and its West Virginia operations to Frontier Communications in 2010.
On October 25, 2014, Frontier Communications took over control of the AT&T landline network in Connecticut after being approved by state utility regulators. The deal worth about $2 billion included Frontier inheriting about 2,500 of AT&T's employees and many of AT&T's buildings.[43]

Facilities and regions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (November 2016)


The company is headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas.[6] On June 27, 2008, AT&T announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from downtown San Antonio to One AT&T Plaza in downtown Dallas.[6][45] The company said that it moved to gain better access to its customers and operations throughout the world, and to the key technology partners, suppliers, innovation and human resources needed as it continues to grow, domestically and internationally.[46] AT&T Inc. previously relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio from St. Louis, Missouri in 1992, when it was then named Southwestern Bell Corporation. The company's Telecom Operations group, which serves residential and regional business customers in 22 U.S. states, remains in San Antonio.[citation needed] Atlanta, Georgia continues to be the headquarters for AT&T Mobility, with significant offices in Redmond, Washington, the former home of AT&T Wireless. Bedminster, New Jersey is the headquarters for the company's Global Business Services group and AT&T Labs. St. Louis continues as home to the company's Directory operations, AT&T Advertising Solutions.[47]
AT&T offers also services in many locations throughout the Asia Pacific; its regional headquarters is located in Hong Kong.[48] The company is also active in Mexico, and it was announced on November 7, 2014, that Mexican carrier Iusacell is being acquired by AT&T.[29] The acquisition was approved in January 2015.[citation needed] On April 30, 2015, AT&T acquired wireless operations Nextel Mexico from NII Holdings (now AT&T Mexico).[49]

Political involvement[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, AT&T is the second-largest donor to United States political campaigns,[52] and the top American corporate donor,[53] having contributed more than US$47.7 million since 1990, 56% of which went to Republicans and 44% of which went to Democrats.[54] As an example, in 2005, AT&T was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[55][56][57] Bill Leahy, representing AT&T, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[58] ALEC is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.[59][60][61]
During the period of 1998 to 2010, the company expended US$130 million on lobbying in the United States.[53] A key political issue for AT&T has been the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States.[62] The company has also lobbied in support of several federal bills. AT&T supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.[63] The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.[64] AT&T's Executive Vice President of Federal Relations, Tim McKone, said that the bill's "much needed institutional reforms will help arm the agency with the tools to keep pace with the Internet speed of today's marketplace. It will also ensure that outmoded regulatory practices for today's competitive marketplace are properly placed in the dustbin of history."[65]
Historical financial performance[edit]
The financial performance of the company is reported to shareholders on an annual basis and a matter of public record. The unit (except where noted) is billions of US dollars. Where performance has been restated, the most recent statement of performance from an annual report is used.[66][67][68][1]

Criticism and controversies[edit]
Hemisphere database[edit]
Main article: Hemisphere Project
The company maintains a database of call detail records of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987. AT&T employees work at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area offices (operated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy) in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Houston so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via administrative subpoena, without the involvement of a court or grand jury.
Censorship[edit]
In September 2007, AT&T changed its legal policy to state that "AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service,[69] any Member ID, electronic mail address, IP address, Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you, without notice for conduct that AT&T believes ... (c) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T, or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries."[70] By October 10, 2007, AT&T had altered the terms and conditions for its Internet service to explicitly support freedom of expression by its subscribers, after an outcry claiming the company had given itself the right to censor its subscribers' transmissions.[71] Section 5.1 of AT&T's new terms of service now reads "AT&T respects freedom of expression and believes it is a foundation of our free society to express differing points of view. AT&T will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns."[72]
Privacy controversy[edit]

Further information: NSA call database, Mark Klein, NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, and Hepting v. AT&T
In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged a class action lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&T, which alleged that AT&T had allowed agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. AT&T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, a retired former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation.[74][75] The Department of Justice has stated it will intervene in this lawsuit by means of State Secrets Privilege.[76]
In July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California – in which the suit was filed – rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[citation needed]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the National Security Agency by AT&T, Verizon, SBC, and BellSouth for the purpose of creating a massive calling database.[77] The portions of the new AT&T that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18, 2005, were not mentioned.
On June 21, 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that AT&T had rewritten rules on its privacy policy. The policy, which took effect June 23, 2006, says that "AT&T – not customers – owns customers' confidential info and can use it 'to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process.'"[78]
On August 22, 2007, National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell confirmed that AT&T was one of the telecommunications companies that assisted with the government's warrantless wire-tapping program on calls between foreign and domestic sources.[79]
On November 8, 2007, Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician, told Keith Olbermann of MSNBC that all Internet traffic passing over AT&T lines was copied into a locked room at the company's San Francisco office – to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access.[80]
AT&T keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages whom and the date and time, but not the content of the messages.[81]
Intellectual property filtering[edit]
In January 2008, the company reported plans to begin filtering all Internet traffic which passes through its network for intellectual property violations.[82] Commentators in the media have speculated that if this plan is implemented, it would lead to a mass exodus of subscribers leaving AT&T,[83] although this is misleading as Internet traffic may go through the company's network anyway.[82] Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated network neutrality.
Discrimination against local Public-access television channels[edit]
AT&T is accused by community media groups of discriminating against local Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels, by "impictions that will severely restrict the audience".[84]
According to Barbara Popovic, Executive Director of the Chicago public-access service CAN-TV, the new AT&T U-verse system forces all Public-access television into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard program guide, and DVR recording.[84] The Ratepayer Advocates division of the California Public Utilities Commission reported: "Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process."[84]
Sue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/Alliance for Community Media) argue that this is "an overall attack [...] on public access across the [United States], the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities".[84]
Information security[edit]
In June 2010, a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within AT&T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&T 3G service for the Apple iPad.[85] These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password.[86] Using a script, Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT&T.[85] Goatse Security informed AT&T about the security flaw through a third party.[87] Goatse Security then disclosed around 114,000 of these emails to Gawker Media, which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in Valleywag.[85][87] Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as "poorly designed".[85]
In April 2015, AT&T was fined $25m over data security breaches, marking the largest ever fine issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for breaking data privacy laws. The investigation revealed the theft of details of approximately 280,000 people from call centres in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines.[88]
Accusations of enabling fraud[edit]





This article may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints. Please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or discuss the issue on the talk page. (November 2016)


In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&T. The specific accusations state that AT&T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."[89]
Racism[edit]
On April 28, 2015, AT&T announced that it had fired Aaron Slator, President of Content and Advertising Sales, for sending racist text messages.[90] Slator was also hit with a $100 million discrimination lawsuit, filed by African-American employee Knoyme King.[91] The day before that, protesters arrived at AT&T's headquarters in Dallas and its satellite offices in Los Angeles as well as at the home of CEO Randall Stephenson to protest alleged systemic racial policies. According to accounts, the protesters are demanding AT&T begin working with 100% black-owned media companies.[92][better source needed]
Trademark violation[edit]
In June 2016, Citigroup sued AT&T for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. The company had recently established a loyalty program under the brand AT&T Thanks, which Citigroup claims would cause consumer confusion as an infringement of its "ThankYou" and "Citi ThankYou" marks due to similar wording and visual design. Citi, which also provides a co-branded credit card for AT&T that links with its ThankYou rewards program, sought unspecified damages and the expungement of AT&T's trademark registration.[93][94]
The suit was dismissed in August 2016, with a judge ruling that there was a low likelihood of confusion between the two marks because the companies fall within different industries, and that consumers who use loyalty programs would be able to "clearly take into account the attributes associated with the products they purchase" and, thus, be able to distinguish them.[95]

AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate, headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas.[6] AT&T is the world's largest telecommunications company.[7] AT&T is the second largest provider of mobile telephone services and the largest provider of fixed telephone services in the United States,[8] and also provides broadband subscription television services through DirecTV; combined with AT&T's legacy U-verse service, this also makes AT&T the largest pay television operator. AT&T is the second-largest company in Texas, behind ExxonMobil.[9] As of February 2017[update], AT&T is the 12th largest company in the world (non-oil[10] and overall[11]) as measured by a composite of revenues, profits, assets and market valuation. AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the world by revenue. As of 2017[update], it is also the 18th-largest mobile telecom operator in the world, with 134 million mobile customers.[12] AT&T was ranked at #4 on the 2017 rankings of the world's most valuable brands published by Brand Finance.[13]
AT&T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (subsidiary of Bell Telephone Company, later AT&T Corporation) created in 1882. The divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (founded 1885, later AT&T Corporation) following the 1982 United States v. AT&T antitrust lawsuit. Southwestern Bell Corporation changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased former parent AT&T Corporation and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using the iconic AT&T Corp. logo and stock-trading symbol.
The current AT&T reconstitutes much of the former Bell System and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies, along with the original long distance division.[14]

History[edit]
Main article: History of AT&T
Origin and growth (1882–1981)[edit]
See also: History of AT&T § Origins, and History of AT&T § Monopoly
AT&T can trace its origin back to the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell after his invention of the telephone.[15] One of that company's subsidiaries was American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), established in 1885,[16] which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899, for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company. AT&T established a network of subsidiaries in the United States and Canada that held a government-authorized phone service monopoly, formalized with the Kingsbury Commitment, throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the Bell System,[17] and during this period, AT&T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell.[18] For periods of time, the former AT&T was the world's largest phone company.
Breakup and reformation (1982–2004)[edit]

See also: Breakup of AT&T and History of AT&T § Post break-up restructuring
In 1982, U.S. regulators broke up the AT&T monopoly, requiring AT&T to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, Baby Bells.[19] AT&T continued to operate long distance services, but as a result of this breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as MCI and Sprint.
Southwestern Bell was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&T. The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lasting through 2015).

See also: History of AT&T § Rise of SBC, and History of AT&T § Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions
In 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&T name and brand, with the original AT&T still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&T claims the original AT&T's history (dating to 1885) as its own, though its corporate structure only dates from 1983.[20] It also retains SBC's pre-2005 stock price history.
In September 2013, AT&T announced it would expand into Latin America through a collaboration with Carlos Slim's América Móvil.[21] In December 2013, AT&T announced plans to sell its Connecticut wireline operations to Stamford-based Frontier Communications.[22]
Recent developments (2014–2017)[edit]
See also: History of AT&T § Recent developments
In July 2015, AT&T purchased DirecTV for $48.5 billion, or $67.1 billion including assumed debt.[23] subject to certain conditions.[24][25] AT&T subsequently announced plans to converge its existing U-verse home internet and IPTV brands with DirecTV, to create AT&T Entertainment.[26][27][28]
AT&T purchased the Mexican carrier Iusacell in late 2014,[29] and two months later purchased the Mexican wireless business of NII Holdings,[30] merging the two companies to create AT&T Mexico.
In an effort to increase its media holdings,[31][32][33] on October 22, 2016, AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner for $108.7 billion.[34][35][36]
On July 13, 2017, it was reported that AT&T is going to introduce a cloud-based DVR streaming service as part of its effort to create a unified platform across DirecTV and its DirecTV Now streaming service, with U-verse to be added soon.[37][38][39]
Landline operating companies[edit]
Of the twenty-four companies that were part of the Bell System, ten are a part of the current AT&T:[40]

BellSouth Telecommunications (formerly known as Southern Bell; includes former South Central Bell)
Illinois Bell
Indiana Bell
Michigan Bell
Ohio Bell
Pacific Bell (formerly Pacific Telephone & Telegraph)

Nevada Bell (formerly known as Bell Telephone Company of Nevada)


Southwestern Bell
Wisconsin Bell (formerly Wisconsin Telephone)

Former operating companies[edit]

The following companies have become defunct or were sold under SBC/AT&T ownership:

Southern New England Telephone: sold to Frontier Communications in 2014[41]

Woodbury Telephone: merged into Southern New England Telephone on June 1, 2007.



Future of rural landlines[edit]
AT&T stated that it would declare the intentions for its rural landlines on November 7, 2012.[42] AT&T had previously announced that it was considering a sale of its rural landlines, which are not wired for AT&T's U-verse service; however, it has also stated that it may keep the business after all.
AT&T was not the first Baby Bell to sell off rural landlines. Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin lines to CenturyTel in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel in the 2000s; U S WEST sold many historically Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and Pacific Telecom in the 1990s; Verizon sold many of its New England lines to FairPoint in 2008 and its West Virginia operations to Frontier Communications in 2010.
On October 25, 2014, Frontier Communications took over control of the AT&T landline network in Connecticut after being approved by state utility regulators. The deal worth about $2 billion included Frontier inheriting about 2,500 of AT&T's employees and many of AT&T's buildings.[43]

Facilities and regions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (November 2016)


The company is headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas.[6] On June 27, 2008, AT&T announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from downtown San Antonio to One AT&T Plaza in downtown Dallas.[6][45] The company said that it moved to gain better access to its customers and operations throughout the world, and to the key technology partners, suppliers, innovation and human resources needed as it continues to grow, domestically and internationally.[46] AT&T Inc. previously relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio from St. Louis, Missouri in 1992, when it was then named Southwestern Bell Corporation. The company's Telecom Operations group, which serves residential and regional business customers in 22 U.S. states, remains in San Antonio.[citation needed] Atlanta, Georgia continues to be the headquarters for AT&T Mobility, with significant offices in Redmond, Washington, the former home of AT&T Wireless. Bedminster, New Jersey is the headquarters for the company's Global Business Services group and AT&T Labs. St. Louis continues as home to the company's Directory operations, AT&T Advertising Solutions.[47]
AT&T offers also services in many locations throughout the Asia Pacific; its regional headquarters is located in Hong Kong.[48] The company is also active in Mexico, and it was announced on November 7, 2014, that Mexican carrier Iusacell is being acquired by AT&T.[29] The acquisition was approved in January 2015.[citation needed] On April 30, 2015, AT&T acquired wireless operations Nextel Mexico from NII Holdings (now AT&T Mexico).[49]

Political involvement[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, AT&T is the second-largest donor to United States political campaigns,[52] and the top American corporate donor,[53] having contributed more than US$47.7 million since 1990, 56% of which went to Republicans and 44% of which went to Democrats.[54] As an example, in 2005, AT&T was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[55][56][57] Bill Leahy, representing AT&T, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).[58] ALEC is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.[59][60][61]
During the period of 1998 to 2010, the company expended US$130 million on lobbying in the United States.[53] A key political issue for AT&T has been the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States.[62] The company has also lobbied in support of several federal bills. AT&T supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.[63] The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.[64] AT&T's Executive Vice President of Federal Relations, Tim McKone, said that the bill's "much needed institutional reforms will help arm the agency with the tools to keep pace with the Internet speed of today's marketplace. It will also ensure that outmoded regulatory practices for today's competitive marketplace are properly placed in the dustbin of history."[65]
Historical financial performance[edit]
The financial performance of the company is reported to shareholders on an annual basis and a matter of public record. The unit (except where noted) is billions of US dollars. Where performance has been restated, the most recent statement of performance from an annual report is used.[66][67][68][1]

Criticism and controversies[edit]
Hemisphere database[edit]
Main article: Hemisphere Project
The company maintains a database of call detail records of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987. AT&T employees work at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area offices (operated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy) in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Houston so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via administrative subpoena, without the involvement of a court or grand jury.
Censorship[edit]
In September 2007, AT&T changed its legal policy to state that "AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service,[69] any Member ID, electronic mail address, IP address, Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you, without notice for conduct that AT&T believes ... (c) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T, or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries."[70] By October 10, 2007, AT&T had altered the terms and conditions for its Internet service to explicitly support freedom of expression by its subscribers, after an outcry claiming the company had given itself the right to censor its subscribers' transmissions.[71] Section 5.1 of AT&T's new terms of service now reads "AT&T respects freedom of expression and believes it is a foundation of our free society to express differing points of view. AT&T will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns."[72]
Privacy controversy[edit]




Diagram of how alleged wiretapping worked. From EFF court filings[73]


Further information: NSA call database, Mark Klein, NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, and Hepting v. AT&T
In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged a class action lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&T, which alleged that AT&T had allowed agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. AT&T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, a retired former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation.[74][75] The Department of Justice has stated it will intervene in this lawsuit by means of State Secrets Privilege.[76]
In July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California – in which the suit was filed – rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[citation needed]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the National Security Agency by AT&T, Verizon, SBC, and BellSouth for the purpose of creating a massive calling database.[77] The portions of the new AT&T that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18, 2005, were not mentioned.
On June 21, 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that AT&T had rewritten rules on its privacy policy. The policy, which took effect June 23, 2006, says that "AT&T – not customers – owns customers' confidential info and can use it 'to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process.'"[78]
On August 22, 2007, National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell confirmed that AT&T was one of the telecommunications companies that assisted with the government's warrantless wire-tapping program on calls between foreign and domestic sources.[79]
On November 8, 2007, Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician, told Keith Olbermann of MSNBC that all Internet traffic passing over AT&T lines was copied into a locked room at the company's San Francisco office – to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access.[80]
AT&T keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages whom and the date and time, but not the content of the messages.[81]
Intellectual property filtering[edit]
In January 2008, the company reported plans to begin filtering all Internet traffic which passes through its network for intellectual property violations.[82] Commentators in the media have speculated that if this plan is implemented, it would lead to a mass exodus of subscribers leaving AT&T,[83] although this is misleading as Internet traffic may go through the company's network anyway.[82] Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated network neutrality.
Discrimination against local Public-access television channels[edit]
AT&T is accused by community media groups of discriminating against local Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels, by "impictions that will severely restrict the audience".[84]
According to Barbara Popovic, Executive Director of the Chicago public-access service CAN-TV, the new AT&T U-verse system forces all Public-access television into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard program guide, and DVR recording.[84] The Ratepayer Advocates division of the California Public Utilities Commission reported: "Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process."[84]
Sue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/Alliance for Community Media) argue that this is "an overall attack [...] on public access across the [United States], the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities".[84]
Information security[edit]
In June 2010, a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within AT&T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&T 3G service for the Apple iPad.[85] These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password.[86] Using a script, Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT&T.[85] Goatse Security informed AT&T about the security flaw through a third party.[87] Goatse Security then disclosed around 114,000 of these emails to Gawker Media, which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in Valleywag.[85][87] Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as "poorly designed".[85]
In April 2015, AT&T was fined $25m over data security breaches, marking the largest ever fine issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for breaking data privacy laws. The investigation revealed the theft of details of approximately 280,000 people from call centres in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines.[88]
Accusations of enabling fraud[edit]

In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&T. The specific accusations state that AT&T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."[89]
Racism[edit]
On April 28, 2015, AT&T announced that it had fired Aaron Slator, President of Content and Advertising Sales, for sending racist text messages.[90] Slator was also hit with a $100 million discrimination lawsuit, filed by African-American employee Knoyme King.[91] The day before that, protesters arrived at AT&T's headquarters in Dallas and its satellite offices in Los Angeles as well as at the home of CEO Randall Stephenson to protest alleged systemic racial policies. According to accounts, the protesters are demanding AT&T begin working with 100% black-owned media companies.[92][better source needed]
Trademark violation[edit]
In June 2016, Citigroup sued AT&T for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. The company had recently established a loyalty program under the brand AT&T Thanks, which Citigroup claims would cause consumer confusion as an infringement of its "ThankYou" and "Citi ThankYou" marks due to similar wording and visual design. Citi, which also provides a co-branded credit card for AT&T that links with its ThankYou rewards program, sought unspecified damages and the expungement of AT&T's trademark registration.[93][94]
The suit was dismissed in August 2016, with a judge ruling that there was a low likelihood of confusion between the two marks because the companies fall within different industries, and that consumers who use loyalty programs would be able to "clearly take into account the attributes associated with the products they purchase" and, thus, be able to distinguish them.[95]

None of the other carriers keep texts at all, but they keep records of who texted who for more than a year.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
