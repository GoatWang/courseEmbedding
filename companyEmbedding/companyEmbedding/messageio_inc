The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Message.io was founded in the spring of 2016 with the simple mission of enabling a write once and run everywhere philosophy for conversational interfaces (aka bots). 
We believe that conversational interfaces represent the future. They will redefine how work gets done as more people spend time utilizing message platforms. Our strategy is to let developers add, syndicate, and then manage their bots across any end point. 
We're an Austin-based company with a global footprint. We're building a team where everyone has an impact on our business, and more importantly helping spread the conversational future. We're seeking teammates who want the independence to achieve their goals while collaborating to bring our vision to our customers.

Building Developer Friendly Enterprise Bots

 March 17, 2017March 17, 2017 Cassie Bannister Botness Enterprise, Interviews, SXSW





For the fifth session of the day at Botness Enterprise, platform experts got to hang out and talk about best practices in building developer-friendly enterprise bots.

Kicking off the panel on #enterprise #bot platforms 🤖 including my favorite, @CiscoSpark :). See us at the #sxsw #SparkHaus #botness pic.twitter.com/E393eDIQoS

There were some fantastic insights, so definitely watch the video to see the full panel!
One of the main questions: what technologies should bot developers look into early? Bot to bot communication?
Everyone had a different answer. Amir Shevat, Director of Developer Relations at Slack, said although bot to bot isn’t the most urgent problem to be solving right now. First, create good apps, then let people collaborate to create things – give them as much canvas as possible.

Give bot builders as much canvas to do good shit. @ashevat #botness

Steven Goldsmith, General Manager of HipChat at Atlassian, said deep linking – when they acquired Trello, that was the first feature they offered.
John Wang, Director of Platform Products at RingCentral, mentioned helping users tie things together in a workflow – when you think about workflows where you need to interact with multiple bots, users need to check multiple systems, it makes sense to make these into a workflow.
Another important, broad question: what are the best practices?
Jose de Castro, CTO of APIs and Integrations at Cisco, said there’s a tendency to impart a certain amount of personality to a bot. By and large, the most successful bots aren’t humanlike, but instead, give the user superpowers. They’re extending human capabilities instead of trying to be human.

"Think about your users and try to extend their capabilities instead of pretend to be human." – @loopingrage of @CiscoSpark @ #Botness #sxsw

Tania McCormack, Director of Product for CA Flowdock, agrees – we don’t want bots to be human, but it’s important to remember to not bring habits (being bossy to bots) back to your team.
And Bill Bliss, Program Manager at Microsoft Teams, mentioned that the startup experience is key – don’t try to be cute. People try to be too creative. Setting clear expectations and communicating the value proposition up front is best practice.
