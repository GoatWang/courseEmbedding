MUTUAL FUND SPOTLIGHT

Near-Term Tax Free Fund
 The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests in municipal bonds with relatively short maturity. The fund seeks to provide tax-free monthly income by investing in debt securities issued by state and local governments from across the country.
Learn more about the Near-Term Tax Free Fund



  










Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by clicking here or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser. 
Read additional important information.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
Each of the mutual funds or services referred to in the U.S. Global Investors, Inc. website may be offered only to persons in the United States. This website should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment product or service to investors residing outside the United States.

Here Are the World's Top 10 Gold Producing Mines

Gold output across the globe hit an all-time high in 2015, climbing 1.8 percent
  to 3,211 tonnes. Much of this growth was led by Mexico, whose output increased
  double digits (18 percent) from 112 tonnes in 2014 to 133 tonnes last year.
  Indonesia grew 20 percent, Kazakhstan 29 percent.
This year, global production is expected to level out as project development
  budgets were slashed during the three-year gold bear market. But with gold
  prices rebounding, miners are in a good position to be much more profitable.
Below, explore and discover the world's top 10 gold producing mines.

The Boddington gold and copper deposit, located 75 miles southeast of Perth,
  Australia, is the country's largest gold mine. The first gold was poured in
  2009, and in 2011 Newmont produced its first one million ounces from the site.
  The mining company has identified gold reserves of 19.5 million ounces at Boddington
  and plans to spend half a billion dollars to expand production.

  Tinto. Australia-based Newcrest acquired the gold deposit in 2010 and has since
  struggled to keep operation costs under control. The company recently announced
  that expansion will cost a lot less expensive than initially thought, owing
  to new processing equipment that can more easily handle sulfur.

Wholly owned by Canadian miner Goldcorp, the Peñasquinto mine is located
  in the State of Zacatecas. It's the largest open pit mine in Mexico and the
  fifth largest silver mine in the world. Besides gold and silver, the project,
  in operation since March 2010, also yields zinc and lead. In 2007, Silver Wheaton
  entered into an agreement with Goldcorp to buy 25 percent of all silver output
  for the life of the mine.

Whether we're talking about glittering Las Vegas casinos or mining, gold and
  Nevada are nearly synonymous. The state accounts for 75 percent of total U.S.
  output, and it's even estimated to be responsible for producing 3 percent of
  all gold ever mined in human history. Much of this comes out of the state's
  Carlin Trend, the most abundant goldfield in the Western Hemisphere. Along
  the trend is Newmont's historic Carlin project, which consists of three open
  pits and four underground mines. In May 2015, the company celebrated 50 successful
  years of gold production at the site, which was the first in North America
  to generate more than one million ounces in a single year.

At more than 15,000 feet above sea level in Northern Peru, the Yanacocha project
  sits atop the Andean continental divide. It's the largest gold mine in Latin
  America, covering some 535 square miles. Consisting of five open pit mines,
  it's been producing gold since August 1993. Ownership of the mine is split
  among Newmont; Minas Buenaventura, a Peruvian company; and the International
  Finance Corporation, controlled by the World Bank.

A joint venture between Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold producer, and
  Goldcorp, the Pueblo Viejo mine is situated in the rolling green hills of central
  Dominican Republic, more than 60 miles north of its capital, Santo Domingo.
  The two Canadian companies took over the project in 2012 after the Dominican
  government unsuccessfully tried to mine it, with full production capacity reached
  in 2014. In August 2015, Barrick entered into a streaming contract with Royal
  Gold, whereby Royal agreed to front $610 million while Barrick is obligated
  to deliver 7.5 percent of all gold it produces at Pueblo Viejo.

Barrick employs 4,000 people in Nevada, or about a third of the state's entire
  mining industry labor force. Many of these people work at the company's Cortez
  operation, located in central Nevada. As one of Barrick's most promising ore
  bodies, the site is scheduled to receive $153 million from the company through
  2020. This will help expand its underground mining capacity, allowing it to
  produce an additional 300,000 ounces per year.

Since 1987, Barrick has operated the Goldstrike mine, also located in north-central
  Nevada. As the largest gold mine in North America, Goldstrike employs about
  1,700 people. Over the last couple of decades, workers have developed a new
  way to process ore at the site, known as "total carbonaceous matter leach," which
  will allow the company to repurpose lower-grade ores. The process is set to
  move out of its testing phase sometime this year.

High up in the rain-soaked mountains of Papua province, where earthquakes
  are not uncommon, sits the world's largest known gold reserve and second largest
  copper reserve. Roughly 18,000 people work at the Grasberg mine, for which
  a village, called Tembagapura, was constructed, containing roads, housing,
  schools, a hospital and an airport. Nearly a mile wide, the project consists
  of both an open pit and underground operation. The company is currently in
  negotiations with the Indonesian government to extend its mining contract,
  which is scheduled to expire in 2021.

Discovered in Uzbekistan's arid Kyzyl Kum Desert in 1958, the Muruntau gold
  deposit began operations in 1967. Today, it's the largest open pit mine by
  area and, at 1,900 feet deep, is the world's fifth deepest. The project, which
  also contains huge deposits of turquoise and arsenic, sits atop what many geologists
  believe could be the world's biggest gold reserve, with various estimates placing
  the amount at between 2,500 and a mind-boggling 5,300 tonnes.

Strengths

The best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, falling
    just 1.39 percent. Sillwater Mining’s CEO told investors that
    palladium prices are likely to rise further due to growing demand in China,
    despite auto sales declining in the U.S. Comments released by the Fed
    following Wednesday’s meeting, reinforcing the interest-rate hike
    schedule despite a slowdown in U.S. growth, left gold traders split this
    week. Bloomberg reports gold traders and analysts are divided on their gold
    price outlook with seven bullish, six bearish and three neutral. This week
    gold declined a bit, but Jonathan Barratt, CIO of Ayers Alliance, says
    these levels represent “fair value.” Similarly,
    BullionVault’s Gold Investor Index, measuring client buyers against
    sellers, fell to 52.1 versus 54.2 in March, as prices rallied during the
    month.
During the first quarter of the year, China’s demand for gold bars
    and coins jumped 30 percent year-over-year, reports China Daily. According
    to the World Gold Council, this is the fourth strongest quarter on record.
    Overall demand in the Chinese market grew 8 percent year-over-year, making
    China the world’s top gold consumer. In India, gold imports jumped to
    the highest level since 2014, with net inbound shipments more than doubling
    to 270.1 metric tons.
A Dubai technology company, OneGram, has started the first-ever currency
    backed by gold in an initial offering, reports Reuters and Bloomberg News,
    citing CEO Ibrahim Mohammed. “The token called OneGramCoin is
    considered an Islamic financial product, whose offering is open to all
    types of investors,” the article continues

Weaknesses

The worst performing precious metal for the week was silver, trading off
    5.02 percent followed closely by gold. Silver and gold fell this week as a
    tentative deal by U.S. Congress to avert a government shutdown curbed
    safe-haven demand for the precious metals, reports Bloomberg. Analysts from
    BOCI believe gold has a “more challenging” outlook moving
    forward, according to a report this week, citing two more rate hikes and
    the Fed’s balance sheet unwind. U.S. stocks resumed their advance
    this week, with optimistic earnings reports pushing the dollar back up and
    gold lower.
The Perth Mint released April sales numbers this week, reporting that
    April gold coin and minted bar sales came in at 10,490 ounces. This is a
    drop from sales of 22,232 ounces in March. Silver sales also dropped in
    April to 468,977 ounces from 716, 283 ounces in March.
Workers at Freeport McMoRan’s Grasberg copper and gold mine in
    Indonesia started to down their tools at 12am local time, reports
    Bloomberg. The company’s labor union and PTFI management have yet to
    agree on labor issues and around 8,000 employees have joined the stoppage.
    Workers plan to down tools until May 30 to protest job cuts, the article
    continues.

Opportunities

DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach believes that now is
    “not the time to give up on gold,” reports Bloomberg. In a
    Tuesday webcast, Gundlach said that gold prices are likely to head higher
    and also noted his secular bear view on oil prices because of improving
    fracking technology that cut costs. This week was a bad one for oil as it
    retreated to a level not seen since OPEC forged its landmark agreement to
    cut output last November, Bloomberg writes. “With all the shale
    producers coming online in the States, it’s very much taking the wind
    out of sails of the uptick we got from the OPEC agreement,” said
    James Audiss of Shaw and Partners.
In a press release Wednesday, Red Pine Exploration reported the
    intersection of visible gold in new drill holes south of its Surluga
    Deposit. “Visible gold observed in all seven holes drilled in the
    southern extension of the Minto Mine shear zone,” the release notes.
    In separate mining news, the Commission of Appointments in the Philippines
    has voted not to confirm Regina Lopez as Secretary of the Department of
    Environment and Natural Resources, reports Argonaut. Lopez had taken a hard
    stance on mining with a view that the sector had negatively impacted the
    environment and farming communities. Now mine closures are unlikely to
    proceed. Over to China, gold production in the first quarter saw a
    significant drop with mined output falling 9.3 percent. One report notes
    Chinese gold miners have reduced output due to low prices.
Klondex Mines (KDX CN, KLDX) reported financial results on Thursday after
    the close with the stock hitting a 52-week low that day. Klondex’s
    share price has been depressed by a series of events, much of which are
    unrelated to its operational performance. Back in March the Van Eck Vectors
    Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) was supposed to sell its top 3 holdings and
    reinvest the proceeds into existing holdings, which meant around 10 million
    shares would be bought by the ETF. However, the GDXJ ETF did not follow the
    asset mix provided by their index provider because they would have ended up
    owning 20 percent or more of the shares outstanding for many of their
    holdings, which would trigger certain Canadian stock exchange rules
    concerning takeovers. Next Klondex had to delay its operational reporting
    by one week because the shareholder base shifted to majority U.S. holders
    which required the company to switch from IFRS accounting to US GAAP.
    Klondex bought the True North Mine out of receivership and the Hollister
    acquisition from private owners last year. Although both properties had
    resources in the measured, indicated, and inferred categories there were no
    proven and probable reserves. Under SEC rules Klondex had to treat all the
    capital improvements on both properties as expenses, thus hitting the
    income statement, and appeared as though the company missed on its
    earnings. Later in mid-April, the GDXJ announced a new method for
    re-weighting the stocks it owns by down-weighting the existing holdings,
    including Klondex, and using the proceeds to buy mid-tier gold producers.
    The messaging on the Klondex earnings call on Friday was well received.
    Much of the re-positioning for the upcoming GDXJ rebalancing trade seems to
    be in the market now and investors now have a timely opportunity to buy
    Klondex Mines after touching a 52-week low, largely on issues unrelated to
    the operational performance of the company.

Threats

Major bulk miners have some of the same issues seen in the gold sector.
    According to a report from Deutsche Bank, large miners’
    “stay-in-business” (SIB) capex could increase 20 percent in
    2018. “While total capex will likely remain low near-term ($30
    billion in 2017, $90 billion in 2013), we will see sustaining/SIB capex
    increasing over the medium term as most miners catch up on the
    underinvestment over the past five years,” the report notes.
    Bottom-up analysis suggests that while truck fleet replacement will remain
    low, waste stripping will increase significantly, it continues.
In November, Steven Mnuchin hinted that the Trump administration would
    entertain the idea of selling ultra-long bonds, reports Bloomberg, with
    Wall Street coming to a consensus: Don’t do it! And on Monday, the
    article continues, Mnuchin provided the clearest signal saying this plan
    “could absolutely make sense.” Jeffrey Gundlach says that
    DoubleLine would not buy 100-year Treasuries for its mutual funds should
    they become available. In fact, he said “It opens the door to
    burdening our great-grandchildren to a significant degree.”
Investors pulled $778 million dollars from the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners
    ETF, reports Bloomberg, the largest outflows on record. The withdrawals
    coincided with the outcome of the first round of the French presidential
    elections, the article continues. In a similar note, Jeffries reported
    Monday that large cap ETFs increased their assets by 1.9 percent via
    inflows of almost $7.4 billion, with small caps increasing assets by 4.8
    percent via inflows of over $4 billion. The group also noted outflows
    across most of its categories being muted, with the biggest being
    technology and GLD, with about $216 million in withdrawals.

SWOT Analysis: Gold Has Outperformed the Stock Market Since 2000

Strengths



The best performing precious metal for the week was silver,       with a fall of just 0.51 percent with platinum just behind that. Following       wild price swings on heavy volume Monday and Tuesday in a suspected       erroneous trade, gold traders and analysts remained bullish for a second       week, reports Bloomberg. On Monday, 1.8 million ounces of the yellow metal       were sold in a single minute and on Tuesday prices spiked in early       European trading with about 815,000 ounces of gold bought in five minutes       – a suspected reverse on the Monday fat finger trade.
The euro has climbed to a 13-month high on speculation that       Mario Draghi’s ECB is poised to reduce unprecedented monetary stimulus,       writes Bloomberg News. This has allowed Europeans to pay the least this       year to buy gold, the article continues, while comments from Fed Chair       Janet Yellen this week did little to support the U.S. currency.
HKEK and the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society signed       MoU on Thursday to consider cooperation on matters such as product       promotion and storage vaults, according to a statement on the Hong Kong       Exchanges & Clearing website. MoU signifies strategic partnership that       aims to build a major gold and commodities trading center in Asia Pacific,       said CGSE President Haywood Cheung in a statement, reports Bloomberg.

Weaknesses

The worst performing precious metal for the week was palladium,       down 2.13 percent on money managers cutting their bullish bets on       palladium futures to the least bullish level in three weeks.  Bullion       for immediate delivery is down around 2 percent in June, reports       Bloomberg, and on course to end the longest run of monthly gains since       2010. Central banks around the world have taken a more hawkish stance on       monetary policy, curbing the appeal of assets that don’t pay interest.
On Monday, gold fell around $20 in a matter of seconds around       4am ET. While the yellow metal recovered a portion of those losses, it       still traded down 1 percent. “No-one has a clue, apart from the       unfortunate individual that pressed the wrong button,” David Govett, head       of precious metals trading at Marex Spectron Group, said about the unusual       plunge. Gold has gained 7.36 percent year-to-date, writes Bloomberg, but       has struggled to break through its pre-election level of about $1,300.
China’s gold imports from Hong Kong fell for a second month in       May, reports Bloomberg, as world prices wavered. Data from the Hong Kong       Census and Statistics Department show that the country purchased a net       44.8 metric tons, down from 74.9 tons in April.

Opportunities

According to Bloomberg, global central bankers are all hinting       that the cost of money is heading higher. Euro-area economic confidence       jumped to its highest level since August 2007 and German inflation       unexpectedly rose in June. In a note from BCA this week, the group writes:       “If the U.S. dollar turns and the downside pressure on their currencies       abate, emerging market central banks will no longer have to sell their FX       reserves. If the banks take advantage of currency stability/strength to       ease policy, it would underpin a cyclical improvement in their economies.       EM assets and commodity prices, along with commodity currencies, would       benefit if this would transpire.”
There are two major developments that have emerged in the       capital markets, writes Drew Mason of St. Joseph Partners. First, the       dollar has broken its long-term major uptrend of more than a decade.       Second, we’re seeing pressure on bonds, and long-term rates in particular       are rising. And, despite these trends capping gold’s performance, gold       (despite having no income stream attached to it as all the market pundits       point out) has still outperformed the stock market since 2000 at a ratio       of almost 2:1.
Despite opposition from nearly the entire Trump Cabinet, the       President and a few top advisers are “hell bent” on imposing tariffs on       steel imports of 20 percent, reports Seeking Alpha. Penalties could       eventually be extended to other imports too. In related sector news,       Societe Generale raised its 2017 aluminum and gold price outlook, while       cutting copper. Morgan Stanley listed palladium, gold and silver as its       top picks, while cutting nickel.

Threats

Tanzania’s parliament introduced three draft laws on Thursday,       that would allow it to force mining and energy companies to renegotiate       their contracts, reports CNBC. “They follow 18 months of wrangling between       mining companies and President John Magufuli that have delighted Tanzanian       voters but alarmed foreign investors,” the article continues. In a note       from Luke Nelson at JP Morgan, the draft regulations contain a number of concerning       provisions. For example, they suggest existing stability agreements could       be renegotiated should the National Assembly find their terms to be       “unconscionable.” Similarly, the drafts suggest future stabilization       agreements shall be time bound and make provision for periodic       renegotiation.
Gabriel Resources is seeking $4.4 billion from Romania for       destroying the value of the long-stalled gold mine project, reports       Bloomberg. Gabriel says the government has unlawfully blocked permits,       disregarded existing license rights and ignored all requests for       conciliation and negotiation. The company was once worth more than C$2.7       billion, but its value has collapsed to a fraction of that, the article       continues.
Although historical patterns are all pointing to the fact that       inflation should surge, these patterns may be in the process of breaking       with history, reports Bloomberg. “Global labor markets have seen profound       changes over the past decades, with significant implications for wage and       price information,” the Bank for International Settlements said. “The       question for many central banks is whether these developments have so       weakened the relationship between inflation and labor-market slack that       the recent tightening of labor markets poses little threat of an inflation       overshoot.”  Famous last words, perhaps.

I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
