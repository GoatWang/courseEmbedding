Investment Process

We screen companies proposed for investment using fundamental and  quantitative analysis. We evaluate them according to their growth,  profitability and value characteristics based on measures including revenues,  earnings, cash flow, dividend payout and return on equity. These  are standard yardsticks used to measure stocks.
We look carefully at a company’s business, its history and its industry in  an effort to assess the company’s prospects for growth.  Having identified  those companies that we believe offer the strongest prospects for future  growth, we typically construct stock portfolios holding stocks in varied  industries. Although we cannot eliminate the risk of stock ownership, we  believe that diversification across multiple industries is important to reduce  risk.
Buy Discipline: 

Peninsula Asset Management’s buy discipline for individual equities is primarily bottom-up, fundamental, Growth at a Reasonable Price. However, we do consider value investments when favorable opportunities present themselves.  
Equity databases are filtered using proprietary computer screening methodologies to identify the most attractive investment opportunities.  The focus of this part of the process is on earnings, cash flow, dividend trends, and valuation. 
In-depth fundamental security analysis is then performed on the computer-generated "short list" of attractive investment opportunities. We concentrate on issues of earnings and cash flow predictability and sustainability as well as industry position, capital structure, business drivers and valuation metrics. 
Target securities that are approved by the Investment Policy Committee are then added to individual client portfolios on a case-by-case basis. 
Risk management and control is maintained through sector and sub-sector diversification, active monitoring of risk exposures and strict adherence to client-specific investment policy guidelines for objectives and constraints.

Sell Discipline: 

We recognize that all stocks, including those of high-quality companies, tend to go through cycles that include periods of relative weakness. These periods of weakness may often be viewed as buying opportunities rather than selling triggers. 
There are four cases where we may sell a stock in client portfolios: 
                    
Intrinsic Value Attained. The price target has been reached and we cannot make a case for further multiple expansion, raising earnings estimates, or additional investment catalysts. 
Opportunity Cost. At a specific point in time, another security looks more attractive on a risk/reward basis. Thus, our clients would incur a potential opportunity cost if we failed to make the switch. 
Deterioration in Fundamentals or the thesis clearly not coming to fruition. Visible degradation in company or industry-wide fundamentals. For example, we would sell if sales growth unexpectedly and materially slowed, the sales mix deteriorated, pricing power was adversely impacted, anticipated product introductions were delayed, bellwether competitors or supplier fundamentals were hinting at a degrading situation in the future for our target company, etc. Additionally, if the rationale underpinning our investment thesis no longer seems reasonable, then we sell. 
Stock Price rolling over. Price performance is degrading relative to peer group comparables and/or the industry relative strength rolls over compared to the broader benchmark. When this occurs, we then go back and do further investigation (primarily fundamental analysis, rechecking news and information in the public domain, etc.). If the adverse price trend continues, we may sell. 



Bringing it all together: 

Implementation of the firm’s buy and sell disciplines (use of discounted cash flow models, valuation models, intrinsic value price targets etc.) ensures that we have actively-monitored portfolios to offer our clients. New ideas are added while we selectively prune old ideas that haven’t worked. 
Peninsula Asset Management actively reviews and rebalances individual client portfolios as necessary. 
Client contact and subsequent adjustments based upon changes in individual client circumstances completes the investment process feedback loop.

Investment Philosophy

We  believe that client investment objectives can best be achieved through  appropriate asset allocation and diversification to help control the level of  risk. We believe that financially sound companies with solid operating  histories and increasing dividend payouts can be excellent investments for  longer-term growth. We are not short-term traders or market timers, as we  believe that these strategies have limited potential for longer-term success.  We seek to produce above-average returns consistent with the level of risk  taken.
              We  measure our success by the progress made toward achieving each client’s  investment goals and relative performance to various market benchmarks along  the way. 
              At  Peninsula, stocks are selected for long-term  capital appreciation potential and secondarily, for income. Bonds and other  income-oriented securities such as preferred stocks are purchased to produce  income and help maintain principal stability. Cash is managed for liquidity,  stability and income. We are dedicated to capital appreciation and income  production, adhering to a philosophy of using high-quality investments.
              Peninsula  invests in individual stocks of larger, established companies that  have demonstrated consistent and sustainable long-term growth of  earnings.  Companies with an extensive history of consistent and  increasing dividends are preferred. Companies must be financially strong and  have the strategy, the flexibility and products in place that ensure continued  growth.  Peninsula may also invest in exchange-traded-funds or  exchange-traded-notes (often referred to as ETF’s/ETN’s) when appropriate for  diversification into mid-cap and small-cap stocks, international equities,  commodities and real estate.
              Portfolios with a balanced or income-orientation may also contain U.S.  Treasury securities, Government Agency bonds, corporate bonds and  preferred stocks. Depending upon a client’s tax situation, tax-exempt  municipal bonds may also be included. Our portfolios typically consist of bonds  with intermediate-term maturities, such as those in the 2 to 10 year range.  These maturities provide predictable cash flow and are not subject to the high  levels of principal risk associated with long-term bonds should interest rates  rise. Only "investment grade" bonds are purchased,  as determined by one or more of the rating services.
            We avoid investment strategies based largely on forecasting interest  rates or market timing because they often lead to extreme volatility in  absolute returns and inconsistent relative returns.

FAQ’s/Links

These are answers to our most frequently asked questions. If you have any other questions or a special situation to discuss with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.  
What amount of money is required to open an account with Peninsula Asset Management and how are fees determined?
           We typically recommend a minimum of $250,000 in cash and/or securities to open accounts.  However, we do encourage you to give us a call in any event so that we can discuss this further with you.  We do not work on commissions and do not “sell” products like annuities or mutual funds.  Our fees are based upon the values of the portfolios under management.
How is the company structured and is it independent? 
          Peninsula Asset Management is owned and operated by its portfolio managers.  The company was founded in 1982 and has been in business for over 25 years.  It is not affiliated with any bank, brokerage firm or other entity.
Does Peninsula have professionally educated, experienced financial professionals on staff?
            
         Peninsula`s staff has professional credentials including the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, the Accredited Asset Management Specialist designation and the Certified Financial Planner® designation. The CFA designation requires 18 hours of comprehensive examinations and is a globally recognized professional credential in the securities and asset management industry.  All of our portfolio managers have had extensive experience managing investment portfolios with bank trust departments before joining Peninsula Asset Management.  
If I entrust my money to you for management, what approach will you use in carrying out that management? Will these be sold? 
          Peninsula will, using its best judgment and an analysis of your personal financial situation, structure an investment portfolio designed to accomplish the goals that you and one of our portfolio managers agree upon at the time you become a client. We will use asset allocation as a key tool to attempt to obtain the level of investment return that is appropriate for your circumstances. For example, if a steady level of income to meet operating or living needs is more important than is long-term growth of capital, the portfolio will be designed to produce a steady, secure stream of income. If growth is more important, income will be de-emphasized, while investment in companies we believe are destined to grow in value will be emphasized. Many clients require or desire a balance between these two goals, so we frequently construct appropriately diversified portfolios in an effort to achieve both objectives.
As a potential client of Peninsula Asset Management, what evidence do I have of the firm’s integrity?
            
         Peninsula Asset Management has been in business since 1982. The firm is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Please call or e-mail  us and we will be happy to send you a copy of our ADV which will provide further information on our firm.  Please note that Peninsula does not take possession of your cash or securities at any time.  Your assets are securely held by a designated custodian bank or brokerage firm.  
What if I already have securities in my portfolio when I join Peninsula Asset Management as a client? Will these be sold? 
            
         In some cases they may be sold and in some cases they may be kept. This will depend upon several factors. Among the factors considered are (1) whether the security in question fits the appropriate asset allocation, (2) whether we judge the security to be of appropriate quality, (3) what, if any, would be the tax consequences of selling the security, and (4) our ability to follow a particular issue. 
How often will I receive a report from Peninsula Asset Management?
            
          Reports are sent out after the close of each calendar quarter. In addition, clients receive reports from their custodian bank or brokerage firm on a monthly basis. 
Will my reports provide information which will assist with the preparation of my tax returns?
            
         After the end of each calendar year, Peninsula will provide you with comprehensive schedules of realized capital gains and losses and income received that will be very helpful in the preparation of your tax returns.   
How often will I have the chance to talk with my portfolio manager?
            
         You will have direct access to your portfolio manager to discuss your account in a personal meeting or by phone.  Contact is intended to occur at a frequency to best meet the needs of each client. We encourage account reviews between client and portfolio manager at least annually.

Investment Process

We screen companies proposed for investment using fundamental and  quantitative analysis. We evaluate them according to their growth,  profitability and value characteristics based on measures including revenues,  earnings, cash flow, dividend payout and return on equity. These  are standard yardsticks used to measure stocks.
We look carefully at a company’s business, its history and its industry in  an effort to assess the company’s prospects for growth.  Having identified  those companies that we believe offer the strongest prospects for future  growth, we typically construct stock portfolios holding stocks in varied  industries. Although we cannot eliminate the risk of stock ownership, we  believe that diversification across multiple industries is important to reduce  risk.
Buy Discipline: 

Peninsula Asset Management’s buy discipline for individual equities is primarily bottom-up, fundamental, Growth at a Reasonable Price. However, we do consider value investments when favorable opportunities present themselves.  
Equity databases are filtered using proprietary computer screening methodologies to identify the most attractive investment opportunities.  The focus of this part of the process is on earnings, cash flow, dividend trends, and valuation. 
In-depth fundamental security analysis is then performed on the computer-generated "short list" of attractive investment opportunities. We concentrate on issues of earnings and cash flow predictability and sustainability as well as industry position, capital structure, business drivers and valuation metrics. 
Target securities that are approved by the Investment Policy Committee are then added to individual client portfolios on a case-by-case basis. 
Risk management and control is maintained through sector and sub-sector diversification, active monitoring of risk exposures and strict adherence to client-specific investment policy guidelines for objectives and constraints.

Sell Discipline: 

We recognize that all stocks, including those of high-quality companies, tend to go through cycles that include periods of relative weakness. These periods of weakness may often be viewed as buying opportunities rather than selling triggers. 
There are four cases where we may sell a stock in client portfolios: 
                    
Intrinsic Value Attained. The price target has been reached and we cannot make a case for further multiple expansion, raising earnings estimates, or additional investment catalysts. 
Opportunity Cost. At a specific point in time, another security looks more attractive on a risk/reward basis. Thus, our clients would incur a potential opportunity cost if we failed to make the switch. 
Deterioration in Fundamentals or the thesis clearly not coming to fruition. Visible degradation in company or industry-wide fundamentals. For example, we would sell if sales growth unexpectedly and materially slowed, the sales mix deteriorated, pricing power was adversely impacted, anticipated product introductions were delayed, bellwether competitors or supplier fundamentals were hinting at a degrading situation in the future for our target company, etc. Additionally, if the rationale underpinning our investment thesis no longer seems reasonable, then we sell. 
Stock Price rolling over. Price performance is degrading relative to peer group comparables and/or the industry relative strength rolls over compared to the broader benchmark. When this occurs, we then go back and do further investigation (primarily fundamental analysis, rechecking news and information in the public domain, etc.). If the adverse price trend continues, we may sell. 



Bringing it all together: 

Implementation of the firm’s buy and sell disciplines (use of discounted cash flow models, valuation models, intrinsic value price targets etc.) ensures that we have actively-monitored portfolios to offer our clients. New ideas are added while we selectively prune old ideas that haven’t worked. 
Peninsula Asset Management actively reviews and rebalances individual client portfolios as necessary. 
Client contact and subsequent adjustments based upon changes in individual client circumstances completes the investment process feedback loop.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
