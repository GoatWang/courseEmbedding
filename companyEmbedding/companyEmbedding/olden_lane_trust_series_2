Who We Are
Olden Lane Advisors LLC ("Olden Lane") is developing the next generation of liquid alternative investment products. We seek to bring new options to the liquid alternatives movement, offering potential advantages including liquidity, transparency, lower costs and faster development times.
We work closely with clients including institutional investors, private banks and wealth managers. Our Target Outcome Funds can be offered as '40 Act registered funds or customized private trusts, both of which can be tailored to meet investor requirements for specific exposures or target outcomes.
Traditionally alternative investments have allowed investors to diversify their portfolios with return streams less correlated to equities and fixed income investments. Our products hope to add a new set of options for investors beyond simple diversification.
Established in 2015, Olden Lane has built a team with decades of experience in alternative investments, liquid alternatives, product structuring and distribution – experience which has been central to our ability to innovate.

Our Philosophy
Olden Lane is grounded in a culture of high performance, operational excellence, and close partnership. We seek to provide a premium service to a select number of financial institutions. Transparency and clarity are the foundation of our work and the catalysts of our competitive edge in an underserved market.
one size does not fit all
Olden Lane believes that in investing "one size does not fit all." We work diligently to match an expected investment outcome to the needs of a particular investor. We can structure solutions utilizing both registered investment companies and private trusts; include credit enhancement features; and deliver specific investment exposures or target desired investment outcomes.
What you see iswhat you get
Olden Lane believes that a well-structured investment must include a clear statement of risks. We understand that many of our structures, even those which employ credit enhancements, have additional risks that must be considered before investment. To assist investors in understanding the risks inherent in an investment, Olden Lane is committed to a process of careful attention in construction and design and is highly focused on the presentation of risks in marketing and sales materials. We believe strongly that an investor should enter every investment decision with an accurate, clear and balanced articulation of how the product works.

Our Strategies
Our business responds to the growing demand for more liquid and regulated alternative investment products. Olden Lane works with institutional clients to provide solutions that might benefit individual and institutional clients alike. Growth is being driven by investor demand for strategies and asset classes that can diversify portfolios through income streams less correlated to equity and fixed income investments.
In working with clients, Olden Lane generally classifies alternative investment return streams into two categories.

Access products
Delivering exposure to a specific asset class or risk factor.
— For example, many of today’s investors are interested in accessing the return streams of asset classes traditionally beyond the reach of all but the most sophisticated investors.


Outcome products
Targeting a specific return unattainable though a traditional equity or fixed income investment.
— For example, an investor may desire an enhanced level of equity market upside or some protection against downside loss.


Next



Our Target Outcome Funds
 
Olden Lane’s Target Outcome Funds bring a new combination of capability and convenience to portfolio and risk management. This new family of innovative funds provides investors a broad set of alternatives to build more robust and resilient portfolios. Each Target Outcome Fund allows investors to participate in the return of a benchmark market index or other reference asset over a certain period of time and within specific risk constraints. These funds generally offer some measure of principal protection in exchange for a limit on participation in price appreciation. Some funds may also include features that leverage a particular return profile. In all cases, Target Outcome Funds are designed to provide an investor with the means to target an investment outcome aligned with his/her objectives and risk tolerance.
Target Outcome Funds are designed to reduce the risk and uncertainty inherent in the capital markets. The range of outcomes over a certain interval of time is defined when the fund is brought to market. The outcome orientation of these funds brings a new dimension to the rapidly growing market for index investing.  In a Target Outcome Fund, the uncertainty of an unconstrained allocation is replaced by a confidence in a controlled allocation. Target Outcome Funds encourage investors to consider how both positive and negative markets might affect their portfolios, allowing for better planning and portfolio management.

The Depositor may also concurrently with a subscription of units enter into contracts for the sale of such units (�Unit Sale Contracts�) with the purchaser�s obligations under the Unit Sale Contracts guaranteed by the National Securities Clearing Corporation and deliver to the Custodian, additional Securities, Contract Securities representing such additional Securities or a list of additional Securities which the Depositor shall cause to be purchased for the account of the related Company accompanied by cash and/or letter(s) of credit.��Pursuant
to the terms of the Services Agreement, the Depositor has assigned to Olden Lane Trust, as security for the Depositor�s obligations to make payment for purchase of Securities all of the Depositor�s interest in the Unit Sale Contracts and has appointed the Transfer Agent, as agent for Olden Lane Trust, as its attorney-in-fact with full authority to deliver units to the counterparties on behalf of the Depositor against payment.��The Trust, and the Transfer Agent on its behalf, may enforce all of the Depositor�s rights thereunder.
�
The Depositor shall verify with the Custodian the number of additional units to be created and additional Securities to be delivered and shall enter into contracts for the purchase of the additional Securities which the Depositor will cause to be purchased for the account of the Company.
�
On the settlement date for such subscription when the Transfer Agent is to deliver or assign the additional units, the Depositor shall deliver to the Custodian (a)�any additional Securities (or contracts to purchase such additional Securities together with cash or a Letter of Credit in the amount necessary to settle such contracts) or (b)�cash in an amount equal to the aggregate value of the additional Securities to be acquired by the Depositor for the account of the Company, and adding or subtracting the difference between such aggregate value and the value of the additional units as of the business day preceding the trade date.

� 


�
On the settlement date for such subscription, the Transfer Agent shall, in exchange for the Securities and cash or Letter of Credit described above, deliver to, or assign in the name of or on the order of, the Depositor, the verified number of additional units specified in the Depositor�s subscription notice for additional units.��The Depositor may continue to make additional deposits of Securities into a Company following the initial date of deposit, provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain, to the extent practicable, the quantity of Securities in such Company attributable to each unit existing on the initial date of deposit.
�
With respect to a Company having Derivative Agreements, the Depositor will enter into one or more Derivative Transactions on behalf of the Company.��The Depositor will, on behalf of the Company, execute and deliver such additional Derivative Agreements and related additional Derivative Transactions, provided that any such additional Derivative Agreements and additional Derivative Transactions will have terms which are, except for the quantity, the same as the initial Derivative Agreements and Derivative Transactions.��The Depositor will assure that all additional Derivative Agreements and Derivative Transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of additional units shall maintain, as nearly as practicable, the ratio of the quantity of Derivative
Transactions attributable to each unit existing on the initial date of deposit.��The Company�s obligations to pay any amounts due from the Company under a Derivative Agreement may be designated to be secured by a pledge in respect of the Company�s assets held in a Company Collateral Account.
�
The Depositor may not alter the portfolios of the Companies by the purchase, sale or substitution of Securities and/or Derivative Transactions, except in the circumstances noted below. Thus, with the exception of redemption or maturity of Securities or Derivatives Transactions in accordance with their terms (and reinvestments made in connection with certain Companies), the assets of the Company will remain unchanged under normal circumstances.
�
If necessary, in order to maintain the sound investment character of a Company, the Depositor may sell, liquidate, transfer, terminate or otherwise dispose of Securities or Derivative Transactions on behalf of such Company at such price and time and in such manner as shall be determined by the Depositor and to exercise any rights and powers of the Company as a party to a Derivative Agreement or any other agreement to which the Company is a party, provided that the Supervisor has determined in its sole and absolute discretion that any one or more of the following conditions exist with respect to such Securities or Derivative Transactions:

�




� 


(iii)


that there has occurred any breach of covenant or warranty in any document relating to an issuer of the Securities which would adversely affect either immediately or contingently the payment of interest, dividends or other amounts in respect of the relevant Securities, or the general credit standing of an issuer of Securities or a Derivative Counterparty or otherwise impair the sound investment character of such Securities or Derivative Transaction(s);



�




� 


(iv)


that there has been a default in the payment of interest, dividends, principal of or income or premium, if any, or any other amount payable on any other outstanding obligations of an issuer of Securities;



�




� 


(v)


that the Supervisor becomes of the opinion, as evidenced in writing to the Depositor and the Administrative & Custodial Parties, that the retention of certain Securities or Derivative Transaction(s) would be detrimental to the Company and to the interest of the unitholders due to (x)�a decline in the value of such Security or Derivative Transaction, (y)�a decline in the creditworthiness of an issuer of Securities, or (z)�the occurrence of other such credit factors;



�




� 


(vi)


that such sale or termination is required due to units tendered for redemption or to pay Company expenses;

� 


(vii)


that as of a record date, the Security is scheduled to be redeemed and paid prior to the related distribution date;

(xii)


that due to any law, regulation or regulatory request, rule, standard, guideline, policy, directive or guidance (whether formal or informal) in effect from time to time, it is unlawful or inadvisable for the Company, or it would result in material adverse consequences for the Company, to hold such Securities or be a party to such Derivative Transactions.



�
The proceeds from any such sales, exclusive of any portion which represents accrued interest, will be credited to the relevant Company Capital Account (as defined below) for distribution to unitholders.
�
In the event that an offer by the issuer of any of the Securities or any other party shall be made to issue new securities, or to exchange securities for Company Securities, including an exchange or substitution pursuant to a plan for the refunding or refinancing of Securities, the Custodian shall at the direction of the Supervisor, on behalf of the relevant Company, process the vote against such offer in the case of a Company that is a grantor trust, or accept or reject any such offer in the case of a Company that is a RIC for federal tax purposes.��Notwithstanding the forgoing, if (i)�the issuer is in default with respect to such Securities or (ii)�in the opinion of the Supervisor, given in writing to the Custodian, there is a reasonable likelihood that the issuer will default with respect to such Securities in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Depositor shall instruct the Custodian in writing to accept or reject such
offer or take any other action with respect thereto as the Supervisor may deem proper on behalf of the relevant Company. If any such issuance, exchange or substitution be effected, any securities, cash and/or property received shall be promptly sold, if securities or property, by the Depositor for the account of the Company, unless the Supervisor advises the Custodian to keep such securities, cash or property.��With respect to a Company which qualifies as a RIC and is an index trust (as such term is defined in the Services Agreement), the cash received in such exchange and cash proceeds of any such sales shall be reinvested by the Depositor, to the extent practicable, into any security which replaces such Security as a component of its target index or, if no security so replaces such Security, into any other Securities which are under-represented in the index trust�s portfolio in comparison
to their weighting in its target index, and to the extent not so reinvested shall be distributed pursuant to the following sentence.��With respect to all other Companies, the cash received in such exchange and cash proceeds of any such sales shall be credited to the Company Capital Account and distributed to unitholders.

�
A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market may cause units to be redeemed by the Transfer Agent by tendering units to the Transfer Agent.��The redemption process is described in response to Item�10(d).
�
The Depositor shall have the right to purchase units tendered for redemption and will make such purchase in no event subsequent to the Transfer Agent�s close of business on the day on which such unit was tendered for redemption.��Any unit purchased by the Depositor may at the option of the Depositor be tendered to the Transfer Agent for redemption in the manner provided in in response to Item�10(d).
�
For all redemptions, that portion of the Redemption Price which represents interest or dividends shall be withdrawn from the Company Income Account of such Company to the extent available.��The balance paid on any redemption, including accrued interest, if any, shall be withdrawn from the Company Capital Account and the Company Income Account of such Company to the extent that funds are available for such purpose.
�
The Supervisor, who may consult with the Depositor, will designate the Securities held in each Company to be sold and/or the relevant quantity of the Derivative Transactions of the Company to be terminated for the purpose of redemption of units tendered for redemption.
�
In the case of a Company with Derivatives Transactions, the Depositor shall take action to terminate the pro-rata portion of Derivatives Transactions allocable to the redeemed units within a time consistent with the liquidation of the related Securities.� Unitholders will not receive any type of �in-kind� distribution of Derivative Transactions.

(a)


Describe the procedure with respect to the receipt, custody and disposition of the income and other distributable funds of the trust and state the substance of the provisions of any indenture or agreement pertaining thereto.




�
Olden Lane Trust shall be composed of one or more separate series of beneficial interests in one or more segregated pools of assets of Olden Lane Trust (each of which will be a �Company� as referred to herein) under the DSTA, as amended from time to time, and each series of Olden Lane Trust shall be a separate series of trust within the meaning of the DSTA. As such, separate and distinct records shall be maintained for each Company, and the assets of Olden Lane Trust associated with any such series of Olden Lane Trust shall be held in separate and distinct records and accounted for in such separate and distinct records, apart from the



� 


-21-





� 


�
assets of Olden Lane Trust or any other series of Olden Lane Trust.��The assets of one series of Olden Lane Trust shall be segregated in the records maintained for separate series of Olden Lane Trust and the expenses of any one series of Olden Lane Trust shall not be charged against any other series of Olden Lane Trust.��Except as provided in the Services Agreement, units representing the ownership of an undivided beneficial interest in one series of Olden Lane Trust shall not be exchangeable for units representing the ownership of an undivided beneficial interest in any other series of Olden Lane Trust.
�
With respect to each Company, the Securities and Derivative Transactions and all other receipts are credited by the Custodian to a separate Capital Account for such Company (each such account for a Company, the �Company Capital Account�). With respect to each Company, the Custodian shall collect interest, dividends or other like cash distributions on the Securities held in the related Company Capital Account (including all moneys representing penalties for the failure to make timely payments on the Securities, or as liquidated damages for default or breach of any condition or term of the Securities and other income attributable to a failed contract security for which no replacement security has been obtained), and credit such income to a separate account for each Company (each such account for a Company, the �Company
Income Account�).
�
The Company normally has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives payments on the Securities delivered to the Company.��In the case of a fixed-income Company, since interest usually is paid semi-annually, during the initial months of a fixed-income Company, the Company Income Account, consisting of accrued but uncollected interest and collected interest (cash), will be predominantly the uncollected accrued interest that is not available for distribution.��Thereafter, assuming the Company retains its original size and composition, after deduction of the fees and expenses
and reimbursements to the Custodian for any amounts advanced to a Company, the Transfer Agent will normally distribute on each income distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record of such Company on the preceding record date.
�
The Custodian will place and maintain in the care of a foreign sub-custodian any Company�s foreign securities, cash and cash equivalents in amounts reasonably necessary to effect that Company�s foreign securities transactions with an entity in compliance with applicable law. Such entity may be an affiliate or subsidiary of the Custodian or any other entity in which the Custodian may have an ownership interest.

� 


(c)


If any reserves or special funds are created out of income or principal, state with respect to each such reserve or fund the purpose and ultimate disposition thereof, and describe the manner of handling the same.



�
With respect to each Company, the Custodian shall be directed by the Depositor to withdraw from the Company Capital Account or the Company Income Account of any Company such amounts, if any, as the Depositor deems necessary to establish a reserve for any taxes or other governmental charges or other fees or expenses payable out of the Company.��Amounts so withdrawn shall be credited to a separate reserve account maintained for a Company (the �Company Reserve Account�) as described in the Services Agreement.
�
Company Collateral Accounts. With respect to a Company having Derivatives Agreements, for each Derivative Counterparty, there will be one or more collateral accounts in the name of the Company into which the Custodian shall deposit assets of the Company (each, a �Company Collateral Account�).� There will be a lien on the assets of the Company Collateral Account in favor of the Derivative Counterparty to secure the performance of the Company�s obligations to the Derivative Counterparty under the related Derivative Agreement.� Assets therein
will not be transferred, used or re-hypothecated except (i) upon the written instruction of the Depositor, or, (ii) if the Depositor notifies the Custodian that an event of default under the Derivative Agreement has occurred with respect to which the Company is the defaulting party.
�
Counterparty Collateral Accounts. With respect to a Company having Derivatives Agreements, the Depositor shall cause each Derivative Counterparty to establish one or more collateral accounts in its name with a custodian bank, as custodian (the �Counterparty Collateral Accounts�) and Derivative Counterparty will deposit Derivative Counterparty assets therein and establish a lien on the assets of the Counterparty Collateral Account in favor of the Company to secure the performance of the Derivative Counterparty�s obligations to the Company under the related Derivative Agreement.� Assets therein shall remain under the sole dominion and control of the custodian and shall not be subject to transfer, use or re-hypothecation
except (i) upon the written instruction of the Derivative Counterparty in accordance with the relevant credit support agreement, or, (ii) upon an event of default under the Derivative Agreement in which the Derivative Counterparty is the defaulting party.

of Olden Lane Trust shall engage independent accountants to make such reviews of the portfolio of each Company as shall be necessary to maintain qualification of that Company as a RIC for tax purposes and to avoid imposition of tax on that Company or undistributed income in that Company.��The Depositor shall cause such independent accountants of the Company to prepare and file tax returns and prepare factors for the tax reporting for any Company that elects to be taxed as a RIC and shall supply the same to the Administrator for dissemination. The Depositor on behalf of Olden Lane Trust will sign all tax returns and other related documents.
�
Unless the Depositor determines that such an audit is not required, the Depositor shall cause the account of each Company to be audited not less than annually by independent public accountants designated from time to time by the Depositor

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 66 / Friday, April 7, 2017 / Notices

B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that
the proposed rule change will impose
any burden on competition that is not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purpose of the Act. The proposed
rule change is designed to enable all
issuers of securities that transfer listing
from any other national securities
exchange to benefit from the same
waiver with respect to Annual Fees for
a specified time period. Issuers have the
option to list their securities on
alternative venues based on the fees
charged and the value provided by such
venue. Because issuers have a choice to
list their securities on a different
national securities exchange, the
Exchange does not believe that the
proposed fee change imposes a burden
on competition. In addition, the waiver
of Annual Fees as described herein
would apply equally to all issuers.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Comments on the
Proposed Rule Change Received From
Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited
or received with respect to the proposed
rule change.

Commission Action
The foregoing rule change is effective
upon filing pursuant to Section
19(b)(3)(A) 7 of the Act and
subparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b–4 8
thereunder, because it establishes a due,
fee, or other charge imposed by the
Exchange.
At any time within 60 days of the
filing of such proposed rule change, the
Commission summarily may
temporarily suspend such rule change if
it appears to the Commission that such
action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, for the protection of
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of the Act. If the
Commission takes such action, the
Commission shall institute proceedings
under Section 19(b)(2)(B) 9 of the Act to
determine whether the proposed rule
change should be approved or
disapproved.
IV. Solicitation of Comments
Interested persons are invited to
submit written data, views, and

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application
may be obtained via the Commission’s
Web site by searching for the file
number, or an applicant using the
Company name box, at http://
www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by
calling (202) 551–8090.
Applicants’ Representations
1. Olden Lane Trust is a UIT that is
registered under the Act. Any future
Trust will be a registered UIT. Olden
Lane, a Delaware limited liability
company, is registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
broker-dealer and is the Depositor of
Olden Lane Trust. Each Series will be
created by a supplement to a master
trust agreement between the Depositor
and a banking institution or trust
company as trustee.
2. The Depositor acquires a portfolio
of securities, which it deposits with the
series custodian (‘‘Series Custodian’’) in
exchange for certificates representing
units of fractional undivided interest in
the Series’ portfolio (‘‘Units’’). The
Units are offered to the public through
the Depositor and dealers at a price
which, during the initial offering period,
is based upon the aggregate market
value of the underlying portfolio, or, the
aggregate offering side evaluation of the
underlying securities if the underlying
securities are not listed on a securities
exchange, plus a front-end sales charge,
a deferred sales charge or both. The
maximum sales charge may be reduced
in compliance with rule 22d–1 under
the Act in certain circumstances, which
are disclosed in the Series’ prospectus.
3. The Depositor may, but is not
legally obligated to, maintain a
secondary market for Units of an
outstanding Series. Other broker-dealers
may or may not maintain a secondary
market for Units of a Series. If a
secondary market is maintained,
investors will be able to purchase Units
on the secondary market at the current
public offering price plus a front-end

14:52 Apr 06, 2017

Jkt 241001

sales charge. If such a market is not
maintained at any time for any Series,
holders of the Units (‘‘Unitholders’’) of
that Series may redeem their Units
through the Series Custodian.
A. Deferred Sales Charge and Waiver of
Deferred Sales Charge Under Certain
Circumstances
1. Applicants request an order to the
extent necessary to permit one or more
Series to impose a sales charge on a
deferred basis (‘‘DSC’’). For each Series,
the Depositor would set a maximum
sales charge per Unit, a portion of which
may be collected ‘‘up front’’ (i.e., at the
time an investor purchases the Units).
The DSC would be collected
subsequently in installments
(‘‘Installment Payments’’) as described
in the application. The Depositor would
not add any amount for interest or any
similar or related charge to adjust for
such deferral.
2. When a Unitholder redeems or sells
Units, the Depositor intends to deduct
any unpaid DSC from the redemption or
sale proceeds. When calculating the
amount due, the Depositor will assume
that Units on which the DSC has been
paid in full are redeemed or sold first.
With respect to Units on which the DSC
has not been paid in full, the Depositor
will assume that the Units held for the
longest time are redeemed or sold first.
Applicants represent that the DSC
collected at the time of redemption or
sale, together with the Installment
Payments and any amount collected up
front, will not exceed the maximum
sales charge per Unit. Under certain
circumstances, the Depositor may waive
the collection of any unpaid DSC in
connection with redemptions or sales of
Units. These circumstances will be
disclosed in the prospectus for the
relevant Series and implemented in
accordance with rule 22d–1 under the
Act.
3. Each Series offering Units subject to
a DSC will state the maximum charge
per Unit in its prospectus. In addition,
the prospectus for such Series will
include the table required by Form N–
1A (modified as appropriate to reflect
the difference between UITs and openend management investment
companies) and a schedule setting forth
the number and date of each Installment
Payment, along with the duration of the
collection period. The prospectus also
will disclose that portfolio securities
may be sold to pay the DSC if
distribution income is insufficient and
that securities will be sold pro rata, if
practicable, otherwise a specific security
will be designated for sale.

B. Exchange Option and Rollover
Option
1. Applicants request an order to the
extent necessary to permit Unitholders
of a Series to exchange their Units for
Units of another Series (‘‘Exchange
Option’’) and Unitholders of a Series
that is terminating to exchange their
Units for Units of a new Series of the
same type (‘‘Rollover Option’’). The
Exchange Option and Rollover Option
would apply to all exchanges of Units
sold with a front-end sales charge, a
DSC or both.
2. A Unitholder who purchases Units
under the Exchange Option or Rollover
Option would pay a lower sales charge
than that which would be paid for the
Units by a new investor. The reduced
sales charge will be reasonably related
to the expenses incurred in connection
with the administration of the DSC
program, which may include an amount
that will fairly and adequately
compensate the Depositor and
participating underwriters and brokers
for their services in providing the DSC
program.
Applicants’ Legal Analysis
A. DSC and Waiver of DSC
1. Section 4(2) of the Act defines a
‘‘unit investment trust’’ as an
investment company that issues only
redeemable securities. Section 2(a)(32)
of the Act defines a ‘‘redeemable
security’’ as a security that, upon its
presentation to the issuer, entitles the
holder to receive approximately his or
her proportionate share of the issuer’s
current net assets or the cash equivalent
of those assets. Rule 22c–1 under the
Act requires that the price of a
redeemable security issued by a
registered investment company for
purposes of sale, redemption or
repurchase be based on the security’s
current net asset value (‘‘NAV’’).
Because the collection of any unpaid
DSC may cause a redeeming Unitholder
to receive an amount less than the NAV
of the redeemed Units, applicants
request relief from section 2(a)(32) and
rule 22c–1.
2. Section 22(d) of the Act and rule
22d–1 under the Act require a registered
investment company and its principal
underwriter and dealers to sell
securities only at the current public
offering price described in the
investment company’s prospectus, with
the exception of sales of redeemable
securities at prices that reflect
scheduled variations in the sales load.
Section 2(a)(35) of the Act defines the
term ‘‘sales load’’ as the difference
between the sales price and the portion
of the proceeds invested by the

E:\FR\FM\07APN1.SGM

07APN1

17050

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 66 / Friday, April 7, 2017 / Notices

nlaroche on DSK30NT082PROD with NOTICES

depositor or trustee. Applicants request
relief from section 2(a)(35) and section
22(d) to permit waivers, deferrals or
other scheduled variations of the sales
load.
3. Under section 6(c) of the Act, the
Commission may exempt classes of
transactions, if and to the extent that
such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of
the Act. Applicants state that their
proposal meets the standards of section
6(c). Applicants state that the provisions
of section 22(d) are intended to prevent
(a) riskless trading in investment
company securities due to backward
pricing, (b) disruption of orderly
distribution by dealers selling shares at
a discount, and (c) discrimination
among investors resulting from different
prices charged to different investors.
Applicants assert that the proposed DSC
program will present none of these
abuses. Applicants further state that all
scheduled variations in the sales load
will be disclosed in the prospectus of
each Series and applied uniformly to all
investors, and that applicants will
comply with all the conditions set forth
in rule 22d–1.
4. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act, in
relevant part, prohibits a trustee or
custodian of a UIT from collecting from
the trust as an expense any payment to
the trust’s depositor or principal
underwriter. Because the Series
Custodian’s payment of the DSC to the
Depositor may be deemed to be an
expense under section 26(a)(2)(C),
applicants request relief under section
6(c) from section 26(a)(2)(C) to the
extent necessary to permit the Series
Custodian to collect Installment
Payments and disburse them to the
Depositor. Applicants submit that the
relief is appropriate because the DSC is
more properly characterized as a sales
load.
B. Exchange Option and Rollover
Option
1. Sections 11(a) and 11(c) of the Act
prohibit any offer of exchange by a UIT
for the securities of another investment
company unless the terms of the offer
have been approved in advance by the
Commission. Applicants request an
order under sections 11(a) and 11(c) for
Commission approval of the Exchange
Option and the Rollover Option.
C. Net Worth Requirement
1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires
that a registered investment company
have $100,000 of net worth prior to
making a public offering. Applicants

VerDate Sep<11>2014

14:52 Apr 06, 2017

Jkt 241001

state that each Series will comply with
this requirement because the Depositor
will deposit more than $100,000 of
securities. Applicants assert, however,
that the Commission has interpreted
section 14(a) as requiring that the initial
capital investment in an investment
company be made without any intention
to dispose of the investment. Applicants
state that, under this interpretation, a
Series would not satisfy section 14(a)
because of the Depositor’s intention to
sell all the Units of the Series.
2. Rule 14a–3 under the Act exempts
UITs from section 14(a) if certain
conditions are met, one of which is that
the UIT invest only in ‘‘eligible trust
securities,’’ as defined in the rule.
Applicants state that they may not rely
on rule 14a–3 because certain Series
(collectively, ‘‘Structured Series’’) will
invest all or a portion of their assets in
equity securities, debt securities, shares
of registered investment companies,
Flexible Exchange® Options (‘‘FLEX
Options’’),2 or other assets which do not
satisfy the definition of eligible trust
securities.
3. Applicants request an exemption
under section 6(c) of the Act to the
extent necessary to exempt the
Structured Series from the net worth
requirement in section 14(a). Applicants
state that the Series and the Depositor
will comply in all respects with the
requirements of rule 14a–3, except that
the Structured Series will not restrict
their portfolio investments to ‘‘eligible
trust securities.’’
D. Capital Gains Distribution
1. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule
19b–1 under the Act provide that,
except under limited circumstances, no
registered investment company may
distribute long-term gains more than
once every twelve months. Rule 19b–
1(c), under certain circumstances,
exempts a UIT investing in eligible trust
securities (as defined in rule 14a–3)
from the requirements of rule 19b–1.
Because the Structured Series do not
limit their investments to eligible trust
securities, however, the Structured
Series will not qualify for the exemption
in paragraph (c) of rule 19b–1.
Applicants therefore request an
exemption under section 6(c) from
section 19(b) and rule 19b–1 to the
extent necessary to permit capital gains
earned in connection with the sale of
2 Applicants state that a Structured Series will
invest in FLEX Options with expiration dates that
coincide with the Structured Series’ maturity date
and any relief granted from the provisions of
sections 14(a) and 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b–
1 under the Act included in the Order will not
extend to any Series that intends to hold a
derivative security other than FLEX Options.

portfolio securities to be distributed to
Unitholders along with the Structured
Series’ regular distributions. In all other
respects, applicants will comply with
section 19(b) and rule 19b–1.
2. Applicants state that their proposal
meets the standards of section 6(c).
Applicants assert that any sale of
portfolio securities would be triggered
by the need to meet Trust expenses,
Installment Payments, or by redemption
requests, events over which the
Depositor and the Structured Series do
not have control. Applicants further
state that, because principal
distributions must be clearly indicated
in accompanying reports to Unitholders
as a return of principal and will be
relatively small in comparison to
normal dividend distributions, there is
little danger of confusion from failure to
differentiate among distributions.
Applicants’ Conditions
Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following conditions:
A. DSC Relief and Exchange and
Rollover Options
1. Whenever the Exchange Option or
Rollover Option is to be terminated or
its terms are to be amended materially,
any holder of a security subject to that
privilege will be given prominent notice
of the impending termination or
amendment at least 60 days prior to the
date of termination or the effective date
of the amendment, provided that: (a) No
such notice need be given if the only
material effect of an amendment is to
reduce or eliminate the sales charge
payable at the time of an exchange, to
add one or more new Series eligible for
the Exchange Option or the Rollover
Option, or to delete a Series which has
terminated; and (b) no notice need be
given if, under extraordinary
circumstances, either (i) there is a
suspension of the redemption of Units
of the Series under section 22(e) of the
Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or (ii) a Series
temporarily delays or ceases the sale of
its Units because it is unable to invest
amounts effectively in accordance with
applicable investment objectives,
policies and restrictions.
2. An investor who purchases Units
under the Exchange Option or Rollover
Option will pay a lower sales charge
than that which would be paid for the
Units by a new investor.
3. The prospectus of each Series
offering exchanges or rollovers and any
sales literature or advertising that
mentions the existence of the Exchange
Option or Rollover Option will disclose
that the Exchange Option and the

E:\FR\FM\07APN1.SGM

07APN1

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 66 / Friday, April 7, 2017 / Notices
Rollover Option are subject to
modification, termination or suspension
without notice, except in certain limited
cases.
4. Any DSC imposed on a Series’
Units will comply with the
requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2)
and (3) of rule 6c–10(a) under the Act.
5. Each Series offering Units subject to
a DSC will include in its prospectus the
disclosure required by Form N–1A
relating to deferred sales charges
(modified as appropriate to reflect the
differences between UITs and open-end
management investment companies)
and a schedule setting forth the number
and date of each Installment Payment.
B. Net Worth Requirement
Applicants will comply in all respects
with the requirements of rule 14a–3
under the Act, except that the
Structured Series will not restrict their
portfolio investments to ‘‘eligible trust
securities.’’
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

the most significant aspects of such
statements.

functionality and (ii) amend Rule 713
(Priority of Quotes and Orders) relating
to the priority of split price transactions.
The text of the proposed rule change
is available on the Exchange’s Web site
at www.ise.com, at the principal office
of the Exchange, and at the
Commission’s Public Reference Room.

‘‘Tick-Worse’’ Functionality
The Exchange currently provides
market makers 3 with Tick-Worse
functionality, which allows market
makers to pre-define the prices and
sizes at which the system will
automatically move their quotation
following an execution that exhausts the
size of their existing quotation.4 As
3 The term ‘‘market makers’’ refers to
‘‘Competitive Market Makers’’ and ‘‘Primary Market
Makers’’ collectively. See Rule 100(a)(25).
4 Tick-Worse functionality is not currently
memorialized in the Exchange’s rulebook. In
addition, the Exchange will not offer Tick-Worse on
the new Nasdaq INET system going forward. On
September 30, 2004, International Securities
Exchange, LLC (‘‘ISE’’) filed with the Commission
a proposal to codify this functionality in its
rulebook, but inadvertently deleted the rule as
obsolete rule text in a subsequent proposal filed on
December 21, 2012. See Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 51050 (January 18, 2005), 70 FR 3758
(January 26, 2005) (SR–ISE–2004–31); Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 68570 (January 3, 2013),
78 FR 1901 (January 9, 2013) (SR–ISE–2012–82).
The Exchange imported Rule 713 from ISE’s
rulebook when the Commission granted the
Exchange’s application for registration as a national
securities exchange, which was after the TickWorse functionality rule was inadvertently removed
from ISE’s rules. See Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 76998 (January 29, 2016), 81 FR 6066

such, when a market maker’s quote is
traded out, it can be automatically
reinstated into the Exchange’s order
book at the next best price.5 This
optional feature is intended to help
market makers meet their continuous
quoting obligations under the
Exchange’s rules 6 when their displayed
quotations are exhausted. When a
market maker’s quote is traded out and
automatically reinstated into the
Exchange’s order book using the TickWorse functionality, the reinstated
quote will be given priority pursuant to
the Exchange’s split price priority rule
as discussed below.
Due to the lack of demand for the
Tick-Worse feature, the Exchange
proposes to decommission the use of
this functionality as it migrates symbols
to INET no later than in 2017 Q3.7 As
discussed above, the Exchange offers the
Tick-Worse feature as a voluntary tool
for market makers to assist them in
meeting their continuous quoting
obligations under the Exchange’s rules.
As such, market makers are not required
to use the Exchange-provided
functionality and can program their own
systems to perform the same functions
if they prefer. The Exchange has found
that almost all market makers use their
own systems rather than the Exchange’s
Tick-Worse feature to send refreshed
quotations when their displayed
quotations are exhausted, and therefore
members have discontinued use of this
functionality. Because the Tick-Worse
functionality is currently not
memorialized in the Exchange’s rules as
noted above, there is no text of the
proposed rule change. The Exchange
will provide advance notice to its
Members through an Options Trader
Alert of the intent to decommission the
Tick-Worse functionality.8
(February 4, 2016) (Order Granting Registration as
a National Securities Exchange).
5 Market makers may choose to set Tick-Worse
parameters by specifying how many price ticks
back, and for what size, the quote is to be
reinstated.
6 Specifically, Primary Market Makers (‘‘PMMs’’)
are required under Rule 804(e)(1) to enter
quotations in all of the series listed on the Exchange
of the options classes to which they are appointed
on a daily basis. Supplementary Material .01 to
Rule 804 further requires PMMs to quote 90% of
the time their assigned options class is open for
trading on the Exchange. As provided in Rule
804(e)(2), Competitive Market Makers (‘‘CMMs’’)
are not required to enter quotations in the options
class to which they are appointed, but in the event
a CMM does initiate quoting, such CMM is
generally required to quote 60% of the time its
assigned options class is open for trading on the
Exchange.
7 Currently, this functionality is being used by
one market maker on the Exchange.
8 The Exchange notes that it similarly
decommissioned Tick-Worse on ISE Gemini, LLC

Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant 
using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or 
by calling (202) 551-8090.

Applicants' Representations

    1. Olden Lane Trust is a UIT that is registered under the Act. Any 
future Trust will be a registered UIT. Olden Lane, a Delaware limited 
liability company, is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 as a broker-dealer and is the Depositor of Olden Lane Trust. Each 
Series will be created by a supplement to a master trust agreement 
between the Depositor and a banking institution or trust company as 
trustee.
    2. The Depositor acquires a portfolio of securities, which it 
deposits with the series custodian (``Series Custodian'') in exchange 
for certificates representing units of fractional undivided interest in 
the Series' portfolio (``Units''). The Units are offered to the public 
through the Depositor and dealers at a price which, during the initial 
offering period, is based upon the aggregate market value of the 
underlying portfolio, or, the aggregate offering side evaluation of the 
underlying securities if the underlying securities are not listed on a 
securities exchange, plus a front-end sales charge, a deferred sales 
charge or both. The maximum sales charge may be reduced in compliance 
with rule 22d-1 under the Act in certain circumstances, which are 
disclosed in the Series' prospectus.
    3. The Depositor may, but is not legally obligated to, maintain a 
secondary market for Units of an outstanding Series. Other broker-
dealers may or may not maintain a secondary market for Units of a 
Series. If a secondary market is maintained, investors will be able to 
purchase Units on the secondary market at the current public offering 
price plus a front-end sales charge. If such a market is not maintained 
at any time for any Series, holders of the Units (``Unitholders'') of 
that Series may redeem their Units through the Series Custodian.

A. Deferred Sales Charge and Waiver of Deferred Sales Charge Under 
Certain Circumstances

    1. Applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit 
one or more Series to impose a sales charge on a deferred basis 
(``DSC''). For each Series, the Depositor would set a maximum sales 
charge per Unit, a portion of which may be collected ``up front'' 
(i.e., at the time an investor purchases the Units). The DSC would be 
collected subsequently in installments (``Installment Payments'') as 
described in the application. The Depositor would not add any amount 
for interest or any similar or related charge to adjust for such 
deferral.
    2. When a Unitholder redeems or sells Units, the Depositor intends 
to deduct any unpaid DSC from the redemption or sale proceeds. When 
calculating the amount due, the Depositor will assume that Units on 
which the DSC has been paid in full are redeemed or sold first. With 
respect to Units on which the DSC has not been paid in full, the 
Depositor will assume that the Units held for the longest time are 
redeemed or sold first. Applicants represent that the DSC collected at 
the time of redemption or sale, together with the Installment Payments 
and any amount collected up front, will not exceed the maximum sales 
charge per Unit. Under certain circumstances, the Depositor may waive 
the collection of any unpaid DSC in connection with redemptions or 
sales of Units. These circumstances will be disclosed in the prospectus 
for the relevant Series and implemented in accordance with rule 22d-1 
under the Act.
    3. Each Series offering Units subject to a DSC will state the 
maximum charge per Unit in its prospectus. In addition, the prospectus 
for such Series will include the table required by Form N-1A (modified 
as appropriate to reflect the difference between UITs and open-end 
management investment companies) and a schedule setting forth the 
number and date of each Installment Payment, along with the duration of 
the collection period. The prospectus also will disclose that portfolio 
securities may be sold to pay the DSC if distribution income is 
insufficient and that securities will be sold pro rata, if practicable, 
otherwise a specific security will be designated for sale.

B. Exchange Option and Rollover Option

    1. Applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit 
Unitholders of a Series to exchange their Units for Units of another 
Series (``Exchange Option'') and Unitholders of a Series that is 
terminating to exchange their Units for Units of a new Series of the 
same type (``Rollover Option''). The Exchange Option and Rollover 
Option would apply to all exchanges of Units sold with a front-end 
sales charge, a DSC or both.
    2. A Unitholder who purchases Units under the Exchange Option or 
Rollover Option would pay a lower sales charge than that which would be 
paid for the Units by a new investor. The reduced sales charge will be 
reasonably related to the expenses incurred in connection with the 
administration of the DSC program, which may include an amount that 
will fairly and adequately compensate the Depositor and participating 
underwriters and brokers for their services in providing the DSC 
program.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

A. DSC and Waiver of DSC

    1. Section 4(2) of the Act defines a ``unit investment trust'' as 
an investment company that issues only redeemable securities. Section 
2(a)(32) of the Act defines a ``redeemable security'' as a security 
that, upon its presentation to the issuer, entitles the holder to 
receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuer's 
current net assets or the cash equivalent of those assets. Rule 22c-1 
under the Act requires that the price of a redeemable security issued 
by a registered investment company for purposes of sale, redemption or 
repurchase be based on the security's current net asset value 
(``NAV''). Because the collection of any unpaid DSC may cause a 
redeeming Unitholder to receive an amount less than the NAV of the 
redeemed Units, applicants request relief from section 2(a)(32) and 
rule 22c-1.
    2. Section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22d-1 under the Act require a 
registered investment company and its principal underwriter and dealers 
to sell securities only at the current public offering price described 
in the investment company's prospectus, with the exception of sales of 
redeemable securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in 
the sales load. Section 2(a)(35) of the Act defines the term ``sales 
load'' as the difference between the sales price and the portion of the 
proceeds invested by the

[[Page 17050]]

depositor or trustee. Applicants request relief from section 2(a)(35) 
and section 22(d) to permit waivers, deferrals or other scheduled 
variations of the sales load.
    3. Under section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission may exempt classes 
of transactions, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the 
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy 
and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that their proposal meets 
the standards of section 6(c). Applicants state that the provisions of 
section 22(d) are intended to prevent (a) riskless trading in 
investment company securities due to backward pricing, (b) disruption 
of orderly distribution by dealers selling shares at a discount, and 
(c) discrimination among investors resulting from different prices 
charged to different investors. Applicants assert that the proposed DSC 
program will present none of these abuses. Applicants further state 
that all scheduled variations in the sales load will be disclosed in 
the prospectus of each Series and applied uniformly to all investors, 
and that applicants will comply with all the conditions set forth in 
rule 22d-1.
    4. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits a 
trustee or custodian of a UIT from collecting from the trust as an 
expense any payment to the trust's depositor or principal underwriter. 
Because the Series Custodian's payment of the DSC to the Depositor may 
be deemed to be an expense under section 26(a)(2)(C), applicants 
request relief under section 6(c) from section 26(a)(2)(C) to the 
extent necessary to permit the Series Custodian to collect Installment 
Payments and disburse them to the Depositor. Applicants submit that the 
relief is appropriate because the DSC is more properly characterized as 
a sales load.

B. Exchange Option and Rollover Option

    1. Sections 11(a) and 11(c) of the Act prohibit any offer of 
exchange by a UIT for the securities of another investment company 
unless the terms of the offer have been approved in advance by the 
Commission. Applicants request an order under sections 11(a) and 11(c) 
for Commission approval of the Exchange Option and the Rollover Option.

C. Net Worth Requirement

    1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires that a registered investment 
company have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering. 
Applicants state that each Series will comply with this requirement 
because the Depositor will deposit more than $100,000 of securities. 
Applicants assert, however, that the Commission has interpreted section 
14(a) as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment 
company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment. 
Applicants state that, under this interpretation, a Series would not 
satisfy section 14(a) because of the Depositor's intention to sell all 
the Units of the Series.
    2. Rule 14a-3 under the Act exempts UITs from section 14(a) if 
certain conditions are met, one of which is that the UIT invest only in 
``eligible trust securities,'' as defined in the rule. Applicants state 
that they may not rely on rule 14a-3 because certain Series 
(collectively, ``Structured Series'') will invest all or a portion of 
their assets in equity securities, debt securities, shares of 
registered investment companies, Flexible Exchange[supreg] Options 
(``FLEX Options''),\2\ or other assets which do not satisfy the 
definition of eligible trust securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Applicants state that a Structured Series will invest in 
FLEX Options with expiration dates that coincide with the Structured 
Series' maturity date and any relief granted from the provisions of 
sections 14(a) and 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b-1 under the Act 
included in the Order will not extend to any Series that intends to 
hold a derivative security other than FLEX Options.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act to 
the extent necessary to exempt the Structured Series from the net worth 
requirement in section 14(a). Applicants state that the Series and the 
Depositor will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 
14a-3, except that the Structured Series will not restrict their 
portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.''

D. Capital Gains Distribution

    1. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b-1 under the Act provide 
that, except under limited circumstances, no registered investment 
company may distribute long-term gains more than once every twelve 
months. Rule 19b-1(c), under certain circumstances, exempts a UIT 
investing in eligible trust securities (as defined in rule 14a-3) from 
the requirements of rule 19b-1. Because the Structured Series do not 
limit their investments to eligible trust securities, however, the 
Structured Series will not qualify for the exemption in paragraph (c) 
of rule 19b-1. Applicants therefore request an exemption under section 
6(c) from section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to 
permit capital gains earned in connection with the sale of portfolio 
securities to be distributed to Unitholders along with the Structured 
Series' regular distributions. In all other respects, applicants will 
comply with section 19(b) and rule 19b-1.
    2. Applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of 
section 6(c). Applicants assert that any sale of portfolio securities 
would be triggered by the need to meet Trust expenses, Installment 
Payments, or by redemption requests, events over which the Depositor 
and the Structured Series do not have control. Applicants further state 
that, because principal distributions must be clearly indicated in 
accompanying reports to Unitholders as a return of principal and will 
be relatively small in comparison to normal dividend distributions, 
there is little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate among 
distributions.

Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will 
be subject to the following conditions:

A. DSC Relief and Exchange and Rollover Options

    1. Whenever the Exchange Option or Rollover Option is to be 
terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a 
security subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of 
the impending termination or amendment at least 60 days prior to the 
date of termination or the effective date of the amendment, provided 
that: (a) No such notice need be given if the only material effect of 
an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge payable at the 
time of an exchange, to add one or more new Series eligible for the 
Exchange Option or the Rollover Option, or to delete a Series which has 
terminated; and (b) no notice need be given if, under extraordinary 
circumstances, either (i) there is a suspension of the redemption of 
Units of the Series under section 22(e) of the Act and the rules and 
regulations promulgated thereunder, or (ii) a Series temporarily delays 
or ceases the sale of its Units because it is unable to invest amounts 
effectively in accordance with applicable investment objectives, 
policies and restrictions.
    2. An investor who purchases Units under the Exchange Option or 
Rollover Option will pay a lower sales charge than that which would be 
paid for the Units by a new investor.
    3. The prospectus of each Series offering exchanges or rollovers 
and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of 
the Exchange Option or Rollover Option will disclose that the Exchange 
Option and the

[[Page 17051]]

Rollover Option are subject to modification, termination or suspension 
without notice, except in certain limited cases.
    4. Any DSC imposed on a Series' Units will comply with the 
requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of rule 6c-10(a) under 
the Act.
    5. Each Series offering Units subject to a DSC will include in its 
prospectus the disclosure required by Form N-1A relating to deferred 
sales charges (modified as appropriate to reflect the differences 
between UITs and open-end management investment companies) and a 
schedule setting forth the number and date of each Installment Payment.

B. Net Worth Requirement

    Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of 
rule 14a-3 under the Act, except that the Structured Series will not 
restrict their portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.''

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.

Assistant Secretary.

Financial Group, LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC, and an indirect majority owned subsidiary of Institutional Financial Markets, Inc. (NYSE MKT: IFMI)) ("JVB Financial") today announced that it has partnered with Olden Lane Securities LLC ("Olden Lane") to launch a new series of innovative unit investment trusts (UITs) called Target Outcome Funds.    Target Outcome Funds are a new category of UITs developed by Olden Lane and designed to offer a liquid, transparent and cost-effective vehicle for outcome-driven returns.  Through combining US Treasuries and exchange-listed option contracts which reference ETFs tracking broad-based equity indexes, Target Outcome Funds can offer efficient exposure to equity-market benchmarks within certain risk parameters, such as protection against downside risk.  UITs developed on Olden Lane's platform are designed to provide better liquidity and transparency, and lower counterparty risk, versus similar products currently offered as structured notes. The first series, offered by JVB Financial, is titled "Capped Performance Portfolio with Buffer Protection Linked to the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust" and seeks leveraged capital appreciation based on the three year price performance of the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. The Trust's return will be subject to a cap of 25% and will seek to provide protection against the first 15% of any decline in the price of the reference fund, in each case, before fees and expenses."The leveraged buffered strategy has been a very popular structure used in wealth management channels for years. We've seen advisors and portfolio managers invest hundreds of millions of dollars in this strategy in the form of structured notes," said John G. Tessar III, CFP®, Head of Structured Investments at JVB Financial. "Through our partnership with Olden Lane, we can now offer a similar strategy in UIT form with improved price transparency, daily pricing and liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk." "We are excited to partner with JVB Financial to launch our first product in what will be the next generation of liquid alternatives," said Michel S. Serieyssol, Olden Lane Founding Partner.  "Our firm was founded on the belief that UITs offer a superior structure for outcome-driven investments. We've refined and improved the UIT architecture so that it can be utilized as an innovative portfolio management tool to help investors manage their portfolios with greater discipline, purpose and risk management.  UITs developed on our platform offer strong liquidity and transparency, reduced counterparty risk, and '40 Act registration, resulting in more compelling and effective products for investors."Olden Lane, established in 2015, has assembled a team with decades of experience in alternative investments, liquid alternatives, product structuring and distribution – experience which has been central to the firm's ability to innovate.For more information about JVB Financial and Olden Lane, please visit www.jvbfinancial.com and www.oldenlane.com, respectively.____________________________________________________Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus.

Cap Trigger Performance Portfolio
�
Linked to the S&P 500� Index
�
Due [●], 2018
�


�
�OVERVIEW
�
The Olden Lane Outcome Series Cap Trigger Performance Portfolio is Olden Lane Trust Series 1, a unit investment trust (the �Trust�) that will issue units (the �units�) linked to the price performance of the S&P 500� Index (the �reference index�) with contingent capital protection up to the trigger level on the termination date. Olden Lane Securities LLC (�Olden Lane�) serves as sponsor of the Trust.
�
Investing in the units involves significant risks. As described in detail below, should the final index level be less than the trigger level, you will suffer substantial losses on your initial investment. While you may redeem your units as described in �Selling Units� in Part B of this prospectus, the downside market exposure to the reference index has the full benefit of contingent protection and a minimum distribution only on the termination date.
�
�INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
�
The Trust seeks capital appreciation linked to the price performance of the S&P 500� Index, subject to a maximum gain of [●]% and providing contingent capital protection if the final index level is equal to or greater than the trigger level on a termination date approximately 3 years from the inception date of the Trust. There is no assurance that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.
�
�PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
�
General
�
The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a combination of (i) U.S. Treasury obligations (the �treasury obligations�) that will mature on or shortly before the termination date and (ii) �over-the-counter� options transactions linked to the performance of the reference index (the �options agreements�).��The final distribution amount per unit is expected to be as follows (subject to potential reduction for expenses, as described below):
�
(i)�������If the index return is positive, the Trust will pay you $1,000 plus a return equal to the lesser of (a) the index return multiplied by the participation rate of [100]% or (b) the maximum gain of [●]%.
�
(ii)�������If the index return is zero or negative but the final index level is equal to or greater than the trigger level, the Trust will pay you $1,000.
�
(iii)�������If the index return is negative and the final index level is less than the trigger level, the Trust will pay you the $1,000 reduced by the index return, subject to a minimum distribution of [$200] per unit (the �minimum distribution�). If the final index level is less than the trigger level, you will suffer substantial losses on your initial investment. Unitholders who purchase at prices more than $1,000 will suffer greater losses.
�
In all cases (including in the case of the minimum distribution described above), the final distribution amount will be increased by the interest earned by the Trust from its portfolio of treasury obligations or decreased by any periodic ongoing fees as described below under �Expenses of the Trust.�
�
The "index return" will equal the quotient of (a) the final index level minus the initial index level, divided by (b) the initial index level.
�


� 


A-1





� 


�
The �initial index level� is the closing level of the reference index at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the inception date, as specified under �Essential Information.�
�
The �final index level� is the closing level of the reference index on the determination date.
�
The �trigger level� means the percentage specified under �Essential Information.�
�
The �participation rate� means the percentage specified under �Essential Information.�
�
The �closing level� of the reference index on any business day will be determined based on the closing level of the reference index or, if the reference index is unavailable, any successor index or alternative calculation of such index, published following the regular official weekday close of the principal trading session of the primary exchange for the index constituents of the reference index, as determined by the evaluator.
�
The �inception date� for your units will be the date specified under �Essential Information.���The level of the reference index is observed at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the inception date in order to determine the initial index level and establish the trigger level.
�
The �determination date� for your units will be the date specified under �Essential Information,� or if such date is not a business day, the following business day unless Olden Lane determines that a market disruption event has occurred or is continuing on such day with respect to the reference index. In that event, the determination date for the reference index will be the first following business day on which the closing level of such reference index is determinable and on which Olden Lane determines that a market disruption event has not occurred and is not continuing with respect to the reference index.��In no event, however, will the determination date for the units be postponed by more than eight (8) business days. The eight (8) business day period may be shortened in order to comply with legal restrictions applicable to the Trust. We further describe market disruption
events under �Market Disruption Events� below.
�
The �termination date� for your units is scheduled to be the date specified under �Essential Information,� unless that day is not a business day, in which case the termination date will be the next following business day. If Olden Lane postpones the determination date, the termination date will be automatically postponed to maintain the same number of business days between the latest postponed determination date and the termination date as existed prior to the postponement(s) of the determination date.
�
A �business day� is a day, as determined by Olden Lane, on which trading is generally conducted on the primary securities exchange(s) or market(s) on which the common stocks of the 500 companies comprising the reference index as of a particular time (the �index constituents�) are listed or admitted for trading.
�
Treasury Obligations:��The treasury obligations consist of interest-bearing obligations issued by the United States Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
�
Options Agreements:��The options agreements are contracts between the Trust and each of [●] and [●] (each, an �options counterparty�). The Trust has entered into options agreements with two options counterparties. Under the terms of each option agreement, if the index return is positive, the relevant options counterparty agrees to pay the Trust on the termination date an amount per unit equal to product of $1,000, multiplied by the lesser of (a) the index return multiplied by the participation rate or (b) the maximum gain of [●]%. Under each option agreement, if the index return is negative and the final index level is less than the trigger level, the Trust agrees to pay the relevant options counterparty on the termination date an amount per unit equal to the lesser of
(a) the product of (i) $1,000 multiplied by (ii) the absolute value of the index return, and (b) $[800]. Neither the Trust nor the options counterparties will make a payment on the termination date in the case where the final index level is between the initial index level and the trigger level.
�
The options agreements will be designed such that the value of the options agreements at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the inception date will equal 
�


� 


A-2





� 


�
zero and as of such time neither the Trust nor the options counterparties will owe a payment to the other to enter into the options agreements.
�
Distributions
�
The Trust is required to distribute at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. While a portion of the interest income received by the Trust from the treasury obligations and cash will be used for the payment of Trust expenses as described below, the units are expected to pay distributions on each semi-annual distribution date to unitholders of record on the immediately preceding record dates. The record and distribution dates are specified under �Essential Information.� Unitholders should expect to receive current income from the Trust. If, however, Trust expenses exceed interest received, Olden Lane may be required to sell Trust property to meet such expenses. In that case, the Trust may be unable to meet its investment objectives and investors may incur greater losses (or receive smaller gains) than described above. See �Principal
Risks � Sale of Trust Property to Pay Trust Expenses� below.
�
Collateralization of Options Agreements
�
To secure each options counterparty's performance under the options agreements and to help assure that the Trust (and thus the unitholders) will receive any payment owed under such options agreements, each options counterparty will establish a segregated collateral account with an independent U.S. bank as custodian. Under the options agreements, each options counterparty will be required to deposit collateral consisting of cash and short-term treasury obligations with a value equal to at least any amount owed by it under the relevant options agreements, subject to daily de minimis transfer minimums of [$5,000]. Olden Lane will monitor the collateral accounts and the transfers therein on a daily basis. Other than to secure the performance of the options counterparties under the options agreements, the collateral is not Trust property or subject to the use of the Trust.
�
Conversely, to secure the Trust's performance under the options agreements and to help assure that each options counterparty will receive any payment owed to it under such options agreements, the Trust will establish collateral accounts with an independent U.S. bank as custodian, into which the Trust shall deposit treasury obligations and cash to secure its performance under the options agreements to each options counterparty.��Olden Lane will monitor the collateral accounts and the transfers therein on a daily basis.��Other than to secure the performance of the Trust under the options agreements, the collateral is Trust property and not property or subject to the use of either options counterparty.
�
The evaluator for the Trust, Olden Lane Advisors LLC, will determine the amount, if any, that each options counterparty owes the Trust or the amount that the Trust owes each options counterparty under the options agreements.��Such determination will be made as of each business day and in a manner consistent with the procedure by which the evaluator performs evaluations of options agreements as described in �Selling Units�Redemption�Computation of Redemption Price� in Part B of this prospectus.
�
�ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE OPTIONS COUNTERPARTIES
�
The options counterparties are [●] and [●]. Neither the units nor the Trust are sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by the options counterparties. Neither options counterparty acts as adviser, sponsor, depositor, principal, underwriter or promoter of the Trust. The options counterparties (i) do not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, to the unitholders, (ii) are not responsible for and have not participated in the determination of the timing or quantities of the units to be issued, and (iii) have no obligation or liability in connection with the administration, operation, marketing, sale or trading of the units.

The final index level is generally based upon the closing level of the reference index on the determination date. The determination date for any offering of the units may be postponed if Olden Lane determines that, on the determination date, a market disruption event has occurred or is continuing with respect to the reference index. If such a postponement occurs, Olden Lane will determine the closing level on the first business day on which the closing level of the reference index is observable and no market disruption event occurs or is continuing with respect to the reference index. In no event, however, will the determination date for the units be postponed by more than eight (8) business days. The eight (8) business day period may be shortened in order to comply with legal restrictions applicable to the Trust.
�
If the determination date is postponed to the last possible day, as described above, but a market disruption event occurs or is continuing on that day, that day will nevertheless be the date on which the determination of the final index level will be made by Olden Lane. In such an event, Olden Lane will make an estimate of the final index level for the reference index based on its good estimate of the values of the index constituents of the reference index that would have prevailed in the absence of the market disruption event.
�
Market Disruption Events for a Reference Index
�
Any of the following will be a market disruption event with respect to the reference index, in each case as determined by Olden Lane:
�




���


a suspension, absence or limitation of trading in a material number of index constituents in the applicable market or markets for such index constituents;



�




���


a suspension, absence or limitation of trading in option or futures contracts relating to such reference index in the primary market or markets for those contracts;



�




���


any event that disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in general (i) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for a material number of index constituents or (ii) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, futures or options contracts relating to such reference index in the primary market or markets for those options or contracts;



�




���


the early closure of the primary market or markets for (i) a material number of index constituents or (ii) futures or options contracts relating to such reference index; or



�




���


the primary market or markets for (i) a material number of index constituents or (ii) futures or options contracts relating to such reference index fails to open.



�
For this purpose, an �absence of trading� in the primary market on which option or futures contracts related to any reference index or any index constituents are traded will not include any time when that market is itself closed for trading under ordinary circumstances.
�

A-4





� 


�
Discontinuance of, or Adjustments to, the Reference Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation
�
If the index sponsor discontinues publication of the reference index and the index sponsor or any other person or entity publishes a substitute index that Olden Lane determines is comparable to the affected index and approves the substitute index as a successor index, then Olden Lane will determine the closing levels of the reference index, the trigger level, the initial index level, the final index level and the final distributions on the termination date by reference to such successor index.
�
If Olden Lane determines that the publication of the reference index is discontinued and that there is no successor index on any date when the level of such reference index is required to be determined, Olden Lane will instead make the necessary determination by reference to a group of stocks or another index or indices, as applicable, and will apply a computation methodology that Olden Lane determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such reference index.
�
If Olden Lane determines that any index constituents or the method of calculating the reference index have been changed at any time in any respect that causes the level of the reference index not to fairly represent the level of that index had such changes not been made or that otherwise affects the calculation of the closing levels of the reference index, the trigger level, the initial index level, the final index level or the final distributions on the termination date, then Olden Lane may make any adjustments in this method of calculating the reference index that it believes are appropriate to ensure that the index level used to determine the amount payable on the termination date is equitable. Examples of any such changes that may cause Olden Lane to make the foregoing adjustment include, but are not limited to, additions, deletions or substitutions and any reweighting or rebalancing of the index constituents, changes
made by the index sponsor under its existing policies or following a modification of those policies, changes due to the publication of a successor index, changes due to events affecting one or more of the index constituent stocks or their issuers or any other index constituents, as applicable, or changes due to any other reason. All determinations and adjustments to be made with respect to the closing levels of the affected index, the trigger level, the initial index level, the final index level and the final distributions on the termination date or otherwise relating to the level of the affected index will be made by Olden Lane.
�
�THE OPTIONS AGREEMENTS
�
Unwind of Options Agreements on Redemption
�
Upon a redemption of units as described below under �Selling Units�Redemption,� Olden Lane shall cause one or both of the options counterparties to unwind the corresponding number of options agreements. The options agreements provide that the Trust may exercise an unwind on or prior to the close of trading on each business day and that payments will be made to the Trust three business days thereafter. The actual proceeds realized from the unwind of an options agreement may differ from the evaluator�s determination of the fair value of such options agreements which consider various factors such as the amounts payable in connection with an early unwind of such options agreements by the options counterparty or current prices for the options agreements as may be obtained from dealers or brokers and/or prices for comparable options. The value of the Trust will vary over time based principally
on the value of the options agreements and the treasury obligations. The value of the options agreements will be driven by the performance of the reference index, the terms of the options agreements and factors such as market interest rates, the dividend yield of the reference index and the volatility of the reference index. The passage of time will also generally influence the value of the options agreements. The value of the Trust will generally increase when the index level of the reference index rises and decline when the index level of the reference index falls. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments. All valuations in connection with a redemption take into consideration applicable bid and ask spreads.
�
Termination of the Options Agreements Upon Event of Default or Other Events
�
While Olden Lane does not expect them to occur, the options agreements contain provisions providing that the occurrence of certain events may lead to the termination of the options agreements and the Trust:
�


� 


A-5





� 


�
Events of Default. The occurrence of any of the following with respect to an options counterparty or the Trust, as applicable, constitutes an event of default under the affected options agreements by the relevant options counterparty or the Trust, as applicable (the �defaulting party�):
�




1.��


the options counterparty or Trust fails to make, when due, any payment under the relevant options agreement, and such failure is not remedied by the first business day after notice of such failure is given to the options counterparty or Trust, as applicable (such event, a �failure to pay�);



�




2.��


subject to limited exceptions, the options counterparty fails to comply with or perform an obligation or agreement and such failure is not remedied by the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the options counterparty;



�




3.��


failure of the options counterparty or Trust to comply with the collateral arrangement described above under �Principal Investment Strategy�Collateralization of Options Agreements� (such event, a �collateral default�);



�




4.��


subject to limited exceptions, the options counterparty makes or is deemed to make a representation that proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made;



�




5.��


the acceleration or other similar event in respect of the options counterparty under one or more agreements relating to borrowed money which has resulted in a material portion of that debt becoming due and payable (or, if at the termination date, amounts due and payable) (such event, a �cross default�); or



�




6.��


the options counterparty or the Trust is subject to certain insolvency events which, in general, involve events such as dissolutions; general assignments for the benefit of creditors; the institution of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy; passing resolutions for winding-up or liquidation and like-kind events (such event, a �bankruptcy�).



�
Termination Events.��The occurrence of the following with respect to an options counterparty or the Trust constitutes a termination event (an �options termination event�) under the affected options agreements:
�




1.��


it becomes unlawful for the options counterparty or the Trust (which will be the �affected party�) to comply with any material provision of the options agreements as a result of legislative, regulatory or judicial action, (such event, an �illegality�);



�




2.��


due to a change in tax law, the options counterparty or Trust (which will be the �affected party�) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next distribution date under the options agreements be required to pay to the other party an additional tax amount or receive a payment from which a tax amount is required to be deducted or withheld (such event, a �tax event�);



�




3.��


in the case of the options counterparty (which will be the �affected party�), the Trust (which will be the �burdened party�) on the next distribution date under the options agreements is required to pay to the other party an additional tax amount or receive a payment from which a tax amount is required to be deducted or withheld in either case as a result of the options counterparty merging with another entity (such event, a �tax event upon merger�); or



�




4.��


with respect to each options counterparty, all of the options agreements are terminated between the other options counterparty and the Trust due to an event of default or termination�event�(where the Trust will be the �affected party�).



�
Early Termination Dates and Trust Termination Resulting From an Early Termination Date under the Options Agreements. Upon the occurance of any event of default under an options agreement for which the relevant options counterparty is the defaulting party, a tax event for which the Trust is the affected party, a tax event upon merger or an illegality for which the Trust or an options counterparty is the affected party (such events, �options counterparty events�), Olden Lane may (and at the direction of the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding units shall) designate an early termination date at the earliest date following Olden Lane�s receipt of actual knowledge of that event.
�
If any of the following events occurs: a failure to pay, a collateral default or a bankruptcy for which the Trust is the defaulting party or a tax event for which the options counterparty is the affected party, or an illegality for which either the Trust or options counterparty is the affected party (such events, �trust options events�), the relevant options counterparty may designate an early termination date by giving notice to Olden Lane. In the case where there is a termination event as described in item 4 of the �Termination Events� section above,


� 


A-6





� 


�
the other relevant options counterparty will designate an early termination date by providing notice to Olden Lane.
�
In the event that either the Trust or an options counterparty designates an early termination date, Olden Lane will commence selling all treasury obligations to fund any payments owed to the options counterparties and the payment of any remaining Trust expenses. Olden Lane will demand payment of any amounts owed by the options counterparties under their respective options agreements, and if such payments are not made, liquidate any collateral posted by the options counterparties to the Trust to secure these payments. Similarly, the options counterparties will demand payment of any amounts owed by the Trust, and if such payments are not made, liquidate any collateral posted by the Trust to the options counterparty to secure these payments. The termination date of the Trust shall also be accelerated to the date determined by Olden Lane based on receipt of the final liquidation proceeds of the treasury obligations and the final
payment under the options agreements and the payment of Trust expenses, and the Trust will distribute the balance of Trust property to unitholders.
�
Determination of Termination Payment Under the Options Agreements
�
Should Olden Lane terminate an options agreement after an options counterparty event occurs, Olden Lane will compute an amount payable under the affected options agreements by reference to the �market quotation� method.��Generally, the �market quotation� method involves the computation of an amount payable by or to the Trust based on the solicitation of eligible replacement options counterparties of an amount that would be paid to or by the Trust for replacement options transactions having the effect of preserving for the Trust the economic equivalent of the terminated options agreements as of the date of the early termination.
�
The Trust is structured so that the termination of an options agreement due to a trust options event is unlikely. However, should such a trust options event occur, the determination of market quotation will generally parallel the determination above, except that, in general, the relevant options counterparty will make the �market quotation� computation from its replacement cost perspective rather than from the Trust�s replacement cost perspective.
�
Payment upon the early termination of any options agreement could result in substantial losses to the unitholders. Because the evaluator employs fair value to price the options agreements, the price used by the evaluator may be materially different from the prices of similar option contracts listed on an exchange, and may differ from the price that may be realized upon the actual disposition of the options agreements. In addition to such risks, if an options counterparty owes an amount to the Trust under its options agreement and the collateral posted by such options counterparty is insufficient to cover that amount, the Trust also faces the risk of non-performance by the options counterparty. As a result, the credit risk to any uncollateralized obligation of the options counterparties may result in significant losses.
�
Dissolution of the Trust.
�
In addition to the events specified in Part B of this prospectus under �Trust Administration - Dissolution of the Trust�, Olden Lane may direct the dissolution of the Trust if due to�a change in law (including tax law) there is, or there is a substantial likelihood that the Trust will be prohibited or impaired in any material way from pursuing its principal investment strategy. In addition, if a default, termination event or similar event in respect of the Trust occurs and the derivative counterparties direct the termination of the options agreements, Olden Lane will direct the dissolution of the Trust.
�
�HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES
�
The following table illustrates hypothetical returns for the units based on mathematical principles and the following assumptions and definitions:
�




���


The units are assumed to be held from the inception date to the termination date.



�




���


The "Hypothetical Index Returns" are for illustrative purposes only. Other index returns are possible and would result in different outcomes.



�


� 


A-7





� 


�




���


The "Payment on Option Agreement per Unit" are computations based on the hypothetical index returns and the formulae discussed under "Principal Investment Strategy�General�Options Agreements" above and assume a participation rate of 100%, a trigger level of 80% of the initial index level and a maximum gain of 20%. The actual participation rate, trigger level and maximum gain will each be set at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the inception date. Negative amounts indicate a payment to be made by the Trust and positive amounts indicate a payment to be received by the Trust.



�




���


The �Maturity Value of Treasury Obligations per Unit� is the "Principal Amount of Treasury Obligations per Unit at Inception" set forth below in "Essential Information.�



�




���


The �Aggregate Interest Income from Treasury Obligations per Unit (over Trust�s Life)� represents the sum of the scheduled interest payments on the treasury obligations that are anticipated to be received by the Trust over its scheduled three-year life and are assumed to equal $26 per unit.��While interest income is expected to be distributed to unitholders semi-annually, such distributions have been aggregated in this presentation for ease of use. As a result, the presentation does not fully account for the timing of income and time value of money effects.



�




���


The "Aggregate Estimated Trust Expenses per Unit" are assumed to be $7 payable over the term of the Trust.��For ease of use, this presentation does not address the timing of these expenses and their full time value of money effects.



�




���


The actual aggregate interest income from the treasury obligations is expected to exceed the expenses of the Trust. If Trust expenses exceed interest received, Olden Lane may be required to sell treasury obligations to meet such expenses and the "Maturity Value of Treasury Obligations per Unit" will be less than is illustrated below.



�




���


The �Hypothetical Final Distribution per Unit Upon Termination of the Trust� represents the sum of the �Payment on Option Agreement per Unit,� the �Maturity Value of Treasury Obligations per Unit� and the �Aggregate Interest Income from Treasury Obligations per Unit�, less the �Aggregate Estimated Trust Expenses per Unit.�



�




���


The "Hypothetical Return per Unit" is the hypothetical gain or loss on an investment in a unit based on the "Hypothetical Distribution per Unit Upon Termination of the Trust" and an assumed purchase price of $[1,030] per unit. The $[1,030] purchase price per unit includes a maximum sales charge of $30 per unit. A higher purchase price would result in a lesser gain or a greater loss than illustrated below.



�




���


The presentation does not predict or project the performance of the Trust units, the Trust or the Trust's investment strategy. All amounts are rounded for ease of use.



�




���


The "Hypothetical Return per Unit" does��not consider taxes paid by a unitholder.

�REFERENCE INDEX
�
We have derived all information regarding the reference index contained in this prospectus, including, without limitation, its make-up, method of calculation and changes in its components, from publicly available information. Olden Lane has not conducted any independent review or due diligence of any publicly available information with respect to the reference index and assumes no responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of information about the reference index. You should make your own investigation into the reference index.
�
The S&P 500� Index
�
General
�
All information regarding the reference index set forth in this prospectus reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together, with the S&P Index Committee, the �index sponsor�). The reference index is maintained by the S&P Index Committee, a team of S&P Dow Jones Indices economists and index analysts who meet on a monthly basis. The reference index is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of stock price movement. The daily calculation of the level of the reference index, discussed below in further detail, is based on the aggregate market value of the index constituents compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943. The reference index does not reflect the payment of dividends on index constituents.
Because of this the return on the Trust will not be the same as the return you would receive if you were to purchase the index constituents and hold them for a period equal to the term of the Trust.
�
Composition of the Reference Index
�
The index sponsor chooses companies for inclusion in the reference index with the aim of achieving a distribution by broad industry groupings that approximates the distribution of these groupings in the common stock population of its database, which the index sponsor uses as an assumed model for the composition of the total market. Generally, only one class of common stock of any company is included in the reference index. The common stock of a company included in the reference index is usually the most liquid class of common stock of that company as determined by the index sponsor in its sole discretion.��Relevant criteria employed by the index sponsor for new additions include the viability of the particular company, the extent to which that company represents the industry group to which it is assigned, the extent to which the market value of that company's common stock is generally responsive to changes in the affairs of
the respective industry and the market price and trading activity of the common stock of that company. The ten main groups of companies that comprise the reference index include: Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, Health Care, Industrials, Information Technology, Materials, Telecommunication Services and Utilities. The index sponsor may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add companies to, or delete companies from, the reference index to achieve the objectives stated above.
�
Additional information on the reference index and the index methodology for the reference index is made available by the index sponsor at http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500.� The information on this website is not part of or incorporated by reference in this prospectus.
�
License Agreement
�
The Trust has entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the index sponsor whereby the Trust, in exchange for a fee, is permitted to use the reference index. None of the Trust, Olden Lane or its affiliates are affiliated with the index sponsor; the only relationship between the index sponsor and such entity is any licensing of the use of the index sponsor's indices and trademarks relating to them.

The Trust is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by the index sponsor. The index sponsor makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the unitholders or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in securities generally or in this Trust particularly, or the ability of the reference index to track general stock market performance. The index sponsor's only relationship to the Trust is the licensing of certain trademarks and trade names of the index sponsor and of the reference index which is determined, composed and calculated by the index sponsor without regard to the Trust, its affiliates or the unitholders. The index sponsor has no obligation to take the needs of the Trust or the unitholders into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the reference index. The index sponsor is not responsible for and has not participated in the determination of the timing of, prices
at, or quantities of the units to be issued or in the determination or calculation of the equation by which the Trust�s portfolio is to be converted into cash. The index sponsor has no obligation or liability in connection with the administration, marketing or trading of the Trust.
�
The index sponsor does not guarantee the accuracy and/or the completeness of the reference index or any data included therein and it shall have no liability for any errors, omissions or interruptions therein. The index sponsor makes no warranty, express or implied, as to results to be obtained by the Trust, unitholders, or any other person or entity from the use of the reference index or any data included therein. The index sponsor makes no express or implied warranties, and expressly disclaims all warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use with respect to the reference index or any data included therein. Without limiting any of the foregoing, in no event shall the index sponsor have any liability for any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages (including lost profits), even if notified of the possibility of such damages.

Historical Performance of the S&P 500��Index

�
The following graph sets forth the daily closing levels of the reference index from January 3, 2000 through March 13, 2015. We obtained the reference index closing levels below from Bloomberg Professional� service (�Bloomberg�) without independent verification. We make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg. The historical levels of the reference index are provided for informational purposes only. You should not take the historical levels of the reference index as an indication of future performance, which may be better or worse than the levels set forth below. The closing level of the reference index on March 13, 2015 was 2,053.40.

Historical Reference Index Levels
�
The following table shows the quarterly performance of the reference index for all four calendar quarters in each of 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Partial information is provided for the first calendar quarter of 2015. All prices and levels used to calculate the performance of the reference index are based on quotations obtained from Bloomberg.��The closing levels may be adjusted by Bloomberg for corporate actions such as stock splits, public offerings, mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, extraordinary dividends, delistings and bankruptcy. The historical level of the reference index should not be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be given as to the index level on any given day.

Investment in units may not be suitable if:


� 
� 
� 
� 
� 


♦������You fully understand the risks inherent in an investment in the units, including the risk of loss of almost all of your initial investment.
�
♦������You can tolerate a loss of some or almost all of your investment and are willing to make an investment that has downside market risk similar to an investment in the reference index subject to the trigger level.
�
♦������You believe the level of the reference index will appreciate over the term of the units and that the percentage of appreciation is unlikely to exceed the maximum gain of [●]%.
�
♦������You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Trust prior to the termination date that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the level of the reference index.
�
♦������You plan to hold the Trust to the termination date.


♦������You do not fully understand the risks inherent in an investment in the Trust, including the risk of loss of almost all of your initial investment.
�
♦������You require an investment designed to provide a full return of your initial investment.
�
♦������You are not willing to make an investment that has downside market risk similar to an investment in the reference index subject to the trigger level.
�
♦������You believe that the level of the reference index will decline during the term of the Trust and that the decline from the initial index level to the final index level is likely to be greater than the trigger level, or you believe that the level of the reference index will appreciate over the term of the Trust and that the percentage of appreciation will exceed the maximum gain of [●]%.
�
♦������You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the units prior to the termination date that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the level of the reference index.
�
♦������You seek current income from your units beyond the modest semi-annual distributions of interest income available from the Trust�s investment in the treasury obligations and are not willing to forego any dividends paid on the reference index.
�
♦������You are unwilling or do not plan to hold units of the Trust to the termination date.




�
The suitability considerations identified above are not exhaustive.��Whether or not Units are a suitable investment will depend on individual circumstances and you should reach an investment decision only after you and your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors have carefully considered the suitability of an investment in light of your particular circumstances.��You should also review carefully the �Principal Risks� beginning on page A-13 of this prospectus Part A as well as the �Investment Risks� section of prospectus Part B for risks related to an investment in the Trust.



� 


A-12





� 


�
�PRINCIPAL RISKS
�
As with all investments, you may lose some or all of your investment in the Trust. This section describes the main risks that can impact the value of units of the Trust. You should understand these risks before you invest and should reach a decision to invest in the Trust only after carefully considering the suitability of such an investment in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this prospectus. We urge you to read the additional explanation of risks relating to the units generally in the "Investment Risks" section of Part B of this prospectus. We also urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the units.
�
Olden Lane makes no recommendation as to the suitability of the units for investment.��If the value of the assets in the Trust�s portfolio falls, the value of your units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that the Trust will achieve its objective or that a unitholder�s investment return will be positive over any period.
�
The Trust is not actively managed. The Trust is a unit investment trust and, as a result, is not actively managed. Trust property is only bought and sold in limited circumstances as described in this prospectus.��The Trust will generally hold, and may continue to buy, the same assets even though the market value or yield on such assets may have changed. The value of your investment may fall over time.
�
Market Risk.��Market risk is the risk that the value of the assets in the Trust�s portfolio will fluctuate.��This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price.��Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in the performance and expected volatility of the reference index, its various constituents, interest rates and inflation.��In addition, the value of the Trust might be affected by (i) the dividend rates on the index constituents, (ii) interest and yield rates on the treasury obligations and in the market generally and (iii) a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events.��The Trust does not guarantee any return of principal.
�
Risk of Loss. The return on your units on the termination date is linked to the performance of the reference index and will depend on whether, and the extent to which, the performance of the reference index is positive or negative.��On the termination date, should the final index level be less than the trigger level, you will likely suffer substantial losses on your initial investment.� The downside market exposure to the reference index is subject to contingent protection only on the termination date. The [$200] per unit minimum distribution feature applies only on the termination date. All expected payments are subject to further reductions for expenses.
�
Options Risk. �Options agreements are derivative contracts that are based on, and are valued in relation to, one or more underlying securities, financial benchmarks or indices. Derivatives typically have economic leverage inherent in their terms. Such leverage will magnify any losses. Options agreements can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value, and changes in the value of such instruments held by the Trust may not correlate with the underlying reference index, or other Trust property. Although the value of Trust�s options agreements will depend largely upon price movements in the underlying reference index, there are additional risks associated with options agreements that are possibly greater than the risks associated with investing in other financial instruments that provide economic
exposure to the reference index, including illiquidity risk, leveraging risk and counterparty credit risk. A small position in options agreements could have a potentially large impact on the Trust�s performance. Trading restrictions or limitations may be imposed by an exchange, and government regulations may restrict trading in options agreements.
�
The final distribution applies only if units are held to the termination date. Unitholders should plan to hold units to the termination date. If a unitholder redeems or is otherwise able to sell units prior to the termination date in the secondary market, such a sale may be at a loss relative to the initial investment even if any percentage decline of the reference index from its initial index level is equal to or less than the trigger level.
�
The participation rate applies only if units are held to the termination date. Unitholders should plan to hold units to the termination date. If a unitholder redeems or is otherwise able to sell units prior to the termination date in the secondary market, the price of such a sale will likely not reflect the full economic value of the participation rate and the return a unitholder will realize may be less than the index return multiplied by the participation rate even if the index return is positive. Unitholders can receive the full benefit of the participation rate, only if the units are held to the termination date.
�


� 


A-13





� 


�
The potential return is limited by a maximum gain.� The potential return of the units is limited to the maximum gain. Unitholders will not benefit from any positive return of the reference index in excess of an amount that, when multiplied by the participation rate, exceeds the maximum gain. As a result, a unitholder�s��return may be less than a direct investment in the reference index.


Sale of Trust Property to Pay Trust Expenses.��Semi-annual distributions of interest income from the Trust�s investment in the treasury obligations on the securities may be insufficient to meet any or all expenses of the Trust.��If the cash balances in the income and capital accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts payable by the Trust, Olden Lane, on behalf of the Trust, will sell Trust property to pay such amounts.��Sales may result in losses to unitholders and will reduce the principal amount of treasury obligations per unit available on the termination date.
�
Counterparty Concentration Risk. �The Trust is considered to be concentrated in the treasury obligations, options agreements and its exposure to the options counterparties, which are both companies in the financial services industry. Negative developments in the financial services industry may affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
�
Options Counterparty Risk.��The Trust�s ability to achieve its investment objective will depend upon the ability of each options counterparty to meet its obligations. An options counterparty may become unable to make a payment due to the Trust in connection with its options agreement.��Moreover, if an options counterparty is unable to make a payment when due and the collateral posted by the options counterparty is insufficient, the Trust will face the risk of non-performance by the options counterparty and will suffer losses. Olden Lane and the supervisor intend to monitor the collateral accounts and for the occurrence of events which would adversely affect the general credit standing of the options counterparties. Unitholders should understand that the Trust�s portfolio is not actively managed and the Trust may continue to hold the options agreements even if these events occur. As a result, the credit
risk of the options counterparties may affect the value of your investment and may result in significant losses.
�
Higher Purchase Price Risk.� The final distributions on the termination date (or otherwise, on redemption) will not be adjusted based on the price you pay for your units. If you purchase units at a price other than $[1,030], then the return on your investment will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on a unit purchased at $[1,030]. If you purchase a unit at more than $[1,030] and hold the unit to the termination date, the return on your investment (or loss thereon) will be lower than it would have been for a unit purchased at $[1,030]. In addition, the impact of the trigger level on the return on your investment, and the extent to which the trigger level will diminish your exposure to any negative reference index performance, will depend upon the price you pay for your units relative to a unit purchased at $[1,030].
�
Dilution Risk.��As Olden Lane sells units, the size of the Trust will increase. Olden Lane will seek to replicate the existing portfolio and when the Trust buys treasury obligations and options agreements, it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees. Existing unitholders could experience a dilution of their investment because of these fees and fluctuations in prices between the time Olden Lane creates units and the time the Trust buys Trust property. Unitholders could also experience dilution because of similar fees paid and fluctuations in the prices between the time that Olden Lane redeems units and sells or unwinds Trust property. Olden Lane cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size for any length of time.
�
Dividend and Voting Risk. Unitholders will not have control, voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of a direct investment in the index constituents or options agreements would normally have.��The reference index does not reflect the payment of dividends on the stocks included in the reference index. Because of this the return on the units will not be the same as the return you would receive if you were to purchase those stocks and hold them for a period equal to the term of the Trust.��Furthermore, a direct investment in the index constituents is likely to have tax consequences that are different from an investment in the Trust.
�
Treasury Obligation Risk.��No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future. �Treasury obligations are direct obligations of the United States that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. �The value of the treasury obligations will be adversely affected by decreases in bond prices and increases in interest rates. �Certain treasury obligations may have been purchased at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the Trust�s inception date at prices lower than their par 
�

� 


�
value at maturity, indicating a market discount. �Certain treasury obligations may have been purchased at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the Trust�s inception date at prices greater than their par value at maturity, indicating a market premium. �Generally, the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease. �Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium.��Given today�s historically low interest rate environment, risks associated with rising rates are heightened.
�
Legislation and Litigation Risk. From time to time, various legislative initiatives are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the index constituents.��Such an initiative may also have a negative impact on the Trust�s portfolio, or on the tax treatment of your investment in the Trust. In addition, litigation regarding any of the issuers of the index constituents or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities and, therefore, the level of the reference index. No one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of any of the index constituents and what the overall affect may be on the value of the Trust.
�
Liquidity Risk.��A unitholder may be subject to liquidity risk if Olden Lane does not maintain a secondary market; however, a unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market may cause units to be redeemed on any business day by the Trust. The Trust may exercise an unwind right provided under the options agreements in connection with a redemption. Because the evaluator employs fair value to price the options agreements, the price used by the evaluator may be materially different from the prices of similar option contracts listed on an exchange, and may differ from the price that may be realized upon the actual disposition of the options agreements.
�
No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
�
Reference Index Risk.��The return on the Trust is expected to depend largely upon the performance of the reference index which consists of 500 stocks selected to provide a performance benchmark for the U.S. equity markets.��The policies of the index sponsor and any changes affecting the reference index or the index constituents could affect the market value of the Trust and its units.��The policies of the index sponsor concerning the calculation of the levels of the reference index or additions, deletions or substitutions of the index constituents and the manner in which changes affecting such index constituents or their issuers, such as stock dividends, reorganizations or mergers, are reflected in the level of the reference index, could affect the levels of the reference index and, therefore, the amount payable in respect of units of the Trust on the termination date and the market value of the Trust
and its units prior to the termination date. The market value of the Trust and its units could also be affected if the index sponsor changes these policies, for example, by changing the manner in which it calculates the level of the reference index, or if the index sponsor discontinues or suspends calculation or publication of the level of the reference index, in which case it may become difficult to determine the market value of the Trust and its units.��Unitholders will have no rights against the index sponsor, even if the index sponsor decides to suspend the calculation of the reference index and this suspension adversely impacts the amount unitholders receive on the termination date.
�
Investing in the Trust is not the same as investing in the reference index or the index constituents.��The return to a unitholder holding units of the Trust to the termination date will be based in part on the performance of the reference index and whether the final index level is greater than, equal to or less than the trigger level. The return on the investment in the Trust may not reflect the return available to an investor who invested directly in the reference index or the index constituents.
�
Potential conflict of interest.��There are also potential conflicts of interest between the unitholders and the evaluator and supervisor, which, in each case, will be an affiliate of Olden Lane. The evaluator will determine the value of Trust property and, therefore, the index return and the final distribution amount per unit. The evaluator can postpone the determination of the initial level and/or trigger level on the inception date and the final index level on the termination date, if a market disruption event occurs and is continuing on that day, and may make adjustments to the initial index level, final index level, trigger level and the reference index itself for a discontinuation or a change in its underlying index constituents or the method of its calculation. As Olden Lane or its affiliates determines the economic terms of the Trust, including the participation rate and
trigger level, the Trust represents a package of economic terms.
�

Uncertain Tax Treatment.�Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the units are uncertain. You should read carefully the sections entitled "Tax Status" in Part B of this prospectus and consult your tax advisor about your tax situation.

(1)


Based on a unit with a $[●] per unit public offering price (net of the maximum sales fee) on the inception date.



(2)


The transactional sales fee provided above is based on the public offering price on the inception date. Because the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the creation and development fee (as described below), the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price varies. Despite the variability of the transactional sales fee, each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee. Olden Lane will reallow [●] of the transactional sales fee to distribution firms engaged in selling the units.



(3)


The creation and development fee compensates Olden Lane for creating and developing the Trust. The actual creation and development fee is $[●] per unit and is paid to Olden Lane on the sales date for each unit during the initial offering period. The percentages provided are based on a public offering price of $[●] per unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time. If the public offering price exceeds $[●] per unit, the creation and development fee will be less than [●]% of the public offering price; if the public offering price is less than $[●] per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed [●]% of the public offering price. However, in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed [●]% of a unitholder�s initial investment.



(4)


The estimated organization costs will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. Estimated organization costs are assessed on a fixed dollar amount per unit basis, which as a percentage of average net assets, will vary over time. Estimated organization costs include [a licensing fee paid to the index sponsor for the use of intellectual property owned by the index sponsor and] the Trustee�s fee.



(5)


Subject to $[●] minimum fee per annum.



(6)


The estimated Trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated Trust size of approximately $[●]. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the Trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life, the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected. In some cases, the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected. Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees.

��
EXAMPLE
�
This example helps you compare the cost of this Trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the Trust�s operating expenses do not change. Your actual returns and expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every $10,000 you invest in the Trust:






1 year


[●]



2 year


[●]



3 year


[●]



�
These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment. The example does not consider any transaction fees paid by the Trust or that broker-dealers may charge for processing redemption requests.
�
�TAXES
�
The Trust has elected and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a regulated investment company (�RIC�) under Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the �Code�).��Income and capital gain distributions you receive from the Trust generally are subject to federal income taxes and may also be subject to state and local taxes.��The Trust intends to distribute, at least annually, substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. However, as described under �Distributions� above, unitholders should not expect to receive significant current income from the Trust.��See �Tax Status� in Part B of the prospectus for further tax information.
�
�DISTRIBUTIONS
�
The units are expected to pay semi-annual distributions of interest income from the Trust until the termination date (which will be the last distribution date).��All interest received by the Trust from the treasury obligations and cash will be used for the payment of Trust expenses with the remaining interest income after the payment of such expenses being distributed as described above.��With respect to such distributions, unitholders of record on the preceding record date will receive distributions in cash.
�
Each unit of the Trust at the inception date represents the undivided beneficial interest in the underlying securities and options agreements set forth in the �Cap Trigger Performance Portfolio Linked to the S&P 500� Index� and net income of the Trust.
�
Reports. [●], as transfer agent for the Trust, or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income, receipts and distributions for that year. After the close of each year the Trust�s transfer agent will also make available an annual report on the Trust�s activity and certain tax information. You may request 
�


� 


A-18





� 


�
copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for the Trust, if available.
�
�PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF UNITS
�
You may purchase or redeem units of the Trust on any business day through your financial advisor or other financial intermediary. Your financial intermediary can either redeem units through the transfer agent or sell units back to Olden Lane as described below.��With respect to the selling of units, a unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market as described above may cause its financial intermediary to redeem units by making a written request in proper form to the transfer agent at its unit investment trust office in [●] no later than 3:00 p.m. on a business day to receive the redemption price for that business day. Requests in proper form received after that cut-off time will be deemed effective the following business day.��See �Purchasing Units� and �Selling Units� in Part B of the prospectus for more information.
�
Olden Lane may but is under no obligation to repurchase units from unitholders who want to redeem their units. These repurchases will be at the redemption price. Olden Lane is not obligated to maintain a market and may stop doing so without prior notice for any reason. If Olden Lane stops repurchasing units, a unitholder�s financial intermediary may dispose of units by redemption through [●], which serves as the transfer agent. The price received from the Trust by the unitholder for units being redeemed is generally based upon the sales price of the related Trust property.
�
Until the end of the initial offering period, the price at which the Trust will redeem units and the price at which Olden Lane may repurchase units generally includes estimated organization costs. After such period, the amount paid will not include such estimated organization costs.

Each option agreement relates to a quantity of the reference index equal to $1,000 divided by the initial index level, or [1,000/XXXX]. We will refer to this quantity as an �index unit.� As of the inception date, one index unit equals $1,000 invested in the reference index on the inception date and as of each business day thereafter one index unit will have a value as set forth in �Selling Units�Redemption�Computation of Redemption Price� in Part B of this prospectus. The Trust shall initially enter into an equal number of options agreements with each options counterparty in order to obtain a ratio of one option agreement per counterparty for each outstanding unit.

The value of treasury obligations is based on the current ask side evaluation at the opening of business on the inception date.��Olden Lane Advisors LLC is the evaluator of the Trust.��Capelogic, Inc., an independent pricing service, determined the initial prices of the Trust property comprising the portfolio at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day before the inception date. The value of the options agreements is based on the good faith determination of the fair value of the options agreements taking into consideration factors, including, but not limited to (a) the net amount to be paid or received by the Trust in connection with an early termination of the options agreements as determined by the options counterparty and/or an independent third party pricing service on the relevant valuation date, (b) current ask prices for the options agreements as obtained from investment dealers
or brokers who customarily deal in options comparable to the options agreements held by the Trust and (c) ask prices for comparable options or securities, each as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the inception date.��The evaluator retains the discretion to bifurcate the options agreement and use the bid side evaluation for any portion of the options agreements determined that the Trust is �short.���Accounting

Standards Codification 820, �Fair Value Measurements� establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements in financial statements for the Trust.��The framework under the standard is comprised of a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.��The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:



�

Level 1:��Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Trust has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
�
Level 2:��Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
�
Level 3:��Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Trust's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
�
The inputs or methodologies used for valuing Trust property are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in such property.��Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an investment's assigned level as described above.

The treasury obligations are represented by contracts to purchase such securities the performance of which is secured by cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. Contracts to acquire these securities were entered into on [●], 2015, and have an expected settlement date of [●], 2015. �All or a portion of the treasury obligations may be pledged as collateral in order to secure the Trust�s obligation to pay amounts payable by the Trust under the options agreements.

Unitholders
Olden Lane Trust Series 1 (the �Trust�)
�
We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the Trust portfolio set forth on page A-20 of this prospectus, of the Trust, as of [●], 2015, the inception date. The statement of financial condition is the responsibility of the Trust�s depositor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our audit.
�
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust�s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by Olden Lane, as well as evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with [●], the Trust�s Custodian, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of financial condition as of [●], 2015. We believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
�
In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust, as of [●], 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

OLDEN LANE TRUST
�
Prospectus Part B
�
Dated [●], 2015
�
The prospectus for each series of the Olden Lane Trust (each such series, a "Trust") is divided into two parts. Part A of the prospectus relates exclusively to a particular Trust and provides specific information regarding that Trust's portfolio, strategies, investment objectives, expenses, financial highlights, income and capital distributions, hypothetical performance information, risk factors and optional features. Part B of the prospectus provides more general information regarding the Trusts. You should read both parts of the prospectus and retain them for future reference. Except as provided in Part A of the prospectus, the information contained in this Part B will apply to each Trust.
�
�ORGANIZATION
�
The Trust is a newly established, separate series of Olden Lane Trust.��Olden Lane Trust is a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 10, 2015 by a Master Trust Agreement (the �Master Trust Agreement�) between Olden Lane Securities LLC (�Olden Lane�), as depositor, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. Each separate series created within Olden Lane Trust is governed by the Master Trust Agreement and a respective Series Supplement to the Master Trust Agreement (together, the �Trust Agreement�).��The Series Supplement for a Trust is dated as of the inception date for that Trust. The value of the securities and other property comprising the Trust�s portfolio (the �Trust
property�) is determined on each business day by the evaluator as discussed under �Selling Units�Redemption�Computation of Redemption Price.� Following the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding the inception date, Olden Lane delivered securities or other property, contracts and/or funds (represented by cash�or a certified check(s) and/or an irrevocable letter(s) of credit issued by a major commercial bank) for the purchase of certain securities to the Trust�s Custodian (as defined below) or, to the extent applicable, otherwise executed and delivered on behalf of the Trust certain derivatives agreements. After the delivery of the securities and/or other property and, if applicable, execution and delivery of any derivatives agreements and the creation of the Trust,
the Trust�s transfer agent delivered to Olden Lane the units (the �units�) comprising the ownership of the Trust. These units are now being offered pursuant to this prospectus.
�
[●] (the �Custodian�), a banking corporation organized under the laws of [●], performs services for the Trust as custodian, transfer agent and administrator. Olden Lane Advisors LLC acts as evaluator and supervisor and Olden Lane acts as depositor, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement and a respective series supplement to the Master Services Agreement relating to each Trust among Olden Lane Trust, Olden Lane, Olden Lane Advisors LLC and the Custodian (together, the �Services Agreement�).
�
Unless otherwise indicated, references to �Olden Lane,� �we,� �our,� and �us� refer to Olden Lane only and not to its affiliated entities. References to �you� and �your� refer to the unitholder, which refers to those own units registered in each holder�s name on the books that the Trust�s transfer agent maintains for this purpose.
�
�UNITS
�
Each unit represents an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed or until the termination of the Trust Agreement for the Trust.
�
�PURCHASING UNITS
�
Public Offering Price.�You can buy units of the Trust on any business day during the initial offering period by contacting your financial professional. The public offering price includes: the aggregate net underlying value of the Trust property plus any accrued interest, organization costs, the maximum sales fee (which includes a transactional sales fee and the creation and development fee), and cash and other net assets in the portfolio. Olden Lane refers to the purchase price of units as the �public offering price.�
�


� 


B-1





� 


�
At the end of the initial offering period, the public offering price of the units will no longer include a pro rata portion of estimated organizational costs.
�
The evaluator determined the initial prices of the Trust property shown in �Olden Lane Trust Portfolio �Portfolio Composition� in Part A of this prospectus. On the first day Olden Lane sells units, it will compute the public offering price as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective, if later. On or after the inception date, such�determinations are made each business day during the initial public offering period as of the evaluation time set forth in �Essential Information,� effective for all sales made subsequent to the last preceding determination. For information relating to the calculation of the redemption price which is determined on each business day by the evaluator at the evaluation time, see �Selling Units�Redemption�Computation
of Redemption Price� below.
�
Organization Costs.�During the initial offering period, a portion of the public offering price includes an amount of securities or cash to pay for all or a part of the costs incurred in establishing the Trust (�organization costs�). These organization costs include the cost of preparing the registration statement, the Trust Agreement, the Services Agreement and other documents related to the Trust and Trust property, registering units with the securities regulators, commodities regulators and state blue sky fees, the initial audit and valuation of the Trust portfolio, fees paid to a portfolio consultant for assisting Olden Lane in selecting the Trust�s portfolio, if any, licensing fees paid for the use of intellectual property, if any, and the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Custodian and legal and other out-of-pocket expenses related thereto.��Organization
costs will not include the expenses incurred in the printing of preliminary prospectuses and prospectuses, expenses incurred in the preparation and printing of brochures and other advertising materials and any other selling expenses. Organization costs will be deducted from the Trust at the earlier of six months after the business day immediately preceding the inception date or the end of the initial offering period. The Trust may use distributions from the Trust property or otherwise may sell securities, or otherwise dispose of Trust property to reimburse Olden Lane for these costs. Organization costs will not exceed the estimate set forth under �Fee Table� in Part A of the prospectus.
�
Transactional�Sales Fee. The transactional sales fee is an amount up to a percentage of the public offering price set forth in Part A of the prospectus. This percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the public offering price on the inception date. Because the transactional sales fee is the difference between the maximum sales fee and the creation and development fee, the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price varies. The transactional sales fee does not include the creation and development fee which is described under �Expenses of the Trust� below and �Fee Table� in Part A of the prospectus.
�
Reduction of Transactional Sales Fees. If provided in Part A of the prospectus,�Olden Lane may offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the maximum sales fee you pay. It is your financial professional�s responsibility to alert us of any transactional sales fee discount when you order units. Since the creation and development fee is a fixed dollar amount per unit, the Trust must charge the creation and development fee per unit regardless of any discounts. However, when you purchase units of the Trust, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total maximum sales fee is less than the fixed dollar amount of the creation and development fee, Olden Lane will credit you the difference between your maximum sales fee and the creation and development fee at the time you buy units by providing you with additional units.
�
Advisory and Fee Accounts. Olden Lane may eliminate the transactional sales fee for purchases made through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who charge periodic fees in lieu of commissions or who charge for financial planning or for investment advisory or asset management services or provide these services as part of an investment account where a comprehensive �wrap fee� is imposed (a �fee account�). This discount applies during the initial offering period and is not available unless the applicable investment professional notifies Olden Lane of a particular investor�s eligibility for the discount. Your financial professional may purchase units with the fee account CUSIP numbers to facilitate purchases under this discount. Olden Lane reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of units not subject to the transactional
sales fee by investors whose frequent trading activity Olden Lane determines to be detrimental to the Trust. Olden Lane will receive and you will pay the creation and development fee. See �Expenses of the Trust� below for additional information.
�


� 


B-2





� 


�
Employees.�If provided in Part A of the prospectus, Olden Lane will not charge the portion of the transactional sales fee that it would normally pay to your financial professional for purchases made by officers, directors and employees and their family members (spouses, children under the age of 21 living in the same household, parents and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Olden Lane and its affiliates, or by employees of selling firms and their family members (spouses, children and parents). Such purchases are also subject to the creation and development fee. This discount applies during the initial offering period. Only those broker-dealers that allow their employees to participate in employee discount programs will be eligible for this discount.
�
Dividend Reinvestment Plan. If dividend reinvestment is made available in Part A of the prospectus, Olden Lane does not charge any sales fee when you reinvest distributions from your Trust into additional units of the Trust. This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary market.
�
Distribution of Units. Olden Lane sells units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.��Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from the public offering price.��Olden Lane may reallow all or part of the transactional sales fee you pay to these distribution firms when they sell units.��Certain commercial banks may make units available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion of the transactional sales fee paid by such banks� customers is retained by the banks.��Olden Lane will retain the balance of any transactional sales fee.��For units sold during the initial offering period, the transactional sales fee paid for a given transaction is as provided in Part A of the prospectus.
�
Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker-Dealers. Olden Lane, at its own�expense and out of its own profits, may�provide additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of the Trust and other products sponsored by Olden Lane or one of its affiliates (�Olden Lane products�). This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of Olden Lane products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past sales. A number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these additional amounts. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the level or expected level of sales of Olden Lane products by the intermediary or its agents, the placing of Olden Lane products on a preferred or recommended product list, access to an intermediary�s
personnel, and other factors.
�
Olden Lane makes these payments for marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisers, advertising, sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediary�s representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of Olden Lane�s products. Olden Lane may make such payments to any intermediaries that sell Olden Lane products.
�
Olden Lane may also make certain payments to, or on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.
�
Payments of such additional compensation, some of which may be characterized as �revenue sharing,� may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend an Olden Lane product, including the Trust, over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units.
�
Olden Lane generally registers units for sale in various states in the United States. Olden Lane does not register units for sale in any foreign country. It is your financial professional�s responsibility to ensure that units are registered or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy units in another country. This prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully. Olden Lane may reject any order for units in whole or in part.
�
Olden Lane may gain or lose money when it holds units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in public offering prices. Any such gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price Olden Lane pays for units and the price at which Olden Lane redeems or resells them. Olden Lane may also gain or lose money when it deposits securities or other Trust property to create units in the amounts set forth in the �Trust Portfolio.�
�


� 


B-3





� 


�
Dealers� Profits.�As set forth under �Purchasing Units�Public Offering Price,� the dealers will receive gross commissions equal to the specified percentages of the public offering price of the units. In offering units dealers will also realize profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which they acquire or buy units and the price at which they resell or redeem such units and to the extent they earn sales charges on purchases.
�
Sponsor Profits.�Olden Lane will receive up to the maximum sales fees equal to the percentage of the public offering price of the units described in Part A of the prospectus. In addition, Olden Lane may realize a profit (or sustain a loss) as of the date the Trust is created resulting from the difference between the public offering prices of the securities or other Trust property to Olden Lane and the cost of such securities or other Trust property to the Trust. Olden Lane may realize additional profits or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily market value of the securities or other Trust property. Olden Lane may also receive a customary broker�s fee in connection with the deposit of any derivative agreement into the Trust.��In no event will the broker�s fee exceed regulatory maximums.
�
Market�for Units. After the initial offering period, Olden Lane and certain other broker-dealers may, but are not obligated to, maintain a market for units of the Trust offered hereby and continuously offer to purchase said units at prices, determined by the evaluator, based on the value of the Trust property. The public offering price of any units resold by Olden Lane will be in accord with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to Olden Lane. If Olden Lane or any broker-dealer decides to maintain a secondary market, it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the Trust at any time.
�
�SELLING UNITS
�
You may sell your units on any business day by contacting your financial professional. The sale price of units is often referred to as the �redemption price.� The redemption price is displayed daily on the Internet at [●] and may be available through your financial professional. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit redemptions or sale requests.
�
Until the end of the initial offering period, the price at which the transfer agent will redeem units and the price at which Olden Lane may repurchase units includes a pro rata portion of estimated organization costs.
�
Selling Units. Olden Lane may, but is not obligated to, maintain a secondary market for units. If you want to sell your units, Olden Lane may buy them at the current price which is based on their net asset value. Olden Lane may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price. The secondary market repurchase price is generally the same as the redemption price. Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a secondary market in units. Olden Lane, and any other broker-dealer that maintains a secondary market, may discontinue such secondary market at any time without notice. Even if neither Olden Lane nor any other broker-dealer makes a market, you will be able to redeem your units on any business day for the current redemption price per unit. See �Redemption� below.
�
Redemption.�A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market described above may cause the unitholder�s financial intermediary to redeem units by making a written request to the transfer agent at its unit investment trust office located at [●]. Units may be tendered to the transfer agent for redemption in accordance with the customary practice of Depository Trust Company, on any business day.��In order for you to receive the redemption price for a particular business day when units are to be redeemed, an authorized financial intermediary must submit a redemption request in proper form and deliver the related units properly to the transfer agent prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange or by another cut-off time prescribed in Part A of the prospectus. Please contact your financial intermediary for instructions on how to place redemption requests
in a form acceptable to the transfer agent. If the properly completed request and related units are received by the transfer agent from a financial intermediary after the close of the New York Stock Exchange or the other prescribed cut-off time, if applicable, you will receive the price computed on the business day following the transfer agent�s receipt.
�
Redemption shall be made by the transfer agent no later than the seventh calendar day following the date of tender for redemption (the �redemption date�) by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price multiplied by the number of units being redeemed. The redemption price is determined as set forth below under �Selling Units�
�


� 


B-4





� 


�
Redemption�Computation of Redemption Price,� as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange or by another cut-off time prescribed in Part A of the prospectus on the date of tender. The �date of tender� is deemed to be the date on which a request for redemption of units accompanied by the related units are properly received in good order by the transfer agent.��Any units redeemed shall be canceled and any undivided beneficial interest in the related Trust extinguished. The price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the Trust property at the time of redemption. No redemption fee will be charged by Olden Lane or the Trustee. Certain broker dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed will be canceled by the transfer agent.
�
Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the transfer agent is required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the transfer agent has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder�s tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations, or the unitholder has not furnished the transfer agent with appropriate evidence that such unitholder is not a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.��Any amount so withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a tax return. Under normal circumstances the transfer agent obtains the unitholder�s tax identification number from the unitholder�s financial intermediary. However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption, such unitholder should make sure that the transfer agent has been provided a certified tax identification
number (generally on IRS Form W-9 or an appropriate substitute form) or appropriate evidence that such unitholder is not a United States person (generally on an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to avoid this possible �back-up withholding.� In the event the transfer agent has not been previously provided such information, it must be provided at the time redemption is requested. Any amounts paid on redemption representing unpaid distributions shall be withdrawn from the income account of the Trust to the extent that funds are available for such purpose. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the capital account for the Trust.
�
The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for more than seven calendar days following the day on which tender for redemption is made (1) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of Trust property is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the Trust property in accordance with the Services Agreement; or (3) for such other period as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit. The transfer agent is not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from any such suspension or postponement.
�
The supervisor or Olden Lane is empowered to sell securities or otherwise dispose of Trust property in order to make funds available for redemption. Such sales, if required, could result in a sale of Trust property by Olden Lane at a loss. To the extent Trust property is sold, the size and diversity of the Trust may be reduced.
�
Computation of Redemption Price. The evaluator will determine the redemption price per unit (as well�as the secondary market public offering�price), using the procedure described below. The redemption price per unit is�the pro rata share of each unit in the Trust�determined generally on the basis of (i) the�cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the�process of being collected and (ii) the value�of the Trust property less (a)�amounts representing taxes or other�governmental charges payable out of the�Trust, (b) any amount owing to the Custodian�for its advances and (c) the accrued�expenses of the Trust. Until the end of the initial
offering period,�the redemption price and the secondary�market repurchase price will also include the creation and development fee and a pro rata portion of�estimated organization costs.
�
The evaluator will determine the value (positive or negative) of the Trust property (the �evaluation�).� The evaluator will make the evaluation of securities and other Trust property in the following manner, provided that the evaluator may deem such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation and determine fair value as described under �Any security for which the evaluator cannot obtain a value or for which the evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation�:
�
For common and preferred shares which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ National Market System and traded in the U.S. public equity markets (such shares, �traded equity securities�):
�


� 


B-5





� 


�




(i)��


If the traded equity securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ National Market System and traded in the U.S. public equity markets, the evaluator will make its evaluation based on the official closing price (or in the case of NASDAQ NMS, the NASDAQ official closing price) on the evaluation time on the related exchange, which is the principal market therefor; and



�




(ii)��


if there is no available official closing price for�any traded equity security, the evaluator will make its evaluation based on�the last available bid prices of the securities.



�
For domestic and foreign fixed income securities and publicly listed exchange-traded equity securities for which the evaluator cannot obtain a value as prescribed for in �traded equity securities� described above:
�
The evaluator will make its evaluation based on the following methods:
�




(i)��


on the basis of on the last official closing price on or prior to the evaluation time on the related exchange if the Securities are publicly listed exchange-traded equity securities listed on a non-U.S. exchange;



�




(ii)��


on the basis of bid prices obtained from brokers and dealers for such securities if there is no available closing price;



�




(iii)��


if there is no available bid price, on the basis of bid prices obtained from independent pricing services for such securities, based on either information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to securities with similar characteristics; and



�




(iv)��


if there is no available independent pricing service, on the basis of bid prices obtained from brokers and dealers for comparable securities, provided however, short-term investments having a maturity of 60 days or less are generally valued at amortized cost; however, securities with a demand feature exercisable by the seller within seven days are generally valued at par.



�
Any security for which the evaluator cannot obtain a value or for which the evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation:
�
Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the evaluator.� These fair value prices generally are calculated based upon where similar securities are trading in the market and may be priced based upon a pricing model and documentation pertaining to the securities.
�
Derivative Transactions. In the event that Part A of the prospectus provides that the Trust property consists of derivatives transactions, (i) if options or futures positions held by the Trust are exchange traded, those options and futures positions will be valued based on the last official closing price on or prior to the evaluation time on the primary exchange for such position provided that there is an operating market-clearing mechanism at the relevant time of determination, or if none, on the last available bid price prior to the evaluation time; (ii) if the derivative transaction is not traded on an exchange, the evaluator will determine the value of such derivative transaction based on its good faith determination of its fair value in its reasonable discretion taking into consideration factors, including, but not limited to, (a) the net amount to be paid to or received by the Trust in connection
with an early termination of such derivative transaction on the relevant date by the related counterparty or any third party pricing service retained by the evaluator, (b) current prices for the derivative transaction as obtained from investment dealers or brokers who customarily deal in financial instruments comparable to the derivative transaction and/or (c) prices for comparable futures contracts, options or securities.
�
Offering Period Evaluations.�Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the initial offering period of units, the valuation of (i) securities will be made on the basis of current ask prices, provided that the official closing price shall 
�


� 


B-6





� 


�
be used to the extent that Olden Lane can purchase or sell at the applicable official price at the evaluation time, (ii) derivative transactions will be made on the basis of current ask prices when the Trust�s investment in the derivative transaction results is a �long��position and (iii) derivative transactions will be made on the basis of current bid prices when the Trust investment in the derivative transaction results is a �short��position.��The evaluator may bifurcate derivative transactions having both long and short components for these purposes.
�
Olden Lane may employ an independent pricing service to determine the initial prices of trust property at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day prior to the inception date.
�
Purchase by Olden Lane of Units Tendered for Redemption. The Services�Agreement requires that the transfer agent notify�Olden Lane of any tender of units for�redemption. Olden Lane, prior to the transfer agent�s close of business on the date of tender, may purchase any units�tendered to the transfer agent for redemption at the�redemption price by making payment�therefore to the unitholder in an amount not�less than the redemption price on the date of�tender not later than the day that would have been the redemption date for the�units had such units otherwise been redeemed�(see �Selling Units�Redemption�). Units held by Olden Lane�may
be tendered to the transfer agent for�redemption as any other units. In addition,�Olden Lane may tender units for redemption�that were initially allocated to Olden Lane on the inception date if Olden Lane was unable to sell such units. Such redemption may impact the size, composition, returns, expenses and longevity of the Trust. The public offering price of any units resold by Olden Lane will be the public offering price determined in the manner provided in this prospectus (see �Purchasing Units�Public Offering Price�). Any profit resulting from the resale of such units will belong to Olden Lane which likewise will bear any loss resulting from a lower offering or redemption price subsequent to their acquisition of such units (see �Purchasing Units�Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker-Dealers�).
�
Ownership of Units. Ownership of units will not be evidenced by certificates. All evidence of ownership of units will be recorded in book entry form at Depository Trust Company (�DTC�) through an investor�s broker�s account. Units held through DTC will be registered in the name of its nominee. Individual purchases of beneficial ownership interest in the Trust will be made in book entry form through DTC. Ownership and transfer of units will be evidenced and accomplished by book entries made by DTC and its participants. DTC will record ownership and transfer of the units among DTC participants and forward all notices and credit all payments received in respect of the units held by the DTC participants. The Trust�s obligations, as well as the obligations of the Trustee, custodian, transfer agent and administrator, and the obligations, if any, of the evaluator, supervisor, and Olden
Lane run only to DTC, which is the �unitholder� of the units. Beneficial owners of units will receive written confirmation of their purchases and sale from the broker dealer or bank from whom their purchase was made. Beneficial owners will have to follow their financial intermediary�s procedures for communicating with the transfer agent and transacting with the Trust. For more information about how to purchase, transfer and redeem units through their financial intermediary, beneficial owners of units should contact their financial intermediary directly.
�
Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement. Fractions of units, if any, will be computed to three decimal places.
�
�INVESTMENT RISKS
�
An investment in the units involves significant risks. Some of the general risks that apply to the units are summarized here.��We urge you to also read the explanation of other specific risks relating to the units in the �Risk Factors� section of Part A of the prospectus. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the units.
�
The Units Involve Risk. This section describes some of the main risks that can impact the value of the Trust property. You should understand these risks before you invest and should reach a decision to invest in the Trust only after carefully considering the suitability of such an investment in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this prospectus. You could lose some or all of your investment in the units. If the value of the Trust property falls, the value of your units will also fall. Olden Lane cannot guarantee that the Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.
�
Market Risk.�Market risk is the risk that the value of Trust property may fluctuate. This could cause a decrease in the value of your units. Market value may be affected by a variety of factors including:
�


� 


B-7





� 


�




� 


� General financial markets movements including changes in prices and volatility of the reference index and other Trust property;



�




� 


� Changes in perceptions about the reference index or an issuer of Trust property;



�




� 


� Changes in the financial condition of an issuer of Trust property;



�




� 


� Interest rates and inflation;



�




� 


� Governmental policies and litigation; and



�




� 


� Purchases and sales of Trust property by the Trust.



�
Even though Olden Lane oversees the portfolio in consultation with the supervisor, you should remember that neither Olden Lane nor the supervisor manages the Trust�s portfolio.��The Trust will not sell Trust property solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.
�
Fixed Portfolio.�Investors should be aware that the Trust is not �managed� and as a result, the adverse financial condition of Trust property will not result in its elimination from the portfolio of the Trust except under extraordinary circumstances. Investors should note in particular that the Trust property was selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in Part A of the prospectus and that the Trust may continue to purchase or hold Trust property originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the attractiveness of the Trust property may have changed. Some of the Trust property may also be owned by other clients of Olden Lane. However, because these clients may have differing investment objectives, Olden Lane may sell identical property from those accounts in instances where a sale by the Trust of identical Trust property would be impermissible,
such as to maximize return by taking advantage of market fluctuations.
�
Additional Deposits and Dilution Risk.�The Trust Agreement authorizes Olden Lane to increase the size of the Trust and the number of units thereof by the delivery of additional securities or other property, or cash (including a letter of credit) and thereafter purchasing additional securities.��If applicable, the Trust will enter into additional derivative transactions.��The transfer agent will deliver a corresponding number of additional units. If Olden Lane deposits cash, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Trust property between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of additional Trust property and because the Trust will pay the brokerage fees associated with such purchases.��To minimize this effect, the Trust will attempt to purchase the additional
Trust property as close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible. Olden Lane cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its size for any length of time.
�
Some of the Trust property may have limited trading volume. Olden Lane will endeavor to purchase additional Trust property with deposited cash as soon as practicable and deliver those assets over the ten (10) calendar days following each deposit. At termination of the Trust, Olden Lane reserves the right to sell Trust property over a period of up to twenty (20) business days to lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the Trust property. The proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the Trust will reflect the actual sales proceeds or termination payments (as applicable) received on such Trust property, which will likely differ from any applicable evaluation on the termination date.
�
Payment Risk. An issuer of certain Trust property may be unable or unwilling to make distributions, which may decrease the value of your investment in the Trust.
�
Foreign Securities Risk. The Trust may invest in securities that are issued by foreign entities. Securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities. The prices of foreign securities can be more volatile than U.S. securities due to such factors as political, social and economic developments abroad, the differences between the regulations to which U.S. and foreign issuers and markets are subject, the seizure by the government of company assets, excessive taxation, withholding taxes on dividends and interest, limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets, and political or social instability. Other risks include the following:
�




� 


�


Enforcing legal rights may be difficult, costly and slow in foreign countries, and there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments.



�


� 


B-8





� 


�




���


Foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to U.S. issuers, and there may be less public information about their operations.



�




���


Foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S. markets.



�





���


Foreign securities often trade in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the Trust�s value, the value of dividends and interest earned, and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies may cause the value of the Trust to decline. Certain foreign currencies may be particularly volatile, and foreign governments may intervene in the currency markets, causing a decline in value or liquidity in the Trust�s foreign currency holdings.



�

Litigation and Legislation Risk.�The Trust is also subject to litigation and legislation risk. From time to time, various legislative initiatives are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the issuers of securities held by the Trust. In addition, litigation regarding any of the issuers of securities held by the Trust or of the sectors represented by these issuers, may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively impact the prices of these securities. Olden Lane cannot predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the prices of the securities.
�
Industry Risks. The Trust may invest significantly in certain industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before you invest.
�
Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples. The Trust may invest significantly in companies�that manufacture or sell various consumer products.�General risks of these companies include the overall�state of the economy, intense competition and�consumer spending trends. A decline in the economy�which results in a reduction of consumers� disposable�income can negatively impact spending habits. Global�factors that may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services include political developments, imposition of�import controls, fluctuations in oil prices and changes in�exchange rates.
�
Competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers, but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Consumer products and services companies may be subject to government regulation affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact performance. Tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation.
�
Financial Services. The Trust may invest significantly in banks and other financial services companies. The Trust may also enter into derivative transactions with banks or other financial services companies as counterparty.��In general, financial services companies are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions including, but not limited to: the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets; interest rates, as well as currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate; competition from new entrants in their fields of business; and the overall health of the U.S. and international economies.
�
The financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global developments over the last several years including recessionary conditions, deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt. A substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial institutions, with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers into either liquidation or combination. This has also drastically increased the credit risk, and possibility of default, of derivatives transactions and bonds issued by institutions faced with these problems. Many of the institutions may continue to experience difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. While the U.S. and foreign governments, and their respective government agencies, have taken steps to address problems
in the financial markets and with financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps.
�


� 


B-9





� 


�
Such economic and political conditions and increased public scrutiny during the past several years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad, creating additional challenges for financial institutions. Regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services issuers are currently subject, thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the potential for higher operational, capital and liquidity costs. These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial institution does business and the products and services it may provide. Increased regulation may restrict a company�s ability to compete in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses. New regulations may reduce or limit a company�s revenue or impose additional fees, assessments
or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision, adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative consequences.
�
Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the �Dodd-Frank Act�), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act includes reforms in order to address risks and issues in the nation�s evolving financial system. It also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as systemic risk regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come, including banks, thrifts, depository institution holding companies, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, industrial loan companies, broker dealers and other securities and investment advisory firms, private equity and hedge
funds, consumers, numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure. These regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain Trust property, and could lead to decreases in the profits or revenues of certain issuers of Trust property. In many cases the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on a financial institution�s business remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be completed. Olden Lane is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, on the Trust property or on the financial services industry in general.
�
Healthcare. Investments in healthcare companies are subject to numerous risks, including competition, extensive government regulation and commercial difficulties. These risks are particularly acute for healthcare companies in the pharmaceuticals, devices, life sciences and facilities sub-sectors of the healthcare industry. The performance of healthcare companies is dependent upon successful and timely implementation of their business models, which depends upon such companies ability to successfully introduce new products amidst changing technologies and competition. The success of new product offerings generally depend on many factors, including the ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, obtain or maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property, and
differentiate products from those of competitors. Failure by a healthcare company to introduce successful products on schedule may have material adverse effects on its business, financial condition and operational results. There can be no assurance that any products now in development will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance. In addition, there has been an increased political and regulatory focus on healthcare laws in recent years, and new legislation could have a material effect on the business and operations of healthcare companies by increasing their compliance and other costs of doing business, requiring significant systems enhancements, or rendering their products or services less profitable or obsolete.
�
Industrials. The Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy, intense competition, imposition of import controls, volatility in commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuation, consolidation, labor relations, domestic and international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, depletion of resources, government regulations, government contracts and e-commerce initiatives.
�
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization. Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts, changes in government budget priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and 
�


� 


B-10





� 


�
retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment manufacturers. Stocks of transportation companies are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may negatively impact their businesses.
�
Information Technology. The Trust may invest significantly in information technology companies. These companies include companies that are involved in computer and business services, enterprise software/technical software, Internet and computer software, Internet-related services, networking and telecommunications equipment, telecommunications services, electronics products, server hardware, computer hardware and peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors. These companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the
company�s results. Information technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company. This can impact your ability to redeem the units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid.
�
Utilities. The Trust may invest significantly in utilities companies.��Securities in the utilities industry can be very volatile and can be impacted significantly by supply and demand for services or fuel, government regulation, conservation programs, commodity price fluctuations and other factors. Government regulation or oversight of utility companies may limit those companies� profits or the dividends they can pay to investors. In addition, utility companies may face regulatory restrictions with respect to expansion to new markets, limiting their growth potential. Technological developments may lead to increased competition, which could impact a company�s performance. Utility company equity securities, to the extent they are purchased for their dividend yield, historically have been sensitive to interest rate movements.
�
Inflation Risk.�Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money.
�
Investment Strategy Risk.�Although the Trust�s investment strategy is designed to achieve the Trust�s investment objective, the strategy may not prove to be successful.
�
�DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS
�
Olden Lane may, at its own expense and out of its own profits, pay for third party distribution assistance, including but not limited to, obtaining shelf space in clearing firms and similar activities designed to aid in the sale of Olden Lane�s products. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units.
�
Olden Lane may gain or lose money when it holds units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices. The gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price Olden Lane pays for units and the price at which it sells or redeems them. Olden Lane may also gain or lose money when it deposits securities to create units. The amount of its profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities or other property into the Trust is shown in the �Notes to Trust Portfolio� for the Trust.
�
Public Distribution of Units. During the initial offering period, units of the Trust will be distributed to the public at the public offering price, as is described under �Purchasing Units.� Broker-dealers and others will receive all or a portion of the transactional sales fee set forth in Part A of the prospectus in connection with the distribution of units during the initial offering period.
�
Olden Lane intends to qualify units of the Trust for sale in a number of states, but does not register units for sale in any foreign country. Units will be sold through dealers who are members of FINRA and through others. This prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully.
�


� 


B-11





� 


�
Certain commercial banks may make units of the Trust available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge discussed above is retained by the banks for these agency and brokerage transactions. Olden Lane will retain the balance of any transactional sales fee.
�
Olden Lane reserves the right to change the concessions or agency commissions set forth in Part A of the prospectus from time to time. In addition to such concessions or agency commissions, Olden Lane may, from time to time, pay or allow additional concessions or agency commissions, in the form of cash or other compensation, to dealers employing registered representatives who sell, during a specified time period, a minimum dollar amount of Olden Lane products.
�
Also, Olden Lane in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by Olden Lane pay fees to qualifying brokers or dealers for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the Trust. Such payments are made by Olden Lane out of its own assets, and not out of the assets of the Trust. These programs will not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that the Trust will receive from the units sold.
�
Olden Lane reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of units.
�
Upon the completion of the initial offering, units which remain unsold or which may be acquired in the secondary market may be offered at prices determined in the manner provided under �Selling Units�Redemption�Computation of Redemption Price.�
�
�TRUST ADMINISTRATION
�
Distributions to Unitholders. Income received by the Trust is credited by the Trust�s Custodian to the income account of the Trust. Other receipts are credited to the capital account of the Trust. Income received by the Trust will be distributed on or shortly after the distribution dates each year shown in Part A of the prospectus on a pro rata basis to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date shown in Part A of the prospectus. However, if set forth in Part A of the prospectus that the Trust will prorate distributions on an annual basis (�income averaging�), then income received by the Trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of one-twelfth of the estimated annual income to the Trust for the ensuing 12 months. All distributions will be net of applicable expenses. There is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all income received may be
used to pay expenses. In addition, excess amounts from the capital account of the Trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record. Proceeds received from the income of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account. The Custodian is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds).
�
Olden Lane will direct the Custodian to periodically deduct from the income account of the Trust and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the capital account of the Trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trust. The Custodian will withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as Olden Lane deems necessary to establish a reserve for any taxes or governmental charges payable out of the Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the Trust�s assets until such time as Olden Lane directs the Custodian to return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts. In addition, the Custodian may withdraw from the income and capital accounts of the Trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units.
�
The Trust. The Trust is a unit investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Olden Lane created the Trust under the Master Trust Agreement between Olden Lane Securities LLC (as depositor) and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the �Trustee�). [●] (as custodian, transfer agent and administrator) performs services for the Trust, Olden Lane Advisors LLC acts as evaluator and supervisor and Olden Lane acts as depositor, pursuant to the Services Agreement among Olden Lane Trust, Olden Lane Securities LLC, Olden Lane Advisors LLC and [●].
�
To create the Trust, Olden Lane delivered securities or other property to the Custodian (or contracts to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit, cash or other consideration to pay for the securities) and, to the 
�


� 


B-12





� 


�
extent applicable, otherwise executed and delivered on behalf of the Trust certain derivatives agreements. Upon the Custodian�s receipt, the transfer agent recorded ownership of units of the Trust in the name of Olden Lane. Each unit represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust. These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until the Trust dissolves. At the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the inception date or on the first day units are sold to the public, if later, the number of units or options premium may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals $10 or some other round number such as $100 or $1,000. The number of units, underlying asset to unit ratio, options premium and/or fractional interest of each unit in the Trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.
�
Changes to the Portfolio. The Trust is not a managed fund. Unlike a managed fund, Olden Lane designed the Trust�s portfolio to remain relatively fixed after its inception and until its termination. Although the portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated and Olden Lane, in consultation with the supervisor, may sell Trust property under certain limited circumstances, Trust property will not be sold by the Trust to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation. As a result, the amount realized upon the sale of Trust property may not be the highest price attained by certain Trust property during the life of the Trust. The prices of Trust property may vary widely, and the effect of a dollar of fluctuation, either higher or lower, in market prices will be much greater as a percentage of the lower-priced property�s purchase price than as a percentage of the higher-price
property�s purchase price.��You will not be able to direct the disposition of or vote any of the securities in the Trust, or exercise any rights in respect of a derivative transaction.��As the holder of the Trust securities, the Custodian will vote the Trust securities as directed by Olden Lane or otherwise will endeavor to vote the Trust securities as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than the Trust.
�
The Trust will generally buy and sell Trust property only to pay expenses and to issue additional units or redeem units.��However, the supervisor may advise Olden Lane to sell, liquidate, transfer or otherwise dispose of Trust property in limited circumstances, if there has been (or may be) a default in the payment of distributions in respect of the securities to avoid direct or indirect ownership of a passive foreign investment company, to make required distributions or pay Trust expenses or to preserve the tax status of the Trust, and under other circumstances as provided in the Services Agreement.
�
The Trust will generally reject any offer to issue, exchange or substitute new securities or property for the securities in its portfolio; provided that if any such issuance, exchange or substitution is effected, any securities, cash and/or property received shall be promptly sold (if securities or property) by Olden Lane and any cash shall be generally distributed to unitholders, unless the supervisor determines the Trust should keep such securities, cash or property.
�
However, if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security, the Trust may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders. The transfer agent will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders. If the Trust receives securities or property other than cash, it will sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds to unitholders, unless otherwise instructed by the Supervisor. For example, this could happen in a merger or similar transaction.
�
Olden Lane will increase the size of the Trust as it sells units. When Olden Lane creates additional units, it will seek to replicate the existing portfolio. When the Trust buys additional Trust property, it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.��Olden Lane may employ a subsidiary or affiliate of the Custodian to act as broker in acquiring such Trust property.��The Trust will pay for these brokerage services at standard commission rates.��You could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in prices between the time Olden Lane creates units and the time the Trust buys additional Trust property. When the Trust buys or sells Trust property, Olden Lane may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including itself and brokers that may be affiliated with the Custodian, Olden Lane or dealers participating in the offering of units. Olden Lane cannot
guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size for any length of time.
�
Replacement Securities. In the event that any contract to purchase any security is not consummated in accordance with its terms (�failed contract security�), Olden Lane may either effect a buy-in in accordance with the rules of the marketplace where the failed contract securities were purchased or its clearing house or purchase a 
�


� 


B-13





� 


�
replacement security (the �replacement security�) which has been selected by Olden Lane applying funds held by the Custodian. Purchases of replacement securities will be made subject to the following conditions:
�




���


The replacement securities will be securities as originally selected for the Trust;



�




���


The purchase of the replacement securities will not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the Trust;



�




���


The aggregate purchase price of the replacement securities will not exceed the total amount of cash deposited, or the amount drawn with regard to the failed contract securities under the letter of credit deposited, by Olden Lane at the time of the deposit of the failed contract security;



�




���


The replacement securities will be purchased within 30 days after the deposit of the failed contract security.



�
Amending the Services Agreement. The Services Agreement may be amended by the Trust, Olden Lane Advisors LLC, Olden Lane and the Custodian without the consent of any of the unitholders to cure ambiguities or to correct or supplement or change any provisions which may be defective or inconsistent; to change any provision thereof as may be required by governmental or self-regulatory agencies; to make such provisions as shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders; or to make such amendments to preserve the tax status of the Trust.
�
The Services Agreement may also be amended in any respect, or provisions waived, by the parties above, with the consent of the holders of units representing 66-2/3% of outstanding units.��Any amendment or waiver that permits a reduction of the units required to consent to any amendment will require the consent of the affected unitholders.��Similarly, in no event may any amendment be made which would alter the rights to the unitholders as against each other, allow the Trust to engage in business or investment activities other than those described in this prospectus and the Services Agreement, adversely affect the tax status of the Trust purposes or result in the units being deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Services Agreement may not be amended without the consent of all unitholders, so as to permit, except as otherwise disclosed herein, the acquisition hereunder of any securities
or Trust property.
�
In addition, Olden Lane may seek to amend the Services Agreement as it deems necessary or advisable to cause the conversion of the Trust from a unit investment trust to an �open-end company� or to a �closed-end company,� as those terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, provided that the Trust receive the affirmative vote or consent at a meeting of the unitholders of the Trust of the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the units present at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding units of the Trust are present or represented by proxy or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding units of the Trust.
�
Amending the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement may also be amended in any respect by Olden Lane and the Trustee, or provisions waived, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as for the Services Agreement.
�
Dissolution of the Trust. The Trust will dissolve on the termination date set forth under �Essential Information� in Part A of the prospectus. Investors owning two-thirds of the units in the Trust may also vote to terminate the Trust early.��The Trust will dissolve if within ninety days from the time that the Trust�s registration statement has first become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the net worth of the Trust declines to less than $100,000.��The Trust will also dissolve in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the value the Trust property would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Trust property at the time they were deposited in the Trust. In either event, the expenses of the Trust may create an undue burden on your investment and Olden Lane will refund any sales fee and
creation and development fee that you paid.� The depositor may direct the dissolution of the Trust in the event a trust series evaluation made following the end of the initial offering period is less than 40% of the total value of Trust property deposited in such Trust during the initial offering period. If specified in Part A of the prospectus, Olden Lane may direct the dissolution of the Trust if (i)�a minimum value or trigger is met, or, with respect to a Trust having derivatives transactions, if a default, termination event or similar event in respect of a derivative counterparty or the Trust has occurred or (ii)�due to (x) any action taken by a governmental authority, or brought in court, or (y) a change in law (including tax law) or in the application or official interpretation of any law, there is, or there is a substantial likelihood that the Trust will be

prohibited or impaired in any material way from pursuing its principal investment strategy in the same manner and with the same economic terms as on the inception date.��In addition, if a default, termination event or similar event in respect of the Trust occurs and the derivative counterparty directs the termination of the derivative agreement, Olden Lane will direct the dissolution of the Trust.
�
Olden Lane will liquidate all securities and terminate all derivative agreements in connection with the dissolution of the Trust. The transfer agent will notify you of any termination. The Custodian will make a final distribution of assets to unitholders on the fifth (5th) business day following liquidation of all the securities after deducting final expenses. Your termination distribution may be less than the price you originally paid for your units.

The Sponsor and Depositor. The sponsor and depositor of the Trust is Olden Lane Securities LLC. The sponsor intends to be and has made filings to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer. The sponsor is organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. The sponsor intends to be a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Both the foregoing registrations and the memberships will be effective prior to the sale of any units. The principal office of Olden Lane is located at 1 Main Street, Suite 202, Chatham, New Jersey 07928.
�
If at any time Olden Lane shall resign or fail to perform any of its duties as depositor under the Services Agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public authorities, then the supervisor may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the supervisor to be reasonable and not exceeding such reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (b) assume the duties of the depositor and receive additional reasonable compensation not exceeding such reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (c) dissolve and liquidate the Trust. In such case the supervisor shall assume the duties of the depositor in connection with such dissolution. Promptly following the appointment of a successor depositor or the supervisor�s election to assume the duties, the
transfer agent will provide notice to the unitholders of such resignation or failure of the depositor to act and of such appointment or dissolution.
�
The depositor and the Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring their employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to the Trust.

The Supervisor and the Evaluator. Olden Lane Advisors LLC serves as evaluator and supervisor of the Trust. Olden Lane Advisors LLC is an affiliate of Olden Lane and, as a result, a potential conflict of interest may exist. The evaluator and supervisor may resign or be removed by Olden Lane, in which event Olden Lane is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor. Such resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor evaluator or supervisor, as applicable. If upon resignation of the evaluator or supervisor�no successor has accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the evaluator or supervisor may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor. Notice of such registration or removal and appointment shall be delivered by the transfer agent to each unitholder. As evaluator, Olden Lane Advisors
LLC utilizes the administrator to provide the official closing price of any securities listed on a national or foreign securities exchange based on information available to the administrator from a reporting service approved by the evaluator.

�
Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may be removed by Olden Lane upon 30 days prior written notice to the Trustee. The Trustee may resign upon 30 days prior written notice to Olden Lane.

Olden Lane and the supervisor shall be under no liability to the unitholders for any action taken or for refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the performance of their duties. The Trust Agreement has similar protections in respect of Olden Lane.

shall be under no liability to unitholders or any other party to the Services Agreement for errors, but shall not be protected for its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties.
�
The Trust Agreement contains customary provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be personally liable under any circumstances in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement, except that such limitation shall not relieve the Trustee of any personal liability it may have to Olden Lane Trust or the beneficial owners for the Trustee�s own bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of its express duties under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any payment in respect of, register, record, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the assets of Olden Lane Trust or any Trust, or to otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any document contemplated by the Trust Agreement, except as expressly provided by the terms of the Trust Agreement. The duties of the Trustee
are extremely limited.��The duties of the Trustee shall be limited to (i) accepting legal process served on Olden Lane Trust or any Trust in the State of Delaware and (ii) the execution of any certificates required to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State which the Trustee is required to execute pursuant to Delaware law.
�
�EXPENSES OF THE TRUST
�
Olden Lane does not charge the Trust an annual management fee. Olden Lane will receive a portion of the maximum sales fee paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the Trust. The supervisor receives an annual fee as set forth in Part A of the prospectus for portfolio supervisory services for the Trust (the �supervisory fee�). In providing such supervisory services, the supervisor may purchase research from a variety of sources, which may include dealers of the Trust. If so provided in Part A of the prospectus, Olden Lane may also receive an annual fee for providing bookkeeping and administrative services for the Trust (the �bookkeeping and administrative fee�). Such services may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of various materials for unitholders and providing account information to
the unitholders. If so provided in Part A of the prospectus, the evaluator may also receive an annual fee for performing valuation services for the Trust (the �evaluation fee�). In addition, if so provided in Part A of the prospectus, the Trust may be charged a licensing fee to cover licenses for the use of service marks, trademarks, trade names and intellectual property rights and/or for the use of databases and research.
�
The Custodian receives for its services as custodian, transfer agent and administrator the fee set forth in Part A of the prospectus. The Custodian�s fee is initially based on the number of units of the Trust outstanding at the end of each month during the initial offering period. After the end of the initial offering period, the fee shall accrue daily and be based on the number of units outstanding on the most recent of January 1 of each calendar year, except for a Trust during the year in which an initial offering period occurs, in which case the fee is based on the number of units outstanding at the end of such month until the end of the initial offering period. The supervisory fee, the bookkeeping and administrative fee and the evaluation fee are based on the number of units and computed in a similar manner. The Custodian benefits to the extent there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions
in the capital and income accounts since these accounts are non-interest bearing and the amounts earned by the Custodian are available for use by the Custodian in accordance with applicable law. Part of the Custodian�s compensation for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of these funds.
�
The supervisory fee, bookkeeping and administrative fee, evaluation fee and the Custodian�s fee may be adjusted in accordance with the cumulative percentage increase of the U.S. Department of Labor�s Consumer Price Index entitled �All Services Less Rent of Shelter� since the establishment of the Trust. In addition, with respect to any fees payable to Olden Lane or an affiliate of Olden Lane for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services, supervisory services and valuation services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs of providing such services for the Trust, but at no time will the total amount received for such services, in the aggregate, rendered to all series of Olden Lane Trust in any calendar year exceed the actual cost to Olden Lane or its affiliates of supplying such services, in the aggregate, in such year.
�
The Trust will also pay a fee to Olden Lane for creating and developing the Trust, including determining the Trust objective, policies, composition and size, selecting service providers and information services, and for providing other similar administrative and ministerial functions. The Trust pays this �creation and development fee� either as a fixed dollar amount or, if daily accrual is specified in Part A of the prospectus, in an amount equal to the 
�


� 


B-17





� 


�
accrued and unpaid fee as of the date(s) set forth in Part A. Olden Lane does not use the fee to pay distribution expenses.
�
The Trust may pay certain fees for the services of a portfolio consultant and for the use of intellectual property.
�
The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the Trust: (a) any and all expenses and disbursements incurred under the Services Agreement, including license fees, if any, legal, tax accounting and reporting and auditing expenses, including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other advisors of the Trust, expenses incurred in connection with any communications disseminated by Depository Trust Company, sub-custodial fees, and for any extraordinary services performed by the Custodian under the Services Agreement relating to such Trust; (b) various governmental charges; (c)�foreign custodial and transaction fees (which may include compensation paid to the Custodian or its subsidiaries or affiliates), if any; and (d)�expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon termination of the Trust.
The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trust and, when owing to the Custodian, are secured by a lien on the Trust. Certain Trust property may make distributions, though such amounts, if any, are unpredictable. Olden Lane cannot provide any assurance that any distributions of Trust property will be sufficient to meet any or all expenses of the Trust. If the balances in the income and capital accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts payable by the Trust, Olden Lane, on behalf of the Trust, will sell Trust property to pay such amounts. These sales may result in capital gains or losses to unitholders. Part A of the prospectus will specify whether the distributions are expected to be sufficient to meet the expenses of the Trust and, accordingly, whether it is expected that Trust property will be sold to pay all or any of the fees and expenses of the Trust.
�
The Trust shall also bear the expenses associated with updating the Trust�s registration statement and maintaining registration or qualification of the units and/or the Trust under federal or state securities and commodities laws subsequent to initial registration. Such expenses shall include legal fees, accounting fees, typesetting fees, electronic filing expenses and regulatory filing fees.
�
�PORTFOLIO TRANSACTION AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION
�
When the Trust sells Trust property, the composition and diversity of the Trust property in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for the Trust, it may be necessary for the supervisor to specify minimum amounts (such as 100 shares) in which blocks of securities are to be sold or minimum quantities of derivative transactions may be terminated. In effecting purchases and sales of the Trust property, Olden Lane may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated with the Custodian or dealers participating in the offering of units.
�
�TAX STATUS
�
This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning units of the Trust. This section is current as of the date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are treated as a partnership or S corporation for U.S. tax purposes, you hold the units as other than a capital asset, you are a broker/dealer or securities trader electing mark-to-market treatment, you are a bank, thrift or other financial institution, a former citizen or resident of the United States, an investor whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, an investor subject to the alternative minimum tax, a �controlled foreign corporation� or �passive foreign investment company� for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or are otherwise
subject to special tax rules. In addition, this section, other than the discussions under ��Backup Withholding,� ��Foreign Unitholders,� and ��FATCA,� does not describe your situation if you are not a �United States person� as defined in the Code. This section also does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.
�
This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to Olden Lane. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Trust�s units, as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, foreign country or other taxing jurisdiction.

Taxation of the Trust.��The Trust has elected and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. A RIC generally is not subject to federal income tax on income and gains distributed in a timely manner to its unitholders. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, the Trust generally must, among other things:
�
(a)������derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from (i) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures, or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and (ii) net income derived from interests in �qualified publicly traded partnerships� as described below (the income described in this subparagraph (a), �Qualifying Income�);
�
(b)������diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the Trust�s taxable year (or by the end of the 30-day period following the close of such quarter), (i) at least 50% of the fair market value of the Trust�s total assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to a value not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust�s total assets and to an amount not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not greater than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in (x) the securities (other than U.S. government securities and the securities of other RICs) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the Trust controls and that are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses, or (y) the securities
of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (as defined below); and
�
(c)������distribute with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of the sum of its investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in the Code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid�generally, taxable ordinary income and the excess, if any, of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and net tax-exempt interest income, for such year.
�
For purposes of the diversification test, the identification of the issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a particular Trust investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment. In some cases, identification of the issuer (or issuers) is uncertain under current law, and an adverse determination or future guidance by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the Trust's ability to meet the diversification test in (b) above.
�
In general, for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement described in subparagraph (a) above, income derived from a partnership will be treated as Qualifying Income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be Qualifying Income if realized directly by the RIC. However, 100% of the net income of a RIC derived from an interest in a �qualified publicly traded partnership� (a partnership (x) the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and (y) that derives less than 90% of its income from the Qualifying Income described in clause (i) of subparagraph (a) above) will be treated as Qualifying Income. In general, such entities will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes because they meet the passive income requirement under Code section 7704(c)(2).
In addition, although in general the passive loss rules of the Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership. Moreover, the amounts derived from investments in foreign currency will be treated as Qualifying Income for purposes of subparagraph (a) above. There is a possibility that the IRS could issue guidance contrary to such treatment, which could affect the Trust�s ability to meet the 90% gross income test and adversely affect the manner in which the Trust is managed.
�
For purposes of the diversification test described in subparagraph (b) above, the term �outstanding voting securities of such issuer� will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership. Also, for purposes of the diversification test in (b) above, the identification of the issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a particular Trust investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment. In some cases, identification of the issuer (or issuers) is uncertain under current law, and an adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the Trust�s ability to meet the diversification test in (b) above.
�

B-19





� 


�
If, in any taxable year, the Trust were to fail to meet the 90% gross income, diversification or distribution test described above, the Trust could in some cases cure such failure, including by paying a Trust-level tax, paying interest, making additional distributions, or disposing of certain assets. If the Trust were ineligible to or did not cure such a failure for any taxable year, or otherwise failed to qualify as a RIC accorded special tax treatment under the Code, the Trust would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates, and all distributions from earnings and profits, including distributions of net tax-exempt income and net long-term capital gain (if any), would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income. In such a case, distributions from the Trust would not be deductible by the Trust in computing its taxable income. In addition, in order to requalify for taxation as a RIC, the Trust may be required
to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest, and make certain distributions.
�
As noted above, if the Trust qualifies as a RIC that is accorded special tax treatment, the Trust will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed in a timely manner to its unitholders in the form of dividends (including Capital Gain Dividends, as defined below).
�
The Trust expects to distribute at least annually to its unitholders all or substantially all of its investment company taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction) and its net capital gain (that is, the excess of its net long-term capital gains over its net short-term capital losses, in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards). Investment company taxable income that is retained by the Trust will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates. If the Trust retains any net capital gain, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained, but it may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice mailed within 60 days of the close of the Trust�s taxable year to its unitholders who, in turn, (i) will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their shares of such undistributed amount,
and (ii) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Trust on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds on a properly-filed U.S. tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. If the Trust makes this designation, for federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of units owned by a unitholder of the Trust will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the unitholder�s gross income under clause (i) of the preceding sentence and the tax deemed paid by the unitholder under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence. The Trust is not required to, and there can be no assurance that the Trust will, make this designation if it retains all or a portion of its net capital gain in a taxable year.
�
In determining the amount available to support a Capital Gain Dividend (as defined below), its taxable income and its earnings and profits, a RIC generally may elect to treat part or all of any post-October capital loss (defined as the greatest of net capital loss, net long-term capital loss, or net short-term capital loss, in each case attributable to the portion of the taxable year after October 31) or late-year ordinary loss (generally, (i) net ordinary loss from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of property, attributable to the portion of the taxable year after October 31, plus (ii) other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion of the taxable year after December 31) as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year.
�
Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a prescribed formula are subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax at the Trust level. To avoid the tax, the Trust must distribute during each calendar year an amount generally equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) all such ordinary income and capital gains that were not distributed in previous years. For purposes of the required excise tax distribution, ordinary gains and losses from the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of property that would be properly taken into account after October 31 are generally treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year.
Also, for these purposes, the Trust will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it is subject to corporate income tax for the taxable year ending within the calendar year. The Trust intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the excise tax, although the Trust reserves the right to pay an excise tax rather than make an additional distribution.
�
A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of a calendar year if it is declared by the Trust in October, November or December of that year with a record date in such a month and is paid by the Trust during January of the following year. Such distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.
�


� 


B-20





� 


�
Capital losses in excess of capital gains (�net capital losses�) are not permitted to be deducted against the Trust�s net investment income. Instead, potentially subject to certain limitations, the Trust may carry net capital losses forward from any taxable year to subsequent taxable years to offset capital gains, if any, realized during such subsequent taxable years. Distributions from capital gains are generally made after applying any available capital loss carryforwards. Capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset current-year net realized capital gains, whether the Trust retains or distributes such gains. If the Trust incurs or has incurred net capital losses, those losses will be carried forward to one or more subsequent taxable years without expiration; any such carryforward losses will retain their character as short-term or long-term.
�
Taxation of Trust Distributions. Distributions of investment income are generally taxable to unitholders as ordinary income. Taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the Trust owned the investments that generated them, rather than how long a unitholder has owned his or her units. In general, the Trust will recognize long-term capital gain or loss on investments it has owned for more than one year, and short-term capital gain or loss on investments it has owned for one year or less. Tax rules can alter the Trust�s holding period in investments and thereby affect the tax treatment of gain or loss on such investments. Distributions of net capital gain � the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital losses, in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards � that are properly reported by the Trust as capital gain dividends (�Capital
Gain Dividends�) will be taxable to unitholders as long-term capital gains includible in net capital gain and may be taxable to individuals at reduced rates. Distributions of net short-term capital gain (as reduced by any net long-term capital loss for the taxable year) will be taxable to unitholders as ordinary income.
�
Section 1411 of the Code generally imposes a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals whose income exceeds certain threshold amounts, and of certain trusts and estates under similar rules. The details of the implementation of this tax and of the calculation of net investment income, among other issues, are currently unclear and remain subject to future guidance. For these purposes, �net investment income� generally includes, among other things, (i)�distributions paid by the Trust of net investment income and capital gains as described above, and (ii)�any net gain from the sale, redemption or exchange of Trust units. Unitholders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment in the Trust.
�
Distributions are taxable whether unitholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional units. Distributions are also taxable to unitholders even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the Trust before a unitholder�s investment (and thus were included in the price the unitholder paid for the Trust units). Investors should be careful to consider the tax implications of buying units of the Trust just prior to a distribution. The price of units purchased at this time will include the amount of the forthcoming distribution, but the distribution will generally be taxable.
�
A dividend or Capital Gain Dividend with respect to units of the Trust held by a tax-deferred or qualified plan, such as an IRA, retirement plan, or corporate pension or profit sharing plan, generally will not be taxable to the plan. Distributions from such plans will be taxable to individual participants under applicable tax rules without regard to the character of the income earned by the qualified plan. Unitholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the suitability of units of the Trust as an investment through such plans and the precise effect of an investment on their particular situation.
�
Unitholders will be notified annually as to the U.S. federal tax status of Trust distributions, and unitholders receiving distributions in the form of newly issued units will receive a report as to the value of the units received.
�
Qualified Dividend Income for Trusts that Hold Equity Securities. �Qualified dividend income� received by an individual is taxed at the rates applicable to net capital gain.��In order for some portion of the dividends received by a unitholder to be qualified dividend income, the Trust must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividend-paying stocks in the portfolio and the unitholder must meet holding period or other requirements with respect to the Trust�s units.
�
Dividends-Received Deduction for Trusts that Hold Equity Securities. In general, dividends of net investment income received by unitholders of the Trust will qualify for the 70% dividends-received deduction generally 
�


� 


B-21





� 


�
available to corporations to the extent of the amount of eligible dividends received by the Trust from domestic corporations for the taxable year.
�
Disposition of Units. Upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of units of the Trust, a unitholder will generally realize a taxable gain or loss depending upon his or her basis in the units. A gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the units are capital assets in the unitholder�s hands, and generally will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss depending upon the unitholder�s holding period for the units. Any loss realized on a sale, exchange or other disposition will be disallowed to the extent the units disposed of are replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the units are disposed of. In such a case, the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a unitholder on the disposition of the Trust�s units held by the unitholder for six
months or less will be treated for tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions of Capital Gain Dividends received or treated as having been received by the unitholder with respect to such units.
�
Market Discount. If the Trust purchases in the secondary market a debt security that has a fixed maturity date of more than one year from its date of issuance at a price lower than the stated redemption price of such debt security (or, in the case of a debt security issued with �original issue discount� (described below), a price below the debt security�s �revised issue price�), the excess of the stated redemption price over the purchase price is �market discount.� If the amount of market discount is more than a de minimis amount, a portion of such market discount must be included as ordinary income (not capital gain) by the Trust in each taxable year in which the Trust owns an interest in such debt security and receives a principal payment on it. In particular, the Trust will be required to allocate that principal payment first to the portion of the market
discount on the debt security that has accrued but has not previously been includable in income. In general, the amount of market discount that must be included for each period is equal to the lesser of (i)�the amount of market discount accruing during such period (plus any accrued market discount for prior periods not previously taken into account) or (ii)�the amount of the principal payment with respect to such period. Generally, market discount accrues on a daily basis for each day the debt security is held by the Trust at a constant rate over the time remaining to the debt security�s maturity or, at the election of the Trust, at a constant yield to maturity which takes into account the semi-annual compounding of interest. Gain realized on the disposition of a market discount obligation must be recognized as ordinary interest income (not capital gain) to the extent of the accrued market discount.
�
Original Issue Discount. Certain debt securities may be treated as debt securities that were originally issued at a discount. Original issue discount can generally be defined as the difference between the price at which a security was issued and its stated redemption price at maturity. Original issue discount that accrues on a debt security in a given year generally is treated for federal income tax purposes as interest income that is included in the Trust�s income and, therefore, subject to the distribution requirements applicable to RICs, even though the Trust may not receive a corresponding amount of cash until a partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security.
�
Some debt securities may be purchased by the Trust at a discount that exceeds the original issue discount on such debt securities, if any. This additional discount represents market discount for federal income tax purposes (see above).
�
If the Trust holds the foregoing kinds of securities, it may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount which is greater than the total amount of cash interest the Trust actually received. Such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the Trust or, if necessary, by disposition of Trust property including at a time when it may not be advantageous to do so. These dispositions may cause the Trust to realize higher amounts of short-term capital gains (generally taxed to unitholders at ordinary income tax rates) and, in the event the Trust realizes net capital gains from such transactions, its unitholders may receive a larger Capital Gain Dividend than if the Trust had not held such securities.
�
Options, Futures, Forward Contracts and Swaps. The tax treatment of certain contracts (including regulated futures contracts and non-equity options) entered into by the Trust will be governed by Section 1256 of the Code (�Section 1256 contracts�). Gains (or losses) on these contracts generally are considered to be 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gains or losses (�60/40�), although foreign currency
gains or losses arising from certain Section 1256 contracts may be treated as ordinary in character (see �Foreign Currency Transactions� below). Also, Section 1256 contracts held by the Trust at the end of each taxable year (and for purposes of the 4% excise tax, on 
�


� 


B-22





� 


�
certain other dates prescribed in the Code) are �marked-to-market� with the result that unrealized gains or losses are treated as though they were realized and the resulting gains or losses are treated as ordinary or 60/40 gains or losses, as appropriate.
�
The tax treatment of a payment made or received on a swap to which the Trust is a party, and in particular whether such payment is, in whole or in part, capital or ordinary in character, will vary depending upon the terms of the particular swap contract.
�
Transactions in options, futures, forward contracts and swaps undertaken by the Trust may result in �straddles� for federal income tax purposes. The straddle rules may affect the character of gains (or losses) realized by the Trust, and losses realized by the Trust on positions that are part of a straddle may be deferred under the straddle rules, rather than being taken into account in calculating taxable income for the taxable year in which the losses are realized. In addition, certain carrying charges (including interest expense) associated with positions in a straddle may be required to be capitalized rather than deducted currently. Certain elections that the Trust may make with respect to its straddle positions may also affect the amount, character and timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the
affected positions.
�
Because only a few regulations implementing the straddle rules have been promulgated, the consequences of such transactions to the Trust are not entirely clear. The straddle rules may increase the amount of short-term capital gain realized by a Trust, which is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to unitholders. Because application of the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses, defer losses and/or accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions, the amount which must be distributed to unitholders as ordinary income or long-term capital gain may be increased or decreased substantially as compared to a Trust that did not engage in such transactions.
�
More generally, investments by the Trust in options, futures, forward contracts, swaps and other derivative financial instruments are subject to numerous special and complex tax rules. These rules could affect whether gains and losses recognized by the Trust are treated as ordinary or capital, accelerate the recognition of income or gains to the Trust and defer or possibly prevent the recognition or use of certain losses by the Trust. The rules could, in turn, affect the amount, timing or character of the income distributed to unitholders by the Trust. In addition, because the tax rules applicable to such instruments may be uncertain under current law, an adverse determination or future IRS guidance with respect to these rules (which determination or guidance could be retroactive) may affect whether the Trust has made sufficient distributions
and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements (including qualifying income and diversification requirements) to maintain its qualification as a RIC and avoid a Trust-level tax.���Accordingly, while the Trust intends to account for such transactions in a manner it deems to be appropriate, the IRS might not accept such treatment. If it did not, the status of the Trust as a regulated investment company might be affected. Further, requirements that must be met under the Code in order for the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment company, including the qualifying income and diversification requirements applicable to a the Trust's assets may limit the extent to which the Trust will be able to engage in transactions in options, futures contracts, forward contracts, swap, and other derivative
agreements.
�
Constructive Sales. Under certain circumstances, the Trust may recognize gain from a constructive sale of an �appreciated financial position� it holds if it enters into a short sale, forward contract or other transaction that substantially reduces the risk of loss with respect to the appreciated position. In that event, the Trust would be treated as if it had sold and immediately repurchased the property and would be taxed on any gain (but would not recognize any loss) from the constructive sale. The character of gain from a constructive sale would depend upon the Trust�s holding period in the property. Appropriate adjustments would be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized on the position to reflect the gain recognized on the constructive sale. Loss from a constructive sale would
be recognized when the property was subsequently disposed of, and its character would depend on the Trust�s holding period and the application of various loss deferral provisions of the Code. Constructive sale treatment does not generally apply to a transaction if such transaction is closed on or before the end of the 30th day after the close of the Trust�s taxable year and the Trust holds the appreciated financial position throughout the 60-day period beginning with the day such transaction closed. The term �appreciated financial position� excludes any position that is �marked-to-market.�
�


� 


B-23





� 


�
Unrelated Business Taxable Income. Under current law, income of a RIC that would be treated as UBTI if earned directly by a tax-exempt entity generally will not be attributed as UBTI to a tax-exempt entity that is a unitholder in the RIC. Notwithstanding this �blocking� effect, a tax-exempt unitholder could realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in the Trust if units in the Trust constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt unitholder within the meaning of Code section 514(b).
�
A tax-exempt unitholder may also recognize UBTI if the Trust recognizes �excess inclusion income� derived from direct or indirect investments in residual interests in REMICs or equity interests in TMPs if the amount of such income recognized by the Trust exceeds the Trust�s investment company taxable income (after taking into account deductions for dividends paid by the Trust).
�
In addition, special tax consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts (�CRTs�) that invest in RICs that invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in REMICs or equity interests in TMPs. Under legislation enacted in December 2006, a CRT (as defined in section 664 of the Code) that realizes any UBTI for a taxable year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such UBTI. Under IRS guidance issued in October 2006, a CRT will not recognize UBTI as a result of investing in a Trust that recognizes �excess inclusion income.� Rather, if at any time during any taxable year a CRT (or one of certain other tax-exempt unitholders, such as the United States, a state or political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, and certain energy cooperatives) is a record holder of a unit in a Trust that recognizes �excess inclusion income,� then the Trust will be subject
to a tax on that portion of its �excess inclusion income� for the taxable year that is allocable to such unitholders at the highest federal corporate income tax rate. The extent to which this IRS guidance remains applicable in light of the December 2006 legislation is unclear. To the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Trust may elect to specially allocate any such tax to the applicable CRT, or other unitholder, and thus reduce such unitholder�s distributions for the year by the amount of the tax that relates to such unitholder�s interest in the Trust. The Trust has not yet determined whether such an election will be made.
�
CRTs and other tax-exempt investors are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences of investing in the Trust.
�
Backup Withholding. The Trust may be required to withhold federal income tax (�backup withholding�) from dividends and capital gains distributions paid to unitholders. Federal tax will be withheld if (1)�the unitholder fails to furnish the Trust with the unitholder�s correct taxpayer identification number or social security number, (2)�the IRS notifies the unitholder or the Trust that the unitholder has failed to report properly certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect, or (3)�when required to do so, the unitholder fails to certify to the Trust that he or she is not subject to backup withholding. The current backup withholding rate is 28%. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against the unitholder�s federal income tax liability.
�
In order for a foreign investor to qualify for exemption from the backup withholding tax rates and for reduced withholding tax rates under income tax treaties, the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing requirements. Foreign investors in the Trust should consult their tax advisors in this regard.
�
Foreign Unitholders. Distributions that are properly designated as Capital Gain Dividends generally will not be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax, except as described below under ��FATCA�. In general, dividends, other than Capital Gain Dividends, paid by the Trust to a unitholder that is not a �United States person� within the meaning of the Code (such unitholder, a �foreign unitholder�) are subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) even if they are funded by income or gains (such as portfolio interest, short-term capital gains or foreign-source dividend and interest income) that, if paid to a foreign unitholder directly, would not be subject to withholding.
�
For distributions with respect to RIC taxable years beginning before January 1, 2014, RICs generally were not required to withhold any amounts (i) with respect to distributions��from U.S.-source interest income of types similar to those not subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign investor��(other than distributions (w) to an investor that did not provide a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner was not a United States person, (x) that were attributable to certain interest on an obligation issued by the investor, or by an obligor with respect to which the investor was a �10-percent shareholder� or a related �controlled foreign 
�


� 


B-24





� 


�
corporation,� or (y) to an investor that was within a foreign country that had an inadequate information exchange with the United States), to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the RIC in a written notice to its investors (�interest-related dividends�), or (ii) with respect to distributions of net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses (other than distributions to an individual foreign investor who was present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the distribution), to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the RIC in a written notice to its investors (�short-term capital gain dividends�). It is currently unclear whether Congress will extend these exemptions for distributions with respect to taxable years of a RIC beginning on or after January
1, 2014, or what the terms of such an extension would be. Foreign unitholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts.
�
If a beneficial owner of Trust units who or which is a foreign unitholder has a trade or business in the United States, and dividends from the Trust are effectively connected with the conduct by the beneficial holder of that trade or business, the dividends will in general be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at regular income tax rates and, in the case of a foreign corporation, may also be subject to a branch profits tax.
�
In general, except as described below under ��FATCA,� a beneficial holder of units that is a foreign unitholder is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on gains (and is not allowed a deduction for losses) realized on the sale of units of the Trust or on Capital Gain Dividends unless (i)�such Capital Gain Dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business carried on by such holder within the United States; or (ii)�in the case of an individual holder, the holder is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of the Capital Gain Dividend and certain other conditions are met.
�
If a unitholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty, any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the unitholder in the United States.
�
Foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors and, if holding units through intermediaries, their intermediaries, concerning the application of these rules to an investment in the Trust.
�
FATCA. Sections 1471 and 1472 of the Code (commonly referred to as �FATCA�) generally require the Trust to obtain certain information from each of its unitholders. If a unitholder fails to provide this information, or is a �nonparticipating foreign financial institution,� the Trust may be required to withhold at a rate of 30% with respect to that unitholder on dividends and other distributions, including Capital Gain Dividends, and the proceeds of the sale, redemption or exchange of Trust units. If a payment by the Trust is subject to withholding under these rules, the Trust is required to withhold even if such payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to foreign unitholders described above (e.g., Capital Gain Dividends and short-term capital gain and interest-related dividends), beginning as early as July
1, 2014.
�
Each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of these rules and any other reporting requirements with respect to the prospective investor�s own situation, including investments through an intermediary.
�
Foreign Financial Account Reporting. Unitholders that are U.S. persons and own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Trust could be required to report annually their �financial interest� in the Trust�s �foreign financial accounts,� if any, on Treasury Department Form TD F 90-22.1, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). Unitholders should consult a tax advisor, and persons investing in the Trust through an intermediary should contact their intermediary, regarding the applicability to them of this reporting requirement.
�
Tax Equalization. The Trust intends to distribute its net investment income and capital gains to unitholders at least annually to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code. Under current law, provided the Trust is not treated as a �personal holding company� for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust is permitted to treat on its tax return as dividends paid the portion of redemption proceeds paid to redeeming shareholders that represents the redeeming unitholders� portion of the Trust�s undistributed investment company taxable income and net capital gain. This practice, which involves the use of tax �equalization�, may have the effect of reducing the amount of income and/or gains that the Trust is required to distribute as dividends to non-redeeming unitholders. The amount of any 
�


� 


B-25





� 


�
undistributed income and/or gains is reflected in the value of the Trust�s units. The total return on a unitholder�s investment will generally not be reduced as a result of the Trust�s use of this practice.
�
Tax Shelter Disclosure. Under Treasury regulations, if a unitholder recognizes a loss on a disposition of the Trust�s units of $2 million or more for an individual unitholder or $10 million or more for a corporate unitholder (including, for example, an insurance company holding separate account), the unitholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but, under current guidance, unitholders of a RIC are not excepted. This filing requirement applies even though, as a practical matter, any such loss would not, for example, reduce the taxable income of an insurance company. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to unitholders of most or all RICs. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination
of whether the taxpayer�s treatment of the loss is proper. Unitholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.
�
Other Taxation. The foregoing discussion is primarily a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Trust based on the law in effect as of the date of this prospectus. The discussion does not address in detail special tax rules applicable to certain classes of investors. Such shareholders may be subject to U.S. tax��rules that differ significantly from those summarized above. You should consult your tax advisor for more information about your own tax situation, including possible other federal, state, local and, where applicable, foreign tax consequences of investing in the Trust.

Undertaking to File Reports


Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission such supplementary and periodic information, documents, and reports as may be prescribed by any rule or regulation of the Commission heretofore or hereafter duly adopted pursuant to authority conferred in that section.


Undertaking in Respect of Federal Securities Law Indemnities


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the �Act�), may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
