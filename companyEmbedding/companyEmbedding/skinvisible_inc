The Ultimate Polymer Delivery System.






























Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc.


Skinvisible, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is an R&D pharmaceutical company that develops enhanced, patent protected dermatology and healthcare products including products to treat acne, skin cancers, eczema, fungal infections, inflammation, warts and dermatitis along with sunscreens, anti-aging products, 
		
alcohol-free hand sanitizing lotions, pre-surgical preparations, and various other medical treatments using its patented technology Invisicare�.  Skinvisible's primary objective is to license these prescription and over-the-counter products into the $65 billion global dermatology market and other medical markets. Potential licensees include international and multi-national pharmaceutical, cosmetic, skincare and consumer goods companies seeking new products, product enhancements or life cycle management for their existing products. Click here to see current licensees.

The Technology:  Invisicare� is a patented technology that enhances how drugs are delivered on, in or through the skin.  It can control the release of active ingredients, providing a greater and longer release, while at the same time reducing irritation to the skin.  It also binds products to the skin for 4 hours and more, resisting wash-off and rub-off.   Skinvisible has developed a portfolio of 40+ topical products using Invisicare (prescription, over-the-counter and cosmeceutical) and also works directly with companies to enhance their products, especially ones coming off patent. Invisicare can be tailored to almost any type of molecule and the needs our customers. Learn more at www.invisicare.com.

Intellectual Property:  Skinvisible's value lies in its ability to continually generate new IP on dermatology and medical products formulated with Invisicare. Patent approvals are sought in the U.S. and internationally for all products developed. Skinvisible has fourteen patents granted, including comprehensive patents on Invisicare, the foundation of all of our products; three in the US, and internationally in Canada, Europe (4), China, India, Australia, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, Skinvisible has been granted three product specific patents in the US for dermal barrier products, sunscreens (photostability of avobenzone) and retinoids (stabilization). There are a number of U.S. and international (PCT) patents pending, with many more patent applications in progress. Some of these patents cover up to five products. All patents with Invisicare are owned by Skinvisible.   
Click here to learn more about our patents. 

The Opportunity:   Pharmaceutical companies pursue new or improved revenue streams along with protecting their own patented products. New product formulations are expensive and time intensive for companies to undertake.  Invisicare allows companies to sell a patent-protected product that has been revitalized with new benefits, providing a new story to help combat generic competitors. A perscription dermatology product can generate $100+ million per year; many even more - that's why a pharmaceutical company's investment into an Invisicare formulated product is a very viable option.

The Ultimate Polymer Delivery System.




























Technology
				
Invisicare is a technology for topical and mucosal products which binds ingredients to the skin and enhances their delivery.  The key to Skinvisible's patented technology and trademarked Invisicare family of polymer delivery vehicles is its formula and process for combining hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers into stable complexes in water emulsions.  Learn more about Invisicare at www.invisicare.com.

Life Cycle Management:  A pharmaceutical company plans for the long-term profitability of its products by maximizing the life of their product's patent, developing strategies to combat generics and by introducing product line extensions.  This product life cycle management often includes looking for a new delivery system as a potential solution. Invisicare can be a key component to extend the lifecycle of a patent-protected product. A product that has been reformulated with Invisicare, allows for a new patent submission as well it allows companies to sell their revitalized product with new benefits, giving them a new story to help combat competitors and generics.   Learn more about Skinvisible's patents.

Benefits of Invisicare

Skincare products incorporating Invisicare have the following benefits:


Independent studies have proven that Invisicare holds active ingredients on the skin for up to four hours or more and resists wash off and rub off;
Invisicare enhanced delivery results in improved efficacy, longer duration of action, reduced irritation and lower dosage of active agent required;
Skinvisible's formulations are non-drying as they do not contain alcohol, silicones, waxes, or other organic solvents;
Invisicare provides the ability to control the release of active ingredients - depending on whether a fast or slow delivery is desired;
Products are non-occlusive, forming a protective barrier which still allows for normal skin respiration and perspiration;
Invisicare formulations wear off as part of the natural exfoliation process of the skin's outer layer cells.

(Note:  These are not approved claims in Canada) 



Research & Development

The Company conducts in-house research, development and testing of its Invisicare polymer delivery vehicles, and the products formulated with Invisicare.   In addition, where appropriate for validation and independent verification of marketing claims, it utilizes FDA registered independent laboratories with extensive qualifications for carrying out investigative product studies, utilizing protocols incorporating Good Lab Practice and Good Clinical Practice ("GLP/GCP") standards.  See some of the test results.

LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - July      07, 2017) -   Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (OTCQB: SKVI), is a topical and transdermal product development company with a proprietary drug delivery system Invisicare® which improves how ingredients are delivered to and through the skin including the medicinal components of marijuana; specifically CBD (cannabidiol) and the psychoactive marijuana ingredient THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). As part of the Company's overall growth strategy in this market, Skinvisible announces that by mutual consent, its license agreement with Cannaskin, LLC has been terminated, allowing Skinvisible to pursue without constraints its objective of licensing its cannabis products globally. 

The US and worldwide market for both medicinal and recreational cannabis products is growing exponentially and with that the demand for effective topical and transdermal products. Skinvisible has completed development of its first hemp-derived CBD products and the launch of these products are imminent. The development of THC products will be facilitated by a licensee in Las Vegas, Nevada where both medical and recreational marijuana are now legal. Skinvisible is part of the ancillary cannabis market as Skinvisible does not sell or touch marijuana; it sells its proprietary Invisicare polymers coupled with proven product formulations and services to its licensees.

"Skinvisible has over fifteen years of scientific product development experience and all of our products are developed using stringent pharmaceutical standards," said Terry Howlett, President of Skinvisible. "This expertise is unique in the cannabis industry and will result in consumers getting high quality products that stand out in the marketplace due to their effectiveness. He added, "We are excited about the results we are seeing already just with our hemp-derived CBD products. Our science shows that our CBD products release almost four times that of market leaders and our transdermal product had an 81% penetration rate. These results are significant and prove the difference between ordinary cannabis products and ones enhanced by Invisicare."

Skinvisible's cannabis business strategy includes continuing to actively pursue potential licensees in all 29 US states where medical marijuana is approved beginning with Nevada as well as Canada. These licensees will have the exclusive right to manufacture and distribute Skinvisible's cannabis products within their territory. In the US this requires a licensee in every state where marijuana is approved as the products cannot cross state lines. In Canada the market is significantly different and requires only one licensee. The market in Canada is expanding rapidly, with recreational marijuana recently approved and an implementation date slated for 2018. Skinvisible is also seeking to expand its reach to Europe, Australia and Latin America in the near future.

About Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals is a R&D company that licenses its proprietary formulations made with Invisicare®, its patented polymer delivery system that offers life-cycle management and unique enhancements for topically delivered products. Invisicare holds active ingredients on the skin for extended periods of time along with controlling the release of actives.

Skinvisible Licensee Launches First Prescription Product in the USA   Date : 07/18/2011 @ 9:05AM   Source : GlobeNewswire Inc.   Stock : Skinvisible, Inc. (SKVI)   Quote :  0.075  0.0 (0.00%) @ 8:08AM         Skinvisible Licensee Launches First Prescription Product in the USA     Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:SKVI) is pleased to announce that its licensee, Women's Choice Pharmaceuticals LLC, a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Gilbert, Arizona, has launched ProCort®, Skinvisible's first prescription product in the United States. ProCort® is a topical treatment for hemorrhoids formulated with Skinvisible's patented polymer delivery system Invisicare®. Invisicare enhances the delivery of active ingredients by controlling the release and provides superior binding properties. ProCort® is made of a combination of hydrocortisone acetate and pramoxine hydrochloride. ProCort®, launched this week, is a prescription product focused on the women's health market.   Women's Choice Pharmaceuticals has been granted the exclusive rights to commercialize Skinvisible's product within the United States. Skinvisible has received a development fee and now will receive a license fee paid in milestones plus on-going royalties based on product sales. Women's Choice Pharmaceuticals' revenue forecast for ProCort is $20 million by its third year.   According to the U.S. Department of Health, hemorrhoids are most common among adults over 45 and in pregnant women. They state that approximately 75 percent of people will have hemorrhoids at some point in their lives. The U.S. hemorrhoid market, estimated at $85 million in 2006, is growing by approximately 1 million new cases diagnosed every year.   "ProCort® is Skinvisible's first prescription product launched in the United States and we are very confident Women's Choice Pharmaceuticals will gain market share quickly, as it has with its other product launches," said Mr. Terry Howlett, President and CEO. "This is an example of how Skinvisible's Invisicare technology can meet the growing need for patent-protected options for pharmaceutical companies in dermatology and other markets."   Women's Choice Pharmaceuticals is an innovative specialty pharmaceutical company whose primary focus is to provide high quality prescription products to healthcare providers in the United States. Their nationwide sales target more than 30,000 OB/GYNS and selected other medical specialties. Their managed markets division will target PBM's, HMO, GPO, CMS and other managed care organizations ensuring their products are covered under drug benefit plans.

The Ultimate Polymer Delivery System.






























Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc.


Skinvisible, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is an R&D pharmaceutical company that develops enhanced, patent protected dermatology and healthcare products including products to treat acne, skin cancers, eczema, fungal infections, inflammation, warts and dermatitis along with sunscreens, anti-aging products, 
		
alcohol-free hand sanitizing lotions, pre-surgical preparations, and various other medical treatments using its patented technology Invisicare�.  Skinvisible's primary objective is to license these prescription and over-the-counter products into the $65 billion global dermatology market and other medical markets. Potential licensees include international and multi-national pharmaceutical, cosmetic, skincare and consumer goods companies seeking new products, product enhancements or life cycle management for their existing products. Click here to see current licensees.

The Technology:  Invisicare� is a patented technology that enhances how drugs are delivered on, in or through the skin.  It can control the release of active ingredients, providing a greater and longer release, while at the same time reducing irritation to the skin.  It also binds products to the skin for 4 hours and more, resisting wash-off and rub-off.   Skinvisible has developed a portfolio of 40+ topical products using Invisicare (prescription, over-the-counter and cosmeceutical) and also works directly with companies to enhance their products, especially ones coming off patent. Invisicare can be tailored to almost any type of molecule and the needs our customers. Learn more at www.invisicare.com.

Intellectual Property:  Skinvisible's value lies in its ability to continually generate new IP on dermatology and medical products formulated with Invisicare. Patent approvals are sought in the U.S. and internationally for all products developed. Skinvisible has fourteen patents granted, including comprehensive patents on Invisicare, the foundation of all of our products; three in the US, and internationally in Canada, Europe (4), China, India, Australia, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, Skinvisible has been granted three product specific patents in the US for dermal barrier products, sunscreens (photostability of avobenzone) and retinoids (stabilization). There are a number of U.S. and international (PCT) patents pending, with many more patent applications in progress. Some of these patents cover up to five products. All patents with Invisicare are owned by Skinvisible.   
Click here to learn more about our patents. 

The Opportunity:   Pharmaceutical companies pursue new or improved revenue streams along with protecting their own patented products. New product formulations are expensive and time intensive for companies to undertake.  Invisicare allows companies to sell a patent-protected product that has been revitalized with new benefits, providing a new story to help combat generic competitors. A perscription dermatology product can generate $100+ million per year; many even more - that's why a pharmaceutical company's investment into an Invisicare formulated product is a very viable option.
