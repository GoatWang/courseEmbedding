FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

          1. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.
	
	
	       
					Please note that you will be charged an additional fee for any SMAs held in your account. These fees are in addition to the basic advisory fees for Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios. Please refer to your Client Agreement for detailed fee information.


          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

          4. Fidelity Personal Trust refers to trust services that are offered through Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank.
	
    

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.


Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios is a service of Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company, and may be offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., or Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB ("FPTC"), a federal savings bank. Nondeposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and its affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

Best Online Brokers

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]




Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston


Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]

Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]

Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]




Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston


Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

	The purpose of the Meeting is set forth in the accompanying Notice. The solicitation is being made primarily by the mailing of this Proxy Statement and the
	accompanying proxy on or about January 22, 2008. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail, telephone, telegraph, facsimile, electronic means or by
	personal interview by representatives of the


	trusts. In addition, D.F. King & Co., Inc. may be paid on a per-call basis to solicit shareholders by telephone on
	behalf of the funds in the trusts. The funds also may also arrange to have votes recorded by telephone. D.F. King & Co., Inc. may be paid on a per-call basis for
	vote-by-phone solicitations on behalf of the funds. The approximate anticipated total cost of these services is detailed in Appendix B.


	If the funds record votes by telephone or through the internet, they will use procedures designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow
	shareholders to authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded.
	Proxies voted by telephone or through the internet may be revoked at any time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by mail may be
	revoked.


	The expenses in connection with preparing this Proxy Statement and its enclosures and all solicitations will be paid by each fund and class, as applicable,


	provided the expenses do not exceed any existing expense caps. See Appendix C for current expense cap information. Expenses exceeding an expense cap will
	be paid by FMR.


	The funds will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of shares.
	The costs are allocated among the funds based upon the number of shareholder accounts in each fund.


	The costs are allocated on a pro rata basis to each class
	of a fund based on the net assets of each class relative to the total net assets of the fund.


	The principal business address of FMR, each fund's investment adviser and administrator, and FMR Co., Inc. (FMRC), sub-adviser to each fund, is 245
	Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The principal business address of Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), each fund's principal underwriter
	and distribution agent, is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02109. Fidelity Management & Research (U.K.) Inc. (FMR U.K.), located at 25 Lovat
	Lane, London, EC3R 8LL, England; Fidelity Research & Analysis Company (FRAC), located at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210; Fidelity

	located at 25 Cannon Street, London, England EC4M5TA are also sub-advisers to the funds.


	If the enclosed proxy is executed and returned, or an internet or telephonic vote is delivered, that vote may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its
	use by written notification received by a trust, by the execution of a later-dated proxy, by a trust's receipt of a subsequent valid internet or telephonic vote, or by
	attending the Meeting and voting in person.


	<R>All proxies solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly executed and received by a fund's Secretary prior to the Meeting, and are not revoked,
	will be voted at the Meeting. Shares represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon. If no specification is made on a
	properly executed proxy, it will be voted FOR Proposals 1 and 2 and AGAINST Proposal 3. All shares that are voted and votes to ABSTAIN will be counted
	towards establishing a quorum, as will broker non-votes. (Broker non-votes are shares for which (i) the beneficial owner has not voted and (ii) the broker
	holding the shares does not have discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter.)</R>


	With respect to fund shares held in Fidelity individual retirement accounts (including Traditional, Rollover, SEP, SARSEP, Roth and SIMPLE IRAs), the IRA
	Custodian will vote those shares for which it has received instructions from shareholders only in accordance with such instructions. If Fidelity IRA
	shareholders do not vote their shares, the IRA Custodian will vote their shares for them, in the same proportion as other Fidelity IRA shareholders have voted.


	<R>If a quorum is not present at a Meeting, or if a quorum is present at a Meeting but sufficient votes to approve any proposal are not received, or if other
	matters arise requiring shareholder attention, the persons named as proxy agents may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further
	solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present at the Meeting or represented by proxy.
	When voting on a proposed adjournment, the persons named as proxy agents will vote FOR the proposed adjournment all shares that they are entitled to vote
	with respect to each item, unless directed to vote AGAINST an item, in which case such shares will be voted AGAINST the proposed adjournment with respect
	to that item. However, if sufficient votes to achieve quorum on Proposal 3 have not been received, the persons named as proxy agents may vote in favor of a
	proposed adjournment with respect to that item. A shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the items in this Proxy Statement prior to such
	adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it is otherwise appropriate.</R>

	proportion as certain other shareholders have voted.</R>


	Shareholders of record at the close of business on January 22, 2008 will be entitled to vote at the Meeting. Each such shareholder will be entitled to one

	1. TO ELECT A BOARD OF TRUSTEES.




	<R>The purpose of this proposal is to elect a Board of Trustees in connection with creating a two-Board structure for the Fidelity family of funds. You have
	received this proxy statement because you own one or more Fidelity equity and/or high income funds and you are being asked to elect a Board of Trustees to
	oversee your funds.</R>


	<R>Fidelity's mutual fund business and the broader mutual fund marketplace continue to expand and evolve. As a result, the Trustees of the Fidelity funds,
	together with FMR, have been considering ways to structure the Board for each Fidelity fund in order to ensure that Fidelity's mutual fund shareholders continue to be
	well served by Trustees in the years ahead. Historically, the Board of each Fidelity fund has consisted of the same group of individual Trustees who serve as Trustees
	for all other Fidelity funds. In effect, the Fidelity funds have been overseen by a single Board of Trustees. The Trustees of the Fidelity funds - with the support of FMR -
	have made a decision to reorganize themselves into two separate groups and thereby create two Boards. One Board will oversee Fidelity's equity and high income
	funds (214 funds with approximate assets of over $877 billion as of November 30, 2007), while the second Board will oversee Fidelity's investment-grade bond,
	money market, and asset allocation funds (156 funds with approximate assets of over $477 billion as of November 30, 2007).</R>


	<R>In connection with creating two Boards, a slate of Trustees must be put in place to oversee each group of funds (the funds and trusts were aligned by
	investment discipline in June 2007). Some existing Trustees and Advisory Board members are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the equity and high
	income funds, while the others are proposed to serve on the Board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds. In some cases, the two Boards can be
	created by having one existing Trustee resign and the remaining Trustees fill the vacancy. In the majority of cases, however, the 1940 Act requires that a
	shareholder meeting be held to elect Trustees. </R>


	The Trustees, with the support of FMR, made the decision to create a two-Board structure in order to plan for the future, and based their decision on three
	specific factors. First, Fidelity's mutual fund business continues to diversify into new asset classes and product types. For example, over the past few years,
	Fidelity has expanded its product line of multi-asset class funds that invest in a variety of asset classes such as preferred stocks, REITs, inflation-protected
	securities, floating-rate securities, and commodities. In addition, lifecycle funds and other types of packaged solutions continue to grow in popularity. As
	greater numbers of individuals continue to save for, and transition into, retirement, the Trustees and FMR expect an increased demand for innovative products.


	Second, as the securities marketplace has evolved in recent years, increasingly complex investment strategies are available to Fidelity's mutual funds. For
	example, the fixed income marketplace has significantly expanded with new types of securities including different types of futures, options, and swaps, and that trend
	is likely to continue.


	Finally, given prevailing demographic and business trends, the Trustees and FMR expect that Fidelity's mutual fund business will continue to expand in the
	future. In recent years, Fidelity has made efforts to position the firm as the most trusted provider of lifetime investment solutions in the U.S. At the same time,
	the amount of assets held by Americans over age sixty is projected to increase dramatically between now and 2012 as the Baby Boomer generation nears and
	enters retirement. The Trustees and FMR believe this provides a significant growth opportunity for Fidelity's business and for the mutual fund industry as a
	whole. Increased interest in principal preservation and income distribution is expected to drive asset growth in Fidelity's fixed income funds and asset
	allocation products, in particular.


	The two-Board structure will be implemented at the same time for all Fidelity funds. On August 1, 2008, or, if later, immediately after the last election is held
	for any Fidelity fund scheduled to elect Trustees in connection with implementing a two-Board structure, the following will occur: Current Trustees will remain
	on the Boards to which they have been elected or appointed and resign from the Boards on which they will no longer serve. Former Advisory Board members
	that have been elected or appointed as Trustees will join the Boards on which they will serve going forward. The size of the Board that will oversee the equity
	and high income funds will be fixed at 10 Trustees, and the size of the Board that will oversee the fixed income and asset allocation funds will be fixed at 8
	Trustees. The Trustees fully expect that the environment of strong governance of the funds and protection of the interests of fund shareholders will continue
	under the new structure.






	<R>Except for Alan J. Lacy, Joseph Mauriello,


	David M. Thomas, and Michael E. Wiley, all nominees for the equity and high income Board are currently
	Trustees of the trusts and have served in that capacity continuously since originally elected or appointed. James C. Curvey was selected by the trusts'
	Governance and Nominating Committee (see page

	<Click Here>

	) and was appointed to the Board on May 17, 2007. Alan J. Lacy, Joseph Mauriello, David M.
	Thomas, and Michael E. Wiley are currently Members of the Advisory Board of the trusts. Alan J. Lacy, Joseph Mauriello, David M. Thomas, and Michael E.
	Wiley were selected by the trusts' Governance and Nominating Committee and were appointed as Members of the Advisory Board effective January 1, 2008
	(Mr. Lacy), July 1, 2007 (Mr. Mauriello), and October 1, 2007 (Messrs. Thomas and Wiley). A third-party search firm retained by the Independent Trustees
	recommended Messrs. Lacy, Mauriello, Thomas, and Wiley. An executive officer of FMR recommended Mr. Curvey as a nominee.</R>


	<R>Except for James C. Curvey, each of the nominees that currently is Trustee of the trusts oversees 373 funds advised by FMR or an affiliate. Mr. Curvey
	oversees 368 funds advised by FMR or an affiliate. </R>


	In the election of Trustees, those nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present, shall be elected.

	* Except as otherwise indicated, each individual has held the office shown or other offices in the same company for the last five years.


	As of November 30, 2007, the Trustees and nominees for election as Trustees and the officers of each fund owned, in the aggregate, less than 1% of each
	fund's outstanding shares.


	<R>During the period February 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007, the holders of Voting Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock of FMR Corp.
	approved the mandatory conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock into a proportionate amount of Non-Voting Common Stock, cash, and an
	interest-bearing promissory note. The conversion did not change the number of shareholders and did not result in a change in proportionate ownership among
	the shareholders. In transactions during the period February 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007, a trust for the benefit of Edward C. Johnson 3d and
	members of his family sold 1,347,747 shares of FMR Corp. securities to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University, Children's Medical Center and
	Fidelity Non-Profit Management Foundation for the aggregate cash consideration of $279,550,000. FMR Corp. merged with and into FMR LLC on October 1,
	2007.</R>


	If elected, the Trustees will hold office without limit in time except that (a) any Trustee may resign; (b) any Trustee may be removed by written instrument,
	signed by at least two-thirds of the number of Trustees prior to such removal; (c) any Trustee who requests to be retired or who has become incapacitated by
	illness or injury may be retired by written instrument signed by a majority of the other Trustees; and (d) a Trustee may be removed at any special meeting of
	shareholders by a two-thirds vote of the outstanding voting securities of the trust. Each Independent Trustee shall retire not later than the last day of the
	calendar year in which his or her 72

	nd

	birthday occurs. The Independent Trustees may waive this mandatory retirement age policy with respect to individual
	Trustees. In case a vacancy shall for any reason exist, the remaining Trustees will fill such vacancy by appointing another Trustee, so long as, immediately after
	such appointment, at least two-thirds of the Trustees have been elected by shareholders. If, at any time, less than a majority of the Trustees holding office has
	been elected by the shareholders, the Trustees then in office will promptly call a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing a Board of Trustees.
	Otherwise, there will normally be no meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees. Advisory Board Members hold office without limit in time
	except that any Advisory Board Member may resign or may be removed by a vote of a majority of the Trustees at any regular meeting or any special meeting of
	the Trustees.


	<R>Each trust's Board, which is currently composed of 2 Interested Trustees and 9 Independent Trustees, met 11 times (10 times for the funds with fiscal
	years ended December 31, 2007) during each fund's most recent fiscal year (see Appendix A for a list of the funds' fiscal year ends). Following the
	implementation of the two-Board structure for all Fidelity funds, it is expected that the Trustees of the equity and high income Board will initially include 2
	interested and 8 Independent Trustees, and will meet at least 9 times a year at regularly scheduled meetings. For information on the current and proposed
	standing committees of the funds' Trustees, refer to the section entitled "Standing Committees of the Funds' Trustees" beginning on page

	The dollar range of equity securities beneficially owned as of December 31, 2007 by each nominee in each fund and in all funds in the aggregate within the
	same fund family overseen or to be overseen by the nominee is included in Appendix F.


	Trustee compensation information for each fund covered by this proxy statement is included in Appendix G.






	<R>

	2. TO AMEND THE DECLARATION OF TRUST TO REDUCE THE REQUIRED QUORUM FOR FUTURE SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS.


	</R>


	<R>Each funds' Declaration of Trust currently provides that a majority of the shares entitled to vote shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a
	shareholders' meeting. As amended, each Declaration of Trust (Article VIII, Section 3) would reduce the quorum required to one-third of the shares entitled to
	vote.</R>


	<R>Lowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters necessary for the conduct of a trust's
	business, such as the election of Trustees. When not enough shareholders vote, a trust may be forced to adjourn meetings multiple times and incur the expense
	of additional shareholder solicitations and proxy solicitors in order to obtain the shareholder vote necessary to hold a meeting. The reduced quorum
	requirement is not prohibited by Massachusetts or federal law.</R>


	<R>Although the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than a majority of the
	outstanding shares, certain other proposals will still require a higher number of shares to be voted to meet the threshold required to approve the proposal. For
	example, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) requires that certain items, such as management contracts and 12b-1 plans, be approved by a
	majority of a fund's outstanding voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, the vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" means the affirmative vote of
	the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting or represented by proxy if the holders of more than 50% of the
	outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities. The reduced quorum requirement
	will not affect such matters.</R>


	<R>Shareholders have the right to vote on any Declaration of Trust amendment affecting their right to vote or on any matter submitted to the shareholders by
	the Trustees. On May 17, 2007, the Trustees approved the proposed amendment and also authorized its submission to each trust's shareholders for their approval
	at this Meeting.</R>


	<R>If approved, Article VIII, Section 3 of each Declaration of Trust will be amended as follows (new language is underlined; language to be deleted is
	[bracketed]): </R>


	<R>

	ARTICLE VIII

	SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING POWERS AND MEETINGS

	</R>


	<R>

	QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE

	</R>


	<R>Section 3.

	Except when a higher quorum is required by any provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, one-third

	[A majority] of Shares entitled
	to vote in person or by proxy shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a Shareholders' meeting, except that where any provision of law or of this
	Declaration of Trust permits or requires that holders of any Series or Class shall vote as a Series or Class then

	one-third

	[a majority] of the aggregate number of
	Shares of that Series or Class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that Series or Class. Any lesser
	number shall be sufficient for adjournments. Any adjourned session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after the date set for the original
	meeting, without the necessity of further notice. Except when a larger vote is required by applicable law or by any provision of this Declaration of Trust or the
	Bylaws, if any, a majority of the Shares voted in person or by proxy shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a Trustee, provided that where any
	provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust permits or requires that the holders of any Series or Class shall vote as a Series or Class, then a majority of the
	Shares of that Series or Class voted on the matter shall decide that matter insofar as that Series or Class is concerned. Shareholders may act by unanimous
	written consent. Actions taken by a Series or Class may be consented to unanimously in writing by Shareholders of that Series or Class.</R>


	<R>

	Conclusion.

	The Board of Trustees of each trust has concluded that the proposal will benefit the trust and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
	voting FOR the proposal. The amended Declaration of Trust will become effective upon shareholder approval. If the proposal is not approved by shareholders of
	a trust, the Declaration of Trust will remain unchanged.</R>






	<R>

	3. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL CONCERNING "OVERSIGHT PROCEDURES TO SCREEN OUT INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT, IN THE
	JUDGMENT OF THE BOARD, SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO GENOCIDE, PATTERNS OF EXTRAORDINARY AND EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF
	HUMAN RIGHTS, OR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY."


	</R>


	<R>Certain shareholders of Fidelity Capital & Income Fund, Fidelity Contrafund, Fidelity Growth & Income Portfolio, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund,
	Fidelity Puritan Fund, Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio, Select Health Care Portfolio, and Fidelity Utilities Fund (for purposes of Proposal 3, each a
	"Fund") have advised the Funds that they intend to present the following shareholder proposal at the Meeting. For the reasons set forth after the proposal, the
	Board of Trustees recommends a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. No Fund is responsible for the contents of the proposal or the supporting statements. A Fund
	will provide the names, addresses, and shareholdings (to the Fund's knowledge) of the proponents of a shareholder proposal upon written request sent to the
	Secretary of the Fund, attention "Fund Shareholder Meetings," 82 Devonshire Street, Mailzone V10A, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, or by calling
	1-617-563-9021.</R>


	<R>WHEREAS:</R>


	<R>Fidelity portfolio managers make their investment decisions based on business and financial considerations, and seem to ignore other issues unless
	they conflict with legal standards. Even in the face of the most egregious violations of human rights, apparently no ethical guidelines regulate Fidelity portfolio
	manager's investment choices.</R>


	<R>As of August 2007, Fidelity was one of the world's largest holders of PetroChina shares. We believe PetroChina's closely related parent, the China
	National Petroleum Company, is providing funding the Government of Sudan's military needs to conduct genocide in Darfur.</R>


	<R>Thus, ordinary individuals, through their investments in Fidelity, inadvertently invest in companies funding genocide. Since no policy prevents these
	investments, holdings in these problem companies may increase or involve new offerings in the future.</R>


	<R>In a 2007 study by KRC Research, 71% of respondents said companies should take extreme cases of human rights abuses such as genocide into
	account rather than base investment decisions solely on economic criteria.</R>


	<R>In our opinion Fidelity has become a symbol of investor irresponsibility by refusing to consider even extreme ethical issues when making investment
	decisions. Its damaged reputation can impact employee morale, increase its cost to acquire customers, reduce the shareholder base for distributing expenses,
	and diminish the value of shareholder investments.</R>


	<R>There is no compelling reason to invest in companies that fund genocide. There are ample alternative opportunities for investment and the firm's
	returns are more impacted by overall asset allocation, sector, and style choices than the individual companies selected.</R>


	<R>Repeated attempts to engage Fidelity on this issue have not resulted in policy changes or recognized standards of ethical responsibility.</R>


	<R>Stock divestment has proven effective at modifying policies of foreign governments. For example, the campaign against Talisman Energy contributed
	to the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement between Khartoum and South Sudan.</R>


	<R>RESOLVED:</R>


	<R>In order to ensure that Fidelity is an ethically managed company that respects the spirit of international law and is a responsible member of society,
	shareholders request that the Board institute oversight procedures to screen out investments in companies that, in the judgment of the Board, substantially
	contribute to genocide, patterns of extraordinary and egregious violations of human rights, or crimes against humanity. </R>


	<R>DISCUSSION:</R>


	<R>This resolution requests procedures to avoid future investments in companies complicit in genocide. Funds with existing investments in problem
	companies have two acceptable options. If the holding is substantial enough that the fund can effectively influence the problem company's management and
	the company is receptive to engagement then this may be appropriate, if the holding is relatively small or the problem company does not respond adequately to
	engagement efforts, then shares should be sold.</R>


	<R>

	Statement of Opposition

	</R>


	<R>The Fidelity Funds Board of Trustees recommends that you vote "AGAINST" this proposal.</R>


	<R>Fidelity, as investment adviser to the Fund, seeks to achieve the best investment results for the Fund consistent with the stated investment policies of
	the Fund. In doing so, Fidelity is obligated to limit the Fund's investments to holdings that are lawful under the laws of the United States. The Fidelity Funds
	Board of Trustees has procedures in place to review Fidelity's performance as investment adviser to the Fund, including the Fund's compliance with all
	applicable laws. </R>


	<R>United States law prohibits investments in companies owned or controlled by the government of Sudan. FMR is committed to complying fully with
	these investment sanctions and any additional investment sanctions that the United States government might enact with respect to companies doing business
	in Sudan or any other country. </R>


	<R>The Fidelity Funds Board of Trustees recognizes and respects that investors, including those investing in this Fund, have other investment
	opportunities open to them should they wish to avoid investments in certain companies or countries. Shareholders of the Fund, however, have chosen to invest
	in this Fund based on its specific stated investment policies. If adopted, this proposal would limit investments by the Fund that would be lawful under the laws
	of the United States. For this reason, the Board of Trustees recommends that you vote "AGAINST" this proposal. </R>



	OTHER BUSINESS



	The Board knows of no other business to be brought before the Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Meeting, it is the intention
	that proxies that do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons therein
	designated.

	STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE FUNDS' TRUSTEES



	Correspondence intended for each Independent Trustee may be sent to the attention of the individual Trustee or to the Board of Trustees at Fidelity Investments,
	P.O. Box 55235, Boston, Massachusetts 02205-5235. Correspondence intended for each Interested Trustee may be sent to the attention of the individual Trustee or to
	the Board of Trustees at Fidelity Investments, 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02109. The current process for collecting and organizing shareholder
	communications requires that the Board of Trustees receive copies of all communications addressed to it. All communications addressed to the Board of Trustees or
	any individual Trustee are logged and sent to the Board or individual Trustee. The funds do not hold annual meetings and therefore do not have a policy with regard to
	Trustees' attendance at such meetings. However, as a matter of practice, at least one Trustee attends special meetings.


	The Board of Trustees has established various committees to support the Independent Trustees in acting independently in pursuing the best interests of the
	Fidelity funds and their shareholders. The committees facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of all matters of importance to Independent Trustees, each
	fund, and fund shareholders and facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, the Board of Trustees has 12 standing committees.
	The members of each committee are Independent Trustees. In connection with implementing a two-Board structure, it is expected that the equity and high
	income Board will have a similar committee structure, except that the Board will not have the following two committees: Fixed-Income Contract and Fund
	Oversight: Fixed-Income and Asset Allocation. See Appendix H for the number of meetings each standing committee held during each fund's last fiscal year.


	The Operations Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently serving as Chair. The committee normally meets
	monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair, and serves as a forum for consideration of issues of importance to, or calling for particular
	determinations by, the Independent Trustees. The committee also considers matters involving potential conflicts of interest between the funds and FMR and its
	affiliates and reviews proposed contracts and the proposed continuation of contracts between the Fidelity funds and FMR and its affiliates, and annually
	reviews and makes recommendations regarding contracts with third parties unaffiliated with FMR, including insurance coverage and custody agreements. The
	committee also monitors additional issues including the nature, levels and quality of services provided to shareholders, significant litigation, and the voting of
	proxies of portfolio companies. The committee also has oversight of compliance issues not specifically within the scope of any other committee. The
	committee is also responsible for definitive action on all compliance matters involving the potential for significant reimbursement by FMR.


	The Fair Value Oversight Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently serving as Chair. The committee
	normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the Chair. The Fair Value Oversight Committee monitors and establishes policies concerning
	procedures and controls regarding the valuation of fund investments and monitors matters of disclosure to the extent required to fulfill its statutory
	responsibilities. The committee also reviews actions taken by FMR's Fair Value Committee.






	<R>The Board of Trustees has established three Fund Oversight Committees: the Equity I Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair) and Mr. Dirks), the
	Equity II Committee (composed of Messrs. Stavropoulos (Chair) and Lautenbach), and the Fixed-Income and Asset Allocation Committee (composed Messrs.
	Wolfe (Chair), Gamper, and Keyes, Dr. Heilmeier and Ms. Knowles). Each committee normally meets in conjunction with in-person meetings of the Board of
	Trustees, or more frequently as called by the Chair of the respective committee. Each committee develops an understanding of and reviews the investment
	objectives, policies, and practices of each fund under its oversight. Each committee also monitors investment performance, compliance by each relevant
	Fidelity fund with its investment policies and restrictions and reviews appropriate benchmarks, competitive universes, unusual or exceptional investment
	matters, the personnel and other resources devoted to the management of each fund and all other matters bearing on each fund's investment results. The


	Fixed-Income and Asset Allocation Committee also receives reports required under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and has oversight of research bearing on credit
	quality, investment structures and other fixed-income issues. The Equity I Committee has oversight of FMR's equity investment research. Each committee will
	review and recommend any required action to the Board in respect of specific funds, including new funds, changes in fundamental and non-fundamental
	investment policies and restrictions, partial or full closing to new investors, fund mergers, fund name changes, and liquidations of funds. The members of each
	committee may organize working groups to make recommendations concerning issues related to funds that are within the scope of the committee's review. These
	working groups report to the committee or to the Independent Trustees, or both, as appropriate. Each working group may request from FMR such information
	from FMR as may be appropriate to the working group's deliberations. Prior to November 2007, the three Fund Oversight Committees were the Equity Committee;
	the Fixed-Income, International, and Special Committee; and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee.</R>


	<R>The Board of Trustees has established two Fund Contract Committees: the Equity Contract Committee (composed of Messrs. Stavropoulos (Chair), Dirks,
	Lautenbach, and Ms. Small) and the Fixed-Income Contract Committee (composed of Messrs. Wolfe (Chair), Gamper, and Keyes, Dr. Heilmeier, and Ms. Knowles).
	Each committee will ordinarily meet as needed to consider matters related to the renewal of fund investment advisory agreements. The committees will assist the
	Independent Trustees in their consideration of investment advisory agreements of each fund. Each committee receives information on and makes recommendations
	concerning the approval of investment advisory agreements between the Fidelity funds and FMR and its affiliates and any non-FMR affiliate that serves as a
	sub-adviser to a Fidelity fund (collectively, "investment advisers") and the annual review of these contracts. The Fixed-Income Contract Committee is responsible for
	investment advisory agreements of the fixed-income and asset allocation funds. The Equity Contract Committee is responsible for the investment advisory
	agreements of all other funds. With respect to each fund under its purview, each committee: requests and receives information on the nature, extent, and quality of
	services provided to the shareholders of the Fidelity funds by the investment advisers and their respective affiliates, fund performance, the investment
	performance of the investment adviser, and such other information as the committee determines to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the
	investment advisory agreements; considers the cost of the services to be provided and the profitability and other benefits that the investment advisers and their
	respective affiliates derive or will derive from their contractual arrangements with each of the funds (including tangible and intangible "fall-out benefits");
	considers the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the funds grow and whether fee levels reflect those economies of scale for the benefit of
	fund investors; considers methodologies for determining the extent to which the funds benefit from economies of scale and refinements to these methodologies;
	considers information comparing the services to be rendered and the amount to be paid under the funds' contracts with those under other investment advisory
	contracts entered into with FMR and its affiliates and other investment advisers, such as contracts with other registered investment companies or other types of
	clients; considers such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate to evaluate investment advisory agreements of the funds; and makes
	recommendations to the Board concerning the approval or renewal of investment advisory agreements. Each committee will consult with the other committees of
	the Board of Trustees, and in particular with the Audit Committee and the applicable Fund Oversight Committees, in carrying out its responsibilities. Each
	committee's responsibilities are guided by Sections 15(c) and 36(b) of the 1940 Act. While each committee consists solely of Independent Trustees, its meetings
	may, depending upon the subject matter, be attended by one or more senior members of FMR's management or representatives of a sub-adviser not affiliated with
	FMR.</R>


	The Shareholder, Distribution and Brokerage Committee is composed of Messrs. Dirks (Chair), Gamper, and Stavropoulos, and Ms. Small. The committee
	normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair. Regarding shareholder services, the committee considers the structure and
	amount of the Fidelity funds' transfer agency fees and fees, including direct fees to investors (other than sales loads), such as bookkeeping and custodial fees,
	and the nature and quality of services rendered by FMR and its affiliates or third parties (such as custodians) in consideration of these fees. The committee also
	considers other non-investment management services rendered to the Fidelity funds by FMR and its affiliates, including pricing and bookkeeping services.
	Regarding brokerage, the committee monitors and recommends policies concerning the securities transactions of the Fidelity funds. The committee
	periodically reviews the policies and practices with respect to efforts to achieve best execution, commissions paid to firms supplying research and brokerage
	services or paying fund expenses, and policies and procedures designed to assure that any allocation of portfolio transactions is not influenced by the sale of
	Fidelity fund shares. The committee also monitors brokerage and other similar relationships between the Fidelity funds and firms affiliated with FMR that
	participate in the execution of securities transactions. Regarding the distribution of fund shares, the committee considers issues bearing on the various
	distribution channels employed by the Fidelity funds, including issues regarding Rule 18f-3 plans and related consideration of classes of shares, sales load
	structures (including breakpoints), load waivers, selling concessions, and service charges paid to intermediaries, Rule 12b-1 plans, contingent deferred sales
	charges, and finders' fees, and other means by which intermediaries are compensated for selling fund


	shares or providing shareholder servicing, including
	revenue sharing. The committee also considers issues bearing on the preparation and use of advertisements and sales literature for the Fidelity funds, policies
	and procedures regarding frequent purchase of Fidelity fund shares, and selective disclosure of portfolio holdings.


	The Audit Committee is composed of Ms. Knowles (Chair), Dr. Heilmeier, and Messrs. Keyes and Wolfe. All committee members must be able to read and
	understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. At least one committee
	member will be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The committee will have at least one
	committee member in common with the Compliance Committee. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the
	Chair. The committee meets separately at least four times a year with the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, with personnel responsible for the internal audit function of
	FMR LLC, and with the Fidelity funds' outside auditors. The committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work
	of the outside auditors employed by the Fidelity funds. The committee assists the Trustees in overseeing and monitoring: (i) the systems of internal accounting
	and financial controls of the Fidelity funds and the funds' service providers, (ii) the financial reporting processes of the Fidelity funds, (iii) the independence,
	objectivity, and qualification of the auditors to the Fidelity funds, (iv) the annual audits of the Fidelity funds' financial statements, and (v) the accounting policies
	and disclosures of the Fidelity funds. The committee considers and acts upon (i) the provision by any outside auditor of any non-audit services for any Fidelity
	fund, and (ii) the provision by any outside auditor of certain non-audit services to Fidelity fund service providers and their affiliates to the extent that such
	approval (in the case of this clause (ii)) is required under applicable regulations of the SEC. In furtherance of the foregoing, the committee has adopted (and
	may from time to time amend or supplement) and provides oversight of policies and procedures for non-audit engagements by outside auditors of the Fidelity
	funds. It is responsible for approving all audit engagement fees and terms for the Fidelity funds, resolving disagreements between a fund and any outside
	auditor regarding any fund's financial reporting, and has sole authority to hire and fire any auditor. Auditors of the funds report directly to the committee. The
	committee will obtain assurance of independence and objectivity from the outside auditors, including a formal written statement delineating all relationships
	between the auditor and the Fidelity funds and any service providers consistent with Independent Standards Board Standard No. 1. The committee will receive
	reports of compliance with provisions of the Auditor Independence Regulations relating to the hiring of employees or former employees of the outside
	auditors. It oversees and receives reports on the Fidelity funds' service providers' internal controls and reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the service
	providers' accounting and financial controls, including: (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
	financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Fidelity funds' ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data; (ii) any change in
	the fund's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the fund's internal control over financial
	reporting; and (iii) any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Fidelity funds' or service
	providers' internal controls over financial reporting. The committee will review with counsel any legal matters that may have a material impact on the Fidelity funds'
	financial statements and any material reports or inquiries received from regulators or governmental agencies. These matters may also be reviewed by the
	Compliance Committee or the Operations Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee will coordinate with the Chair of the Compliance Committee, as
	appropriate. The committee reviews at least annually a report from each outside auditor describing any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality
	control, peer review, or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examination of the auditing firm and any material issues raised by any inquiry or
	investigation by governmental or professional authorities of the auditing firm and in each case any steps taken to deal with such issues. The committee will
	oversee and receive reports on the Fidelity funds' financial reporting process, will discuss with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditors and, if
	appropriate, internal audit personnel of FMR LLC their qualitative judgments about the appropriateness and acceptability of accounting principles and financial
	disclosure practices used or proposed for adoption by the Fidelity funds, and will review with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditor, and internal
	auditor personnel of FMR LLC (to the extent relevant) the results of audits of the Fidelity funds' financial statements. The committee will review periodically the
	Fidelity funds' major internal controls exposures and the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposures.




	The Governance and Nominating Committee is composed of Messrs. Lautenbach (Chair), Stavropoulos, and Wolfe. The committee meets as called by the
	Chair. A current copy of the Governance and Nominating Committee Charter With Respect to Nominations of Independent Trustees is available on Fidelity's
	website (www.fidelity.com) and is attached as Exhibit 1 to this proxy

	.

	With respect to fund governance and board administration matters, the committee
	periodically reviews procedures of the Board of Trustees and its committees (including committee charters) and periodically reviews compensation of
	Independent Trustees. The committee monitors corporate governance matters and makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees on the frequency and
	structure of the Board of Trustee meetings and on any other aspect of Board procedures. It acts as the administrative committee under the retirement plan for
	Independent Trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996 and under the fee deferral plan for Independent Trustees. It reviews the performance of legal
	counsel employed by the Fidelity funds and the Independent Trustees. On behalf of the Independent Trustees, the committee will make such findings and
	determinations as to the independence of counsel for the Independent Trustees as may be necessary or appropriate under applicable regulations or otherwise.
	The committee is also responsible for Board administrative matters applicable to Independent Trustees, such as expense reimbursement policies and
	compensation for attendance at meetings, conferences and other events. The committee monitors compliance with, acts as the administrator of, and makes
	determinations in respect of, the provisions of the code of ethics and any supplemental policies regarding personal securities transactions applicable to the
	Independent Trustees. The committee monitors the functioning of each Board committee and makes recommendations for any changes, including the creation
	or elimination of standing or ad hoc Board committees. The committee monitors regulatory and other developments to determine whether to recommend
	modifications to the committee's responsibilities or other Trustee policies and procedures in light of rule changes, reports concerning "best practices" in
	corporate governance and other developments in mutual fund governance. The committee meets with Independent Trustees at least once a year to discuss
	matters relating to fund governance. The committee recommends that the Board establish such special or ad hoc Board committees as may be desirable or
	necessary from time to time in order to address ethical, legal, or other matters that may arise. The committee also oversees the annual self-evaluation of the
	Board of Trustees and establishes procedures to allow it to exercise this oversight function. In conducting this oversight, the committee shall address all
	matters that it considers relevant to the performance of the Board of Trustees and shall report the results of its evaluation to the Board of Trustees, including
	any recommended amendments to the principles of governance, and any recommended changes to the Fidelity funds' or the Board of Trustees' policies,
	procedures, and structures. The committee reviews periodically the size and composition of the Board of Trustees as a whole and recommends, if necessary,
	measures to be taken so that the Board of Trustees reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and diversity required for the
	Board as a whole and contains at least the minimum number of Independent Trustees required by law. The committee makes nominations for the election or
	appointment of Independent Trustees and non-management Members of any Advisory Board, and for membership on committees. The committee shall have
	authority to retain and terminate any third-party advisers, including authority to approve fees and other retention terms. Such advisers may include search
	firms to identify Independent Trustee candidates and board compensation consultants. The committee recently retained a third-party search firm, which
	received a fee to compile a list of candidates based upon criteria established by the Independent Trustees. The committee may conduct or authorize
	investigations into or studies of matters within the committee's scope of responsibilities, and may retain, at the Fidelity funds' expense, such independent
	counsel or other advisers as it deems necessary. The committee will consider nominees to the Board of Trustees recommended by shareholders based upon
	the criteria applied to candidates presented to the committee by a search firm or other source. Recommendations, along with appropriate background material
	concerning the candidate that demonstrates his or her ability to serve as an Independent Trustee of the Fidelity funds, should be submitted to the Chair of the
	committee at the address maintained for communications with Independent Trustees. If the committee retains a search firm, the Chair will generally forward all
	such submissions to the search firm for evaluation. With respect to the criteria for selecting Independent Trustees, it is expected that all candidates will possess
	the following minimum qualifications: (i) unquestioned personal integrity; (ii) not an interested person of FMR or its affiliates within the meaning of the 1940
	Act; (iii) does not have a material relationship (e.g., commercial, banking, consulting, legal, or accounting) that could create an appearance of lack of
	independence in respect of FMR and its affiliates; (iv) has the disposition to act independently in respect of FMR and its affiliates and others in order to protect
	the interests of the funds and all shareholders; (v) ability to attend 11 meetings per year; (vi) demonstrates sound business judgment gained through broad
	experience in significant positions where the candidate has dealt with management, technical, financial, or regulatory issues; (vii) sufficient financial or
	accounting knowledge to add value in the complex financial environment of the Fidelity funds; (viii) experience on corporate or other institutional oversight
	bodies having similar responsibilities, but which board memberships or other relationships could not result in business or regulatory conflicts with the funds;
	and (ix) capacity for the hard work and attention to detail that is required to be an effective Independent Trustee in light of the Fidelity funds' complex regulatory,
	operational, and marketing setting. The Governance and Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have the type of previous
	experience or knowledge referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Governance and Nominating Committee finds that the
	candidate has additional qualifications such that his or her qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate the same level of fitness to serve as an Independent
	Trustee.


	The Board of Trustees established the Compliance Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair), Ms. Knowles, and Messrs. Stavropoulos and Wolfe) in May
	2005. The committee normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the Chair. The committee oversees the administration and operation of the
	compliance policies and procedures of the Fidelity funds and their service providers as required by Rule 38a-1 of the 1940 Act. The committee is responsible
	for the review and approval of policies and procedures relating to (i) provisions of the Code of Ethics, (ii) anti-money laundering requirements, (iii) compliance
	with investment restrictions and limitations, (iv) privacy, (v) recordkeeping, and (vi) other compliance policies and procedures which are not otherwise
	delegated to another committee. The committee has responsibility for recommending to the Board the designation of a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) of the
	Fidelity funds. The committee serves as the primary point of contact between the CCO and the Board, it oversees the annual performance review and
	compensation of the CCO, and if required, makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the removal of the appointed CCO. The committee receives
	reports of significant correspondence with regulators or governmental agencies, employee complaints or published reports which raise concerns regarding
	compliance matters, and copies of significant non-routine correspondence with the SEC. The committee receives reports from the CCO including the annual
	report concerning the funds' compliance policies as required by Rule 38a-1, quarterly reports in respect of any breaches of fiduciary duty or violations of
	federal securities laws, and reports on any other compliance or related matters that may have a significant impact on the funds. The committee will recommend
	to the Board, what actions, if any, should be taken with respect to such reports.


	The Proxy Voting Committee is composed of Messrs. Gamper (Chair), Dirks, and Keyes. The committee will meet as needed to review the fund's proxy
	voting policies, consider changes to the policies, and review the manner in which the policies have been applied. The committee will receive reports on the
	manner in which proxy votes have been cast under the proxy voting policies and reports on consultations between the fund's investment advisers and portfolio
	companies concerning matters presented to shareholders for approval. The committee will address issues relating to the fund's annual voting report filed with
	the SEC. The committee will receive reports concerning the implementation of procedures and controls designed to ensure that the proxy voting policies are
	implemented in accordance with their terms. The committee will consider FMR's recommendations concerning certain non-routine proposals not covered by
	the proxy voting policies. The committee will receive reports with respect to steps taken by FMR to assure that proxy voting has been done without regard to any
	other FMR relationships, business or otherwise, with that portfolio company. The committee will make recommendations to the Board concerning the casting of
	proxy votes in circumstances where FMR has determined that, because of a conflict of interest, the proposal to be voted on should be reviewed by the Board. The
	Board of Trustees established the current Proxy Voting Committee in January 2006.



	INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS



	The firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) or Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates
	(collectively, "Deloitte Entities"), has been selected as the independent registered public accounting firm for the funds, as indicated in Appendix A. PwC and
	Deloitte Entities, in accordance with Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (ISB No.1), have confirmed to the Audit Committee of each trust, as
	applicable, that they are the independent registered public accounting firms with respect to the funds.


	The independent registered public accounting firm examines annual financial statements for the funds and provides other audit-related, non-audit, and
	tax-related services to the funds. Representatives of PwC and Deloitte Entities


	are not expected to be present at the Meeting, but have been given the opportunity to
	make a statement if they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring their presence.


	Each trust's Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firms relating to
	the operations or financial reporting of the funds. Prior to the commencement of any audit or non-audit services to a fund, the Audit Committee reviews the
	services to determine whether they are appropriate and permissible under applicable law.


	Each trust's Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures to, among other purposes, provide a framework for the Audit Committee's consideration
	of non-audit services by the audit firms that audit the Fidelity funds. The policies and procedures require that any non-audit service provided by a fund audit
	firm to a Fidelity fund and any non-audit service provided by a fund auditor to FMR and entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FMR
	(not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser) that
	provide ongoing services to the funds ("Fund Service Providers") that relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of a Fidelity fund (Covered
	Service) are subject to approval by the Audit Committee before such service is provided. Non-audit services provided by a fund audit firm for a Fund Service
	Provider that do not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of a Fidelity fund (Non-Covered Service)


	but that are expected to exceed $50,000
	are also subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee.


	All Covered Services, as well as Non-Covered Services that are expected to exceed $50,000, must be approved in advance of provision of the service either: (i)
	by formal resolution of the Audit Committee, or (ii) by oral or written approval of the service by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or if the Chair is unavailable, such
	other member of the Audit Committee as may be designated by the Chair to act in the Chair's absence). The approval contemplated by (ii) above is permitted where
	the Treasurer determines that action on such an engagement is necessary before the next meeting of the Audit Committee. Neither pre-approval nor advance
	notice of Non-Covered Service engagements for which fees are not expected to exceed $50,000 is required; such engagements are to be reported to the Audit
	Committee monthly.


	Each trust's Audit Committee has considered Non-Covered Services that were not pre-approved that were provided by PwC and Deloitte Entities to Fund
	Service Providers to be compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC and Deloitte Entities in their audit of the funds, taking into account
	representations from PwC and Deloitte Entities, in accordance with ISB No.1, regarding their independence from the funds and their related entities.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE                                                             
DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Although there have been some positive market indications so far in 1995,       
no one can predict what lies ahead for investors. Last year, stocks posted      
below-average returns and bonds had one of the worst years in history. This     
downturn followed a period in which the investing environment was generally     
very positive.                                                                  
These market ups and downs are a normal part of investing, and there are        
some basic principles that are helpful for investors to remember in             
different types of markets.                                                     
If you can leave your money invested over the long term, you can avoid the      
results of the volatility that generally accompanies the stock market in        
the short term, as we witnessed last year. You also can help to manage some     
of the risks of investing through diversification. A stock fund is already      
diversified because it invests in many issues. You can diversify even           
further by placing some of your money in several different types of stock       
funds or in other investment categories, such as bonds.                         
If you have a short investment time horizon, you might want to consider         
moving some of your investment into a money market fund, which seeks income     
and a stable share price by investing in high-quality, short-term               
investments. Of course, there is no assurance that a money market fund will     
achieve its goal, and it is important to remember that money market funds       
are not insured or guaranteed by any agency of the U.S. government.             
Finally, no matter what your investment horizon or portfolio diversity, it      
makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan - investing a certain      
amount of money at the same time each month or quarter - and to review your     
portfolio periodically. A periodic investment plan will not, of course,         
assure a profit or protect against a loss.                                      
If you have any questions, please call us at 1-800-544-8888. We stand ready     
to provide the information you need to make the investments that are right      
for you.                                                                        
Best regards,

PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate a fund's historical performance. You can     
look at the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage     
change, or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Each                
performance figure includes changes in a fund's share price, plus               
reinvestment of any dividends (or income) and capital gains (the profits        
the fund earns when it sells stocks that have grown in value).                  
CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms        
over a set period - in this case, one year, or since the fund started on        
March 29, 1994. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5%     
return over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050.        
You can compare the fund's returns to the performance of the Standard &         
Poor's MidCap 400 Index - a broad measure of the performance of the mid-cap     
market. To measure how the fund's performance stacked up against its peers,     
you can compare it to the average mid-cap fund, which reflects the              
performance of 82 funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper               
Analytical Services over the past 12 months. Both benchmarks include            
reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any.

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS take the fund's actual (or cumulative) return      
and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a            
constant rate each year.

$10,000 OVER LIFE OF FUND:  Let's say you invested $10,000 in Fidelity          
Mid-Cap Stock Fund on March 29, 1994, when the fund started. As the chart       
shows, by April 30, 1995, the value of your investment would have grown to      
$12,196 - a 21.96% increase on your initial investment. For comparison,         
look at how the S&P MidCap 400 Index did over the same period. With             
dividends reinvested, the same $10,000 investment in the S&P MidCap 400         
Index would have grown to $10,652 - a 6.52% increase.

How a fund did yesterday is                                                     
no guarantee of how it will do                                                  
tomorrow. The stock market,                                                     
for example, has a history of                                                   
growth in the long run and                                                      
volatility in the short run. In                                                 
turn, the share price and                                                       
return of a fund that invests in                                                
stocks will vary. That means if                                                 
you sell your shares during a                                                   
market downturn, you might                                                      
lose money. But if you can                                                      
ride out the market's ups and

A rally starting in January 1995 -

about future interest rate increases                                            
and solid corporate earnings -

economic growth calmed inflation

An interview with Jennifer Uhrig, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity                 
Mid-Cap Stock Fund                                                              
Q. JENNIFER, HOW HAS THE FUND PERFORMED?                                        
A. It has done very well. For the 12 months ended April 30, 1995, the fund      
had a total return of 23.94%. That beat the average mid cap stock fund,         
which returned 9.62% over the same period, according to Lipper Analytical       
Services.                                                                       
Q. WHAT HELPED THE FUND OUTPERFORM THE LIPPER AVERAGE BY SUCH A LARGE           
MARGIN?                                                                         
A. The fund has done well due to good stock selection and positive results      
from investments in the technology and finance sectors.                         
Q. WHAT WERE THE STORIES THERE?                                                 
A. Earnings in the technology sector have been driven by businesses' desire     
to increase productivity, as well as the growth in sales of personal            
computers to consumers. The fund's technology stake - 25.5% of the fund's       
investments at the end of the period - includes Novell, a networking            
software company; Dynatech, a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment;     
and Symantec, a company that provides utility software such as antivirus        
and back-up programs for personal computers. Microsoft is introducing a new     
operating system, Windows 95, that will need new associated utilities           
software, so I expect Symantec will benefit from this product cycle.            
Q. AND FINANCE?                                                                 
A. The fund benefited from underweighting these stocks relative to the          
Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index in the first half of the period when         
they underperformed, and increasing the weighting over the second half when     
they performed well. Two of the fund's investments, Fannie Mae and Freddie      
Mac - the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan       
Mortgage Corporation, respectively - have performed well recently for two       
reasons. First, the interest rate environment has started to improve. The       
spread between the rate at which these agencies borrow and the rate at          
which they lend has begun to increase to more profitable levels. Second,        
the availability of fixed-rate mortgages for them to purchase has               
increased. I've also increased the fund's investment in Fleet Financial         
Group. It is acquiring Shawmut Bank, a move I believe will help Fleet to        
consolidate costs and increase market share in New England. I also find         
Fleet's stock to be inexpensive.                                                
Q. WHAT STOCKS HAVEN'T PERFORMED AS WELL AS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED?               
A. Talbots, an apparel retailer - hasn't done badly, but its performance        
has lagged the market. The company has a strong niche, but its stock hasn't     
been able to make much headway in an environment where retail apparel           
stocks have performed poorly. One of the reasons behind these struggles has     
been that too much capacity, or square footage, has been added over the         
past 10 years. That means that too many stores are competing for consumer       
dollars. In addition, some theorize that retail apparel sales have suffered     
from the fact that more companies are allowing their employees to dress         
casually on Fridays. As a result, people are buying fewer business clothes      
and more casual clothes, which cost less and don't provide the apparel          
companies with as much profit as items such as suits. Another                   
underperformer, RJR Nabisco; has been under pressure from the threat of         
legal issues in the tobacco industry, and so hasn't performed that well,        
although the stock price has moved up recently. In any event, I still own       
both Talbots and RJR Nabisco because they're good values and have the           
potential to perform well going forward.                                        
Q. THE FUND'S ASSETS HAVE GROWN QUICKLY OVER THE PERIOD. HOW DOES THAT          
AFFECT YOUR MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND?                                             
A. In general, I try to buy more of the stocks I already own and feel           
confident about. I'd like to keep the number of stocks in the fund to a         
manageable number. In addition, I have to work harder                           
to find new stock ideas that meet my standards.                                 
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK GOING FORWARD?                                           
A. It's possible that the positive investing environment could continue         
over the next six months, particularly since recent statistics, including       
unemployment numbers, indicate the economy is slowing down. This reduces        
the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates         
again to slow inflation. On the other hand, I am concerned that the market      
may not be able to keep up its current pace and that many stocks are            
becoming expensive. I'll continue to look for stocks that are                   
under-recognized and avoid chasing stocks that are becoming over-priced.

JENNIFER UHRIG ON THE EFFECT OF                                                 
THE WEAK DOLLAR:

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING                                                       
POLICIES.                                                                       
Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Devonshire         
Trust (the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares.     
The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as            
amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company            
organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On March 16, 1995, the Board       
of Trustees approved a change in the fiscal year-end of the fund to April
30, 1995. Accordingly, the financial statements of the fund are presented       
for the three-month period ended April 30, 1995. The following summarizes       
the significant accounting policies of the fund:                                
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are readily        
available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale price, at the        
closing bid price. Securities for which exchange quotations are not readily     
available (and in certain cases debt securities which trade on an               
exchange), are valued primarily using dealer-supplied valuations or at          
their fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied         
procedures under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.              
Short-term securities maturing within sixty days of their purchase date are     
valued at amortized cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of        
which approximate current value.                                                
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and          
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period end. Purchases and        
sales of securities, income receipts, and expense payments are translated       
into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate on the respective dates       
of the transactions.                                                            
Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent        
net gains and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency              
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses         
realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions,     
and the difference between the amount of net investment income accrued and      
the U.S. dollar amount actually received. Further, as permitted under the       
SOP, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on               
investments in securities are not segregated in the Statement of Operations     
from the effects of changes in market prices of those securities, but are       
included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investment        
securities.                                                                     
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to      
the extent that it distributes all of its taxable income for the fiscal         
year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding income         
taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."                               
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date,         
except certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date     
may have passed, are recorded as soon as                                        
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING                                                       
POLICIES - CONTINUED                                                            
INVESTMENT INCOME - CONTINUED                                                   
the fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Interest income is accrued as     
earned. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where       
recovery of such taxes is uncertain.                                            
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.      
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the        
funds in the trust.                                                             
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date.                                                               
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles. These differences, which may result in distribution                 
reclassifications, are primarily due to differing treatments for market         
discount and futures and options transactions. The fund also utilized           
earnings and profits distributed to shareholders on redemption of shares as     
a part of the dividends paid deduction for income tax purposes.                 
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital and may       
affect the per-share allocation between net investment income and realized      
and unrealized gain loss. Undistributed net investment income and               
accumulated undistributed net realized gain (loss) on investments may           
include temporary book and tax basis differences which will reverse in a        
subsequent period. Distributions in excess of net investment income and         
accumulated undistributed net realized gain (loss) on investments may           
include temporary book and tax basis differences that will reverse in a         
subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end      
is distributed in the following year.                                           
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS. The fund may use foreign currency           
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign securities and to manage        
the fund's currency exposure. Contracts to buy generally are used to            
acquire exposure to foreign currencies, while contracts to sell are used to     
hedge the fund's investments against currency fluctuations. Also, a             
contract to buy or sell can offset a previous contract. Losses may arise        
from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if the counterparties      
do not perform under the contracts' terms.                                      
The U.S. dollar value of forward foreign currency contracts is determined       
using forward currency exchange rates supplied by a quotation service.          
Purchases and sales of forward foreign currency contracts having the same       
settlement date and broker are offset and any realized gain (loss) is           
recognized on the date of offset; otherwise, gain (loss) is recognized on       
settlement date.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES -                                                         
CONTINUED                                                                       
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the fund, along with other        
affiliated entities of Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR), may        
transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more joint trading accounts.      
These balances are invested in one or more repurchase agreements that           
mature in 60 days or less from the date of purchase, and are collateralized     
by U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                                 
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The fund, through its custodian, receives delivery       
of the underlying securities, whose market value is required to be at least     
102% of the resale price at the time of purchase. FMR, the fund's               
investment adviser, is responsible for determining that the value of these      
underlying securities remains at least equal to the resale price.               
FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS. The fund may use futures and options             
contracts to manage its exposure to the stock and bond markets and to           
fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. Buying futures, writing     
puts, and buying calls tend to increase the fund's exposure to the              
underlying instrument. Selling futures, buying puts, and writing calls tend     
to decrease the fund's exposure to the underlying instrument, or hedge          
other fund investments. Losses may arise from changes in the value of the       
underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for the        
contracts, or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'         
terms.                                                                          
Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day       
by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Exchange-traded     
options are valued using the last sale price or, in the absence of a sale,      
the last offering price. Options traded over-the-counter are valued using       
dealer-supplied valuations.                                                     
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF                                                       
INVESTMENTS.                                                                    
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $371,291,863 and $102,759,065, respectively, of which U.S.           
government and government agency obligations aggregated $6,992,480 and          
$2,997,630, respectively.                                                       
The market value of futures contracts opened and closed during the period       
amounted to $25,254,095 and $25,752,380, respectively.                          
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As each fund's investment adviser, Fidelity Management &        
Research Company (FMR) receives a monthly basic fee that is calculated on       
the basis of a group fee rate plus a fixed individual fund fee rate applied     
to the average net assets of each fund. The group fee rate is the weighted      
average of a series of rates and is based on the monthly average net assets     
of all the mutual funds advised by FMR. The rates ranged from .2700% to         
.5200%. In the event that these rates were lower than the contractual rates   
in effect during the period, FMR voluntarily implemented the                    
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES - CONTINUED                      
MANAGEMENT FEE - CONTINUED                                                      
above rates, as they resulted in the same or a lower management fee. The        
annual individual fund fee rate is .30%. The basic fee is subject to a          
performance adjustment (up to a maximum of (plus/minus) .20%) based on each     
fund's investment performance as compared to the appropriate index over a       
specified period of time. The funds' performance adjustment took effect in      
March 1995. For the period, the management fees were equivalent to an           
annualized rate of .66% of average net assets.                                  
TRANSFER AGENT FEES. Fidelity Service Co. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, is        
the fund's transfer, dividend disbursing and shareholder servicing agent.       
During the period March 29, 1994 (commencement of operations) to December
31, 1994, FSC received fees based on the type, size, number of accounts and     
the number of transactions made by shareholders. Effective January 1, 1995,     
the Board of Trustees approved a revised transfer agent contract pursuant       
to which FSC receives account fees and asset-based fees that vary according     
to account size and type of account. FSC pays for typesetting, printing and     
mailing of all shareholder reports, except proxy statements.                    
ACCOUNTING FEES. FSC maintains the fund's accounting records. The fee is        
based on the level of average net assets for the month plus out-of-pocket       
expenses.                                                                       
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. The fund placed a portion of its portfolio               
transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of FMR. The              
commissions paid to these affiliated firms were $145,249 for the period.        
5. BANK BORROWINGS.                                                             
The fund is permitted to have bank borrowings for temporary or emergency        
purposes to fund shareholder redemptions. The fund has established              
borrowing arrangements with certain banks. Under the most restrictive           
arrangement, the fund must pledge to the bank securities having a market        
value in excess of 220% of the total bank borrowings. The interest rate on      
the borrowings is the bank's base rate, as revised from time to time. The       
maximum loan and the average daily loan balances during the periods for         
which loans were outstanding amounted to $5,543,000 and $5,543,000              
respectively. The weighted average interest rate was 6.438%.Interest            
expense includes $2,974 paid under the bank borrowing program.                  
6. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
FMR has directed certain portfolio trades to brokers who paid a portion of      
the fund's expenses. For the period, the fund's expenses were reduced by        
$23,521 under this arrangement.                                                 
All expenses in connection with the fiscal year end change including audit    
fees, amounting to $14,000, will be reimbursed by FMR.                          
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

To the Trustees of Fidelity Devonshire Trust and the Shareholders of            
Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund:                                                    
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of         
Fidelity Devonshire Trust: Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund, including the           
schedule of investments, as of April 30, 1995, and the related statement of     
operations for the period February 1, 1995 to April 30, 1995, the statement     
of changes in net assets and the financial highlights for the period            
February 1, 1995 to April 30, 1995 and for the period March 29, 1994            
(commencement of operations) to January 31, 1995. These financial               
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the fund's        
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements based on our audits.                                                 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free     
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,         
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial                
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of      
April 30, 1995 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. An audit       
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant          
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable         
basis for our opinion.                                                          
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred      
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position       
of Fidelity Devonshire Trust: Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund as of April 30,
1995, the results of its operations for the period February 1, 1995 to          
April 30, 1995, the changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights     
for the period February 1, 1995 to April 30, 1995 and for the period March
29, 1994 (commencement of operations) to January 31, 1995, in conformity        
with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Board of Trustees of Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund voted to pay on June
5, 1995 to shareholders of record at the opening of business on June 2,
1995, a distribution of $.01 derived from capital gains realized from sales     
of portfolio securities and a dividend of $.16 from net investment income.      
A total of 19% of the dividends distributed during the fiscal year              
qualifies for the dividends-received deductions for corporate shareholders.     
The fund will notify shareholders in January of the applicable percentage       
for use in preparing 1995 income tax returns.
