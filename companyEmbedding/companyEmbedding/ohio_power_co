Service Details & FAQ 







							Frequently Asked Questions

							Answers to common questions. Choose a topic from below:



Who is XOOM Energy?


Read 






XOOM Energy is an independent energy retailer who, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, supplies natural gas, electricity, and renewable energy to residential and commercial customers in deregulated energy markets (product offerings vary by state).









Where does XOOM Energy offer service in the U.S.?


Read 






XOOM Energy has wholly owned subsidiaries offering natural gas and electricity service in 18 states across the U.S. Totaling 80+ utilities – making XOOM Energy one of the largest energy retailers in the country.









Is my electricity or natural gas service ever at risk by enrolling with XOOM Energy?


Read 






No.  You are never at risk of not having service by enrolling with XOOM Energy.  XOOM Energy is required to post collateral with each utility, and in the unlikely event XOOM Energy was not able to service your account, the utility would procure and deliver energy to your home or business on XOOM Energy's behalf.









What is an energy supplier?


Read 






An energy supplier is a company that acquires its electricity, renewable energy or natural gas supplies from the wholesale market and is licensed to sell it retail to homes and business.   Wholesale energy supply sources include much of the same source that the utility will use, such as electricity generators or the open market.  An energy supplier is not your local utility. The utility still operates the local distribution wires and pipes which carry electricity and natural gas through its territory and to homes or businesses. An energy supplier purchases and supplies energy, the local utility, delivers the energy to your home.









What utilities does XOOM Energy service in Ohio?


Read 






Currently, XOOM Energy Ohio, LLC supplies natural gas throughout the Dominion East of Ohio, Duke Energy, Columbia of Ohio and Vectren territories. XOOM Energy supplies electricity throughout AEP Ohio, Dayton Power and Light Co., Duke Energy, Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), Toledo Edison (FirstEnergy) and The Illuminating Company (FirstEnergy).









What is energy deregulation?


Read 






Energy deregulation has been around for more than two decades in certain states and is designed to ensure consumers have access to adequate and competitively priced energy supplies.  While your local utility is still responsible for maintaining the wires, pipes and infrastructure that make up the distribution system, reading your meter and responding to emergencies, the utility no longer holds a monopoly on the energy service. Customers have the ability to choose from multiple competitive retailers that offer various service plans at competing rates.









Will I be switching utilities?


Read 






No. Your local utility will remain the same and will continue to deliver energy to your home or business just like they did when you bought the energy supply from them.









Will my service be interrupted when I switch service suppliers?


Read 






No. You are never at risk for service disruptions for switching to XOOM Energy. In fact, you will see no difference in the service you are receiving. The only change will be in your billing, which will be according to the service plan contract rate you selected.









Are there monthly fees?


Read 






All fees are outlined and explained in the Terms and Conditions that accompany each service plan.









What is the difference between fixed and variable rate plans?


Read 






A fixed rate plan provides you with stability and peace of mind. A fixed rate product may be higher or lower than utility rates, but, unlike utility rates, a fixed rate product will not change during the life of your contract. You are protected against unexpected and costly price increases and have greater control over the cost of your gas.   A variable rate plan allows you to purchase gas at market-based prices that change from month to month. While a variable rate is subject to monthly price increases or decreases, it may help you realize the lowest possible cost in the market. However, it also exposes you to potential price increases, and, unlike a fixed rate, a variable rate does not protect you against price volatility.  Variable rate plans may be higher or lower than the utility rate.









Why do I have to pay a cost recovery fee if I cancel?


Read 






For XOOM Energy to offer and fulfill its term obligation to you, we have to purchase energy in advance of usage to cover the entire length of your contract.  If you cancel your contract early, XOOM Energy needs to offset the cost of selling the unused portion of your energy to others. The cost recovery fee covers this cost and any other expenses we incur because of your cancellation.









When will my service become effective with XOOM Energy?


Read 






XOOM Energy service will typically commence on your meter read date immediately following your successful enrollment in our program, meaning it may take up to 30 days. In some cases, it may become active upon the second-meter read following your enrollment. In this case, it may take up to 60 days before your service commences.









How will I be billed?


Read 






You will receive your bill directly from the utility.  XOOM Energy supply charges will appear along with your utility service and delivery charges.









Does XOOM Energy offer Budget Billing?


Read

What happens once I complete the enrollment process online?


Read 






Once you complete the enrollment process online, you will receive a confirmation e-mail containing your confirmation number, the summary of your order and other information detailing your service with XOOM Energy.  Once the utility accepts enrollment, your service will be switched to XOOM Energy.









Can I upgrade to a different program?


Read 






Some of XOOM Energy's service plan contracts, but not all, allow you to switch to another service plan contract within the term of the contract, so you need to read carefully and understand the service plan contract you select.









What is renewable energy?


Read 






Renewable energy is energy produced from sources that have less of a negative impact on the environment compared to fossil fuels.









What are the advantages of renewable energy?


Read 






Green energy can supply a significant proportion of the country’s energy needs, which has many benefits such as, environmental improvement, an increase of fuel diversity and regional economic development.









How do I know XOOM Energy is truly providing renewable energy?


Read

These disclosure labels are often limited to the system mix and for those enrolled in a renewable energy program, they may not include the additional, voluntary, renewable energy associated with your product.









Why does renewable energy cost more?


Read 






Renewable energy costs more than traditional energy due to limited resources and availability of renewable energy at this time.









What happens if I move?


Read

American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.
AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000 km) network that includes 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined.[4] AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas.
AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345 kV transmission lines which took place in 1953.
AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.[5][6]

Subsidiaries[edit]
The company is divided into seven major geographic local operating companies:
AEP Ohio[edit]
AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers in central, southern and northwestern Ohio. For years, it consisted of two operating companies, Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power. However, in 2014, Columbus Southern was merged into Ohio Power, leaving Ohio Power as the legal operating company for regulatory purposes.
AEP Texas[edit]
AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997. It consists of AEP Texas North Company (formerly West Texas Utilities), which operates in west Texas, and AEP Texas Central Company (formerly Central Power and Light), which operates in south Texas.[7][8]
Appalachian Power[edit]
Appalachian Power (AP) is based in Charleston, West Virginia and owns the naming rights to Appalachian Power Park in Charleston. AP serves about one million customers in parts of central and Southern West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and parts of Northeast Tennessee, specifically Kingsport. Cities in the Appalachian Power service territory include Wheeling, Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia; Roanoke, Virginia and Kingsport.
Until the 21st century, AEP's operations in Tennessee were part of a separate operating company, Kingsport Power Company. However, since the turn of the millennium, Kingsport Power's operations have been almost completely merged with those of Appalachian Power, and AEP considers Appalachian Power to be the operating company in the Kingsport area. While Kingsport Power still legally exists, the Kingsport Power name is almost never used anymore except for regulatory formality.
Wheeling Power, based in Wheeling, West Virginia, was long treated as a de facto part of Ohio Power, but is now reckoned as part of Appalachian Power.
Indiana Michigan Power[edit]
Indiana Michigan Power serves northeastern and east central Indiana, including Muncie and Fort Wayne; and parts of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan, including South Bend, St. Joseph, Benton Harbor and Three Rivers.
Kentucky Power[edit]
Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. Kentucky Power is currently headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky but announced on July 13, 2016 that they were moving their state headquarters to Ashland, Kentucky by January 1, 2017.[9]
Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)[edit]
PSO was one of the four CSW operating companies when CSW merged with AEP.[10] Incorporated in 1913, PSO serves approximately 540,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma. Its headquarters are in Tulsa. PSO has 4,269 megawatts of generating capacity and provides electricity to 232 cities and towns across a service area encompassing 30,000 square miles.[11]
In April, 2014, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law an AEP-backed bill that would add a tax onto anyone in the state who adopted rooftop solar.[12] This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race.[13]
Southwestern Electric Power Company[edit]
Often called SWEPCO, the Southwestern Electric Power Company serves most of western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. Like PSO, it was one of the four CSW Operating Companies.[10]
Between 2013 and 2014, AEP, under subsidiary SWEPCO, tried to eliminate a fundamental solar policy, net metering, at the LPSC several times, and failed each time. SWEPCO also backed openly anti-solar candidate Eric Skrmetta, who has been widely criticized for receiving 2/3 of his campaign contributions from entities he regulates.[14]
In Arkansas, SWEPCO is expected in 2015 to ask regulators to allow them to pass along the costs of building and running the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, the most expensive project in state history, to Arkansas ratepayers. This process is expected to elicit similar controversy to what has plagued the plant since construction.[15]
Other subsidiaries[edit]
AEP also bought much of the town of Cheshire, Ohio, where the Gavin Power Plant is located, due to pollution issues.[16] In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP.[17]
The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas.
In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets.[18]
It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.
Nuclear[edit]
AEP owns and operates the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant. This accounts for 6% of the generation portfolio.
Hybrid technology[edit]
AEP is expanding its green efforts to include 18 more International DuraStar hybrid diesel trucks.[19] AEP is also teaming with Ford for the integration of a Vehicle-To-Power grid communication system, which allows hybrid vehicles to communicate with power companies to determine where, how long, and what it would cost to re-charge a hybrid during travel.[20]
Solar and wind energy[edit]
AEP recently[when?] signed a deal with Wyandot Solar LLC to purchase power from one of the largest solar fields in the eastern United States of America, based in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.[21]
AEP owns and operates the Desert Sky Wind Farm and the Trent Wind Farm.[22]
In 2009, AEP partnered with other energy companies in commissioning a study of how to transmit wind energy generated in the Upper Midwest to consumers in the East.[23]
AEP currently gets .02% of its energy from renewable energy resources like wind and solar.[24] They are planning to increase their reliance on coal in the next five years.[25] They occasionally support renewable energy in their utility territories, but only when they can own it through their regulated assets.
PATH Proposal[edit]
In 2007, AEP teamed with Allegheny Energy to propose the US$1.8 billion[26][27] (changed to US$2.1 billion in 2011[28]) Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH), a 290-mile (470 km), 765  kilovolt transmission line that would run through West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. According to Joe Denault, a volunteer spokesperson for the proposal, the PATH proposal would incorporate new technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 380,000 short tons (340,000 t) a year; allow for the transmission of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric; and generate 5,700 jobs, with $420 million in employee compensation annually.[29] However, many of these claims are disputed[30] and the proposal must pass several legal hurdles before moving forward.[31] On August 24, 2012, PJM Interconnection officially removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans, citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use.[32]
History[edit]
The American Gas and Electric Company, which would be renamed American Electric Power in 1958, was incorporated in 1906.[33] It replaced Electric Company of America, a holding company that had existed since 1899. It built "the first plant in the world to reheat steam to do double duty in the process of generating electricity"[33] at Philo, Ohio in 1923. Several of its holdings were divested following the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935; these holdings would include Atlantic City Electric (now a subsidiary of Exelon) and Scranton Electric (since absorbed by PPL).[34] However, it retained its Central System, which ran between Michigan and Virginia. It moved its headquarters from New York City to Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. On May 1, 1999, The North American electric power industry tested and cleared 75 percent of the U.S. electricity system for compliance with the Year 2000 computer glitch.[35] On August 31, 2004, American Electric Power Company's $10 billion acquisition of the Central and South West Corporation was approved.[36]
Acquisitions[edit]

1922 Indiana and Michigan Electric
1924 American Electric Power Company, a Philadelphia holding company
1925 Appalachian Power Company
1948 Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne
1980 Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company
1997 Central and South West Corporation (completed in 2000)[37]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 American Electric Power shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[38])
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks American Electric Power 45th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000 t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.[39] Major pollutants include sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and chromium, manganese and nickel compounds.[40] Overall, electric power plants, such as those operated by AEP, account for almost "70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions." Individually, these pollutants cause serious respiratory damage and other illnesses; when combined, they create what's known as acid rain, which causes long term damage to the environment and deterioration of natural and man-made structures.[41] Environmental Protection Agency has named American Electric a potentially responsible party at the Green River Disposal Inc. Superfund toxic waste site.[42]
Justice Department lawsuit[edit]
The United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit on November 3, 1999, against AEP and six other companies for violating the Clean Air Act. On October 8, 2007, AEP agreed to install US$4.6 billion in equipment to reduce emission, as well as pay a US$15 million civil fine and provide US$36 million for environmental projects and $24 million for environmental mitigation.[43][44] The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000 t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed.[45] According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states. The facilities are located in Moundsville (two facilities), St. Albans, Glasgow, and New Haven (two facilities), West Virginia; Louisa, Kentucky; Glen Lyn and Carbo, Virginia; Brilliant, Conesville, Cheshire, Lockbourne, and Beverly, Ohio; and Rockport and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
Political influence[edit]
AEP's political action committee, the American Electric Power Committee for Responsible Government, has increased spending since the 1998 election cycle, reaching $1.4 million in contributions in 2007–2008, 57 percent to Republicans.[46] Also in 2008, American Electric Power significantly increased lobbying expenditures from less than $2 million a year to over $11 million, as climate legislation became a key issue in Washington. As of December 2011, lobbying expenses remained between $6 million and $10 million per year.[47]
In 2009, AEP CEO Michael G. Morris contributed $100,000 to Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future, which supports increased oil drilling and opposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gas pollution.[48] American Electric Power is also a member of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying and marketing organization which opposes President Obama's climate and clean energy legislation.[49]
Paul Loeffelman, AEP director of environmental public policy, served as co-chair of the ALEC Energy, Environment, and Agriculture task force, which in 2012 adopted model legislation entitled the "Electricity Freedom Act", designed to repeal state-level mandates requiring electric utilities to produce some of their electricity from renewable sources.[50] In 2013, ALEC-affiliated legislators introduced bills in 13 states designed to weaken or repeal renewable energy mandates. None of the bills passed in 2013.[51]

American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.
AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000 km) network that includes 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined.[4] AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas.
AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345 kV transmission lines which took place in 1953.
AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.[5][6]

Subsidiaries[edit]
The company is divided into seven major geographic local operating companies:
AEP Ohio[edit]
AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers in central, southern and northwestern Ohio. For years, it consisted of two operating companies, Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power. However, in 2014, Columbus Southern was merged into Ohio Power, leaving Ohio Power as the legal operating company for regulatory purposes.
AEP Texas[edit]
AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997. It consists of AEP Texas North Company (formerly West Texas Utilities), which operates in west Texas, and AEP Texas Central Company (formerly Central Power and Light), which operates in south Texas.[7][8]
Appalachian Power[edit]
Appalachian Power (AP) is based in Charleston, West Virginia and owns the naming rights to Appalachian Power Park in Charleston. AP serves about one million customers in parts of central and Southern West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and parts of Northeast Tennessee, specifically Kingsport. Cities in the Appalachian Power service territory include Wheeling, Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia; Roanoke, Virginia and Kingsport.
Until the 21st century, AEP's operations in Tennessee were part of a separate operating company, Kingsport Power Company. However, since the turn of the millennium, Kingsport Power's operations have been almost completely merged with those of Appalachian Power, and AEP considers Appalachian Power to be the operating company in the Kingsport area. While Kingsport Power still legally exists, the Kingsport Power name is almost never used anymore except for regulatory formality.
Wheeling Power, based in Wheeling, West Virginia, was long treated as a de facto part of Ohio Power, but is now reckoned as part of Appalachian Power.
Indiana Michigan Power[edit]
Indiana Michigan Power serves northeastern and east central Indiana, including Muncie and Fort Wayne; and parts of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan, including South Bend, St. Joseph, Benton Harbor and Three Rivers.
Kentucky Power[edit]
Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. Kentucky Power is currently headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky but announced on July 13, 2016 that they were moving their state headquarters to Ashland, Kentucky by January 1, 2017.[9]
Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)[edit]
PSO was one of the four CSW operating companies when CSW merged with AEP.[10] Incorporated in 1913, PSO serves approximately 540,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma. Its headquarters are in Tulsa. PSO has 4,269 megawatts of generating capacity and provides electricity to 232 cities and towns across a service area encompassing 30,000 square miles.[11]
In April, 2014, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law an AEP-backed bill that would add a tax onto anyone in the state who adopted rooftop solar.[12] This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race.[13]
Southwestern Electric Power Company[edit]
Often called SWEPCO, the Southwestern Electric Power Company serves most of western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. Like PSO, it was one of the four CSW Operating Companies.[10]
Between 2013 and 2014, AEP, under subsidiary SWEPCO, tried to eliminate a fundamental solar policy, net metering, at the LPSC several times, and failed each time. SWEPCO also backed openly anti-solar candidate Eric Skrmetta, who has been widely criticized for receiving 2/3 of his campaign contributions from entities he regulates.[14]
In Arkansas, SWEPCO is expected in 2015 to ask regulators to allow them to pass along the costs of building and running the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, the most expensive project in state history, to Arkansas ratepayers. This process is expected to elicit similar controversy to what has plagued the plant since construction.[15]
Other subsidiaries[edit]
AEP also bought much of the town of Cheshire, Ohio, where the Gavin Power Plant is located, due to pollution issues.[16] In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP.[17]
The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas.
In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets.[18]
It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.
Nuclear[edit]
AEP owns and operates the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant. This accounts for 6% of the generation portfolio.
Hybrid technology[edit]
AEP is expanding its green efforts to include 18 more International DuraStar hybrid diesel trucks.[19] AEP is also teaming with Ford for the integration of a Vehicle-To-Power grid communication system, which allows hybrid vehicles to communicate with power companies to determine where, how long, and what it would cost to re-charge a hybrid during travel.[20]
Solar and wind energy[edit]
AEP recently[when?] signed a deal with Wyandot Solar LLC to purchase power from one of the largest solar fields in the eastern United States of America, based in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.[21]
AEP owns and operates the Desert Sky Wind Farm and the Trent Wind Farm.[22]
In 2009, AEP partnered with other energy companies in commissioning a study of how to transmit wind energy generated in the Upper Midwest to consumers in the East.[23]
AEP currently gets .02% of its energy from renewable energy resources like wind and solar.[24] They are planning to increase their reliance on coal in the next five years.[25] They occasionally support renewable energy in their utility territories, but only when they can own it through their regulated assets.
PATH Proposal[edit]
In 2007, AEP teamed with Allegheny Energy to propose the US$1.8 billion[26][27] (changed to US$2.1 billion in 2011[28]) Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH), a 290-mile (470 km), 765  kilovolt transmission line that would run through West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. According to Joe Denault, a volunteer spokesperson for the proposal, the PATH proposal would incorporate new technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 380,000 short tons (340,000 t) a year; allow for the transmission of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric; and generate 5,700 jobs, with $420 million in employee compensation annually.[29] However, many of these claims are disputed[30] and the proposal must pass several legal hurdles before moving forward.[31] On August 24, 2012, PJM Interconnection officially removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans, citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use.[32]
History[edit]
The American Gas and Electric Company, which would be renamed American Electric Power in 1958, was incorporated in 1906.[33] It replaced Electric Company of America, a holding company that had existed since 1899. It built "the first plant in the world to reheat steam to do double duty in the process of generating electricity"[33] at Philo, Ohio in 1923. Several of its holdings were divested following the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935; these holdings would include Atlantic City Electric (now a subsidiary of Exelon) and Scranton Electric (since absorbed by PPL).[34] However, it retained its Central System, which ran between Michigan and Virginia. It moved its headquarters from New York City to Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. On May 1, 1999, The North American electric power industry tested and cleared 75 percent of the U.S. electricity system for compliance with the Year 2000 computer glitch.[35] On August 31, 2004, American Electric Power Company's $10 billion acquisition of the Central and South West Corporation was approved.[36]
Acquisitions[edit]

1922 Indiana and Michigan Electric
1924 American Electric Power Company, a Philadelphia holding company
1925 Appalachian Power Company
1948 Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne
1980 Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company
1997 Central and South West Corporation (completed in 2000)[37]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 American Electric Power shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[38])
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks American Electric Power 45th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000 t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.[39] Major pollutants include sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and chromium, manganese and nickel compounds.[40] Overall, electric power plants, such as those operated by AEP, account for almost "70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions." Individually, these pollutants cause serious respiratory damage and other illnesses; when combined, they create what's known as acid rain, which causes long term damage to the environment and deterioration of natural and man-made structures.[41] Environmental Protection Agency has named American Electric a potentially responsible party at the Green River Disposal Inc. Superfund toxic waste site.[42]
Justice Department lawsuit[edit]
The United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit on November 3, 1999, against AEP and six other companies for violating the Clean Air Act. On October 8, 2007, AEP agreed to install US$4.6 billion in equipment to reduce emission, as well as pay a US$15 million civil fine and provide US$36 million for environmental projects and $24 million for environmental mitigation.[43][44] The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000 t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed.[45] According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states. The facilities are located in Moundsville (two facilities), St. Albans, Glasgow, and New Haven (two facilities), West Virginia; Louisa, Kentucky; Glen Lyn and Carbo, Virginia; Brilliant, Conesville, Cheshire, Lockbourne, and Beverly, Ohio; and Rockport and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
Political influence[edit]
AEP's political action committee, the American Electric Power Committee for Responsible Government, has increased spending since the 1998 election cycle, reaching $1.4 million in contributions in 2007–2008, 57 percent to Republicans.[46] Also in 2008, American Electric Power significantly increased lobbying expenditures from less than $2 million a year to over $11 million, as climate legislation became a key issue in Washington. As of December 2011, lobbying expenses remained between $6 million and $10 million per year.[47]
In 2009, AEP CEO Michael G. Morris contributed $100,000 to Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future, which supports increased oil drilling and opposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gas pollution.[48] American Electric Power is also a member of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying and marketing organization which opposes President Obama's climate and clean energy legislation.[49]
Paul Loeffelman, AEP director of environmental public policy, served as co-chair of the ALEC Energy, Environment, and Agriculture task force, which in 2012 adopted model legislation entitled the "Electricity Freedom Act", designed to repeal state-level mandates requiring electric utilities to produce some of their electricity from renewable sources.[50] In 2013, ALEC-affiliated legislators introduced bills in 13 states designed to weaken or repeal renewable energy mandates. None of the bills passed in 2013.[51]

American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.
AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000 km) network that includes 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined.[4] AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas.
AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345 kV transmission lines which took place in 1953.
AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.[5][6]

Subsidiaries[edit]
The company is divided into seven major geographic local operating companies:
AEP Ohio[edit]
AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers in central, southern and northwestern Ohio. For years, it consisted of two operating companies, Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power. However, in 2014, Columbus Southern was merged into Ohio Power, leaving Ohio Power as the legal operating company for regulatory purposes.
AEP Texas[edit]
AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997. It consists of AEP Texas North Company (formerly West Texas Utilities), which operates in west Texas, and AEP Texas Central Company (formerly Central Power and Light), which operates in south Texas.[7][8]
Appalachian Power[edit]
Appalachian Power (AP) is based in Charleston, West Virginia and owns the naming rights to Appalachian Power Park in Charleston. AP serves about one million customers in parts of central and Southern West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and parts of Northeast Tennessee, specifically Kingsport. Cities in the Appalachian Power service territory include Wheeling, Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia; Roanoke, Virginia and Kingsport.
Until the 21st century, AEP's operations in Tennessee were part of a separate operating company, Kingsport Power Company. However, since the turn of the millennium, Kingsport Power's operations have been almost completely merged with those of Appalachian Power, and AEP considers Appalachian Power to be the operating company in the Kingsport area. While Kingsport Power still legally exists, the Kingsport Power name is almost never used anymore except for regulatory formality.
Wheeling Power, based in Wheeling, West Virginia, was long treated as a de facto part of Ohio Power, but is now reckoned as part of Appalachian Power.
Indiana Michigan Power[edit]
Indiana Michigan Power serves northeastern and east central Indiana, including Muncie and Fort Wayne; and parts of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan, including South Bend, St. Joseph, Benton Harbor and Three Rivers.
Kentucky Power[edit]
Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. Kentucky Power is currently headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky but announced on July 13, 2016 that they were moving their state headquarters to Ashland, Kentucky by January 1, 2017.[9]
Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)[edit]
PSO was one of the four CSW operating companies when CSW merged with AEP.[10] Incorporated in 1913, PSO serves approximately 540,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma. Its headquarters are in Tulsa. PSO has 4,269 megawatts of generating capacity and provides electricity to 232 cities and towns across a service area encompassing 30,000 square miles.[11]
In April, 2014, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law an AEP-backed bill that would add a tax onto anyone in the state who adopted rooftop solar.[12] This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race.[13]
Southwestern Electric Power Company[edit]
Often called SWEPCO, the Southwestern Electric Power Company serves most of western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. Like PSO, it was one of the four CSW Operating Companies.[10]
Between 2013 and 2014, AEP, under subsidiary SWEPCO, tried to eliminate a fundamental solar policy, net metering, at the LPSC several times, and failed each time. SWEPCO also backed openly anti-solar candidate Eric Skrmetta, who has been widely criticized for receiving 2/3 of his campaign contributions from entities he regulates.[14]
In Arkansas, SWEPCO is expected in 2015 to ask regulators to allow them to pass along the costs of building and running the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, the most expensive project in state history, to Arkansas ratepayers. This process is expected to elicit similar controversy to what has plagued the plant since construction.[15]
Other subsidiaries[edit]
AEP also bought much of the town of Cheshire, Ohio, where the Gavin Power Plant is located, due to pollution issues.[16] In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP.[17]
The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas.
In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets.[18]
It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.
Nuclear[edit]
AEP owns and operates the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant. This accounts for 6% of the generation portfolio.
Hybrid technology[edit]
AEP is expanding its green efforts to include 18 more International DuraStar hybrid diesel trucks.[19] AEP is also teaming with Ford for the integration of a Vehicle-To-Power grid communication system, which allows hybrid vehicles to communicate with power companies to determine where, how long, and what it would cost to re-charge a hybrid during travel.[20]
Solar and wind energy[edit]
AEP recently[when?] signed a deal with Wyandot Solar LLC to purchase power from one of the largest solar fields in the eastern United States of America, based in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.[21]
AEP owns and operates the Desert Sky Wind Farm and the Trent Wind Farm.[22]
In 2009, AEP partnered with other energy companies in commissioning a study of how to transmit wind energy generated in the Upper Midwest to consumers in the East.[23]
AEP currently gets .02% of its energy from renewable energy resources like wind and solar.[24] They are planning to increase their reliance on coal in the next five years.[25] They occasionally support renewable energy in their utility territories, but only when they can own it through their regulated assets.
PATH Proposal[edit]
In 2007, AEP teamed with Allegheny Energy to propose the US$1.8 billion[26][27] (changed to US$2.1 billion in 2011[28]) Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH), a 290-mile (470 km), 765  kilovolt transmission line that would run through West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. According to Joe Denault, a volunteer spokesperson for the proposal, the PATH proposal would incorporate new technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 380,000 short tons (340,000 t) a year; allow for the transmission of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric; and generate 5,700 jobs, with $420 million in employee compensation annually.[29] However, many of these claims are disputed[30] and the proposal must pass several legal hurdles before moving forward.[31] On August 24, 2012, PJM Interconnection officially removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans, citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use.[32]
History[edit]
The American Gas and Electric Company, which would be renamed American Electric Power in 1958, was incorporated in 1906.[33] It replaced Electric Company of America, a holding company that had existed since 1899. It built "the first plant in the world to reheat steam to do double duty in the process of generating electricity"[33] at Philo, Ohio in 1923. Several of its holdings were divested following the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935; these holdings would include Atlantic City Electric (now a subsidiary of Exelon) and Scranton Electric (since absorbed by PPL).[34] However, it retained its Central System, which ran between Michigan and Virginia. It moved its headquarters from New York City to Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. On May 1, 1999, The North American electric power industry tested and cleared 75 percent of the U.S. electricity system for compliance with the Year 2000 computer glitch.[35] On August 31, 2004, American Electric Power Company's $10 billion acquisition of the Central and South West Corporation was approved.[36]
Acquisitions[edit]

1922 Indiana and Michigan Electric
1924 American Electric Power Company, a Philadelphia holding company
1925 Appalachian Power Company
1948 Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne
1980 Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company
1997 Central and South West Corporation (completed in 2000)[37]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 American Electric Power shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[38])
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks American Electric Power 45th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000 t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.[39] Major pollutants include sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and chromium, manganese and nickel compounds.[40] Overall, electric power plants, such as those operated by AEP, account for almost "70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions." Individually, these pollutants cause serious respiratory damage and other illnesses; when combined, they create what's known as acid rain, which causes long term damage to the environment and deterioration of natural and man-made structures.[41] Environmental Protection Agency has named American Electric a potentially responsible party at the Green River Disposal Inc. Superfund toxic waste site.[42]
Justice Department lawsuit[edit]
The United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit on November 3, 1999, against AEP and six other companies for violating the Clean Air Act. On October 8, 2007, AEP agreed to install US$4.6 billion in equipment to reduce emission, as well as pay a US$15 million civil fine and provide US$36 million for environmental projects and $24 million for environmental mitigation.[43][44] The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000 t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed.[45] According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states. The facilities are located in Moundsville (two facilities), St. Albans, Glasgow, and New Haven (two facilities), West Virginia; Louisa, Kentucky; Glen Lyn and Carbo, Virginia; Brilliant, Conesville, Cheshire, Lockbourne, and Beverly, Ohio; and Rockport and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
Political influence[edit]
AEP's political action committee, the American Electric Power Committee for Responsible Government, has increased spending since the 1998 election cycle, reaching $1.4 million in contributions in 2007–2008, 57 percent to Republicans.[46] Also in 2008, American Electric Power significantly increased lobbying expenditures from less than $2 million a year to over $11 million, as climate legislation became a key issue in Washington. As of December 2011, lobbying expenses remained between $6 million and $10 million per year.[47]
In 2009, AEP CEO Michael G. Morris contributed $100,000 to Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future, which supports increased oil drilling and opposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gas pollution.[48] American Electric Power is also a member of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying and marketing organization which opposes President Obama's climate and clean energy legislation.[49]
Paul Loeffelman, AEP director of environmental public policy, served as co-chair of the ALEC Energy, Environment, and Agriculture task force, which in 2012 adopted model legislation entitled the "Electricity Freedom Act", designed to repeal state-level mandates requiring electric utilities to produce some of their electricity from renewable sources.[50] In 2013, ALEC-affiliated legislators introduced bills in 13 states designed to weaken or repeal renewable energy mandates. None of the bills passed in 2013.[51]

American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.
AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000 km) network that includes 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined.[4] AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas.
AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345 kV transmission lines which took place in 1953.
AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.[5][6]

Subsidiaries[edit]
The company is divided into seven major geographic local operating companies:
AEP Ohio[edit]
AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers in central, southern and northwestern Ohio. For years, it consisted of two operating companies, Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power. However, in 2014, Columbus Southern was merged into Ohio Power, leaving Ohio Power as the legal operating company for regulatory purposes.
AEP Texas[edit]
AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997. It consists of AEP Texas North Company (formerly West Texas Utilities), which operates in west Texas, and AEP Texas Central Company (formerly Central Power and Light), which operates in south Texas.[7][8]
Appalachian Power[edit]
Appalachian Power (AP) is based in Charleston, West Virginia and owns the naming rights to Appalachian Power Park in Charleston. AP serves about one million customers in parts of central and Southern West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and parts of Northeast Tennessee, specifically Kingsport. Cities in the Appalachian Power service territory include Wheeling, Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia; Roanoke, Virginia and Kingsport.
Until the 21st century, AEP's operations in Tennessee were part of a separate operating company, Kingsport Power Company. However, since the turn of the millennium, Kingsport Power's operations have been almost completely merged with those of Appalachian Power, and AEP considers Appalachian Power to be the operating company in the Kingsport area. While Kingsport Power still legally exists, the Kingsport Power name is almost never used anymore except for regulatory formality.
Wheeling Power, based in Wheeling, West Virginia, was long treated as a de facto part of Ohio Power, but is now reckoned as part of Appalachian Power.
Indiana Michigan Power[edit]
Indiana Michigan Power serves northeastern and east central Indiana, including Muncie and Fort Wayne; and parts of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan, including South Bend, St. Joseph, Benton Harbor and Three Rivers.
Kentucky Power[edit]
Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. Kentucky Power is currently headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky but announced on July 13, 2016 that they were moving their state headquarters to Ashland, Kentucky by January 1, 2017.[9]
Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)[edit]
PSO was one of the four CSW operating companies when CSW merged with AEP.[10] Incorporated in 1913, PSO serves approximately 540,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma. Its headquarters are in Tulsa. PSO has 4,269 megawatts of generating capacity and provides electricity to 232 cities and towns across a service area encompassing 30,000 square miles.[11]
In April, 2014, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law an AEP-backed bill that would add a tax onto anyone in the state who adopted rooftop solar.[12] This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race.[13]
Southwestern Electric Power Company[edit]
Often called SWEPCO, the Southwestern Electric Power Company serves most of western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. Like PSO, it was one of the four CSW Operating Companies.[10]
Between 2013 and 2014, AEP, under subsidiary SWEPCO, tried to eliminate a fundamental solar policy, net metering, at the LPSC several times, and failed each time. SWEPCO also backed openly anti-solar candidate Eric Skrmetta, who has been widely criticized for receiving 2/3 of his campaign contributions from entities he regulates.[14]
In Arkansas, SWEPCO is expected in 2015 to ask regulators to allow them to pass along the costs of building and running the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, the most expensive project in state history, to Arkansas ratepayers. This process is expected to elicit similar controversy to what has plagued the plant since construction.[15]
Other subsidiaries[edit]
AEP also bought much of the town of Cheshire, Ohio, where the Gavin Power Plant is located, due to pollution issues.[16] In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP.[17]
The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas.
In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets.[18]
It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.
Nuclear[edit]
AEP owns and operates the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant. This accounts for 6% of the generation portfolio.
Hybrid technology[edit]
AEP is expanding its green efforts to include 18 more International DuraStar hybrid diesel trucks.[19] AEP is also teaming with Ford for the integration of a Vehicle-To-Power grid communication system, which allows hybrid vehicles to communicate with power companies to determine where, how long, and what it would cost to re-charge a hybrid during travel.[20]
Solar and wind energy[edit]
AEP recently[when?] signed a deal with Wyandot Solar LLC to purchase power from one of the largest solar fields in the eastern United States of America, based in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.[21]
AEP owns and operates the Desert Sky Wind Farm and the Trent Wind Farm.[22]
In 2009, AEP partnered with other energy companies in commissioning a study of how to transmit wind energy generated in the Upper Midwest to consumers in the East.[23]
AEP currently gets .02% of its energy from renewable energy resources like wind and solar.[24] They are planning to increase their reliance on coal in the next five years.[25] They occasionally support renewable energy in their utility territories, but only when they can own it through their regulated assets.
PATH Proposal[edit]
In 2007, AEP teamed with Allegheny Energy to propose the US$1.8 billion[26][27] (changed to US$2.1 billion in 2011[28]) Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH), a 290-mile (470 km), 765  kilovolt transmission line that would run through West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. According to Joe Denault, a volunteer spokesperson for the proposal, the PATH proposal would incorporate new technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 380,000 short tons (340,000 t) a year; allow for the transmission of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric; and generate 5,700 jobs, with $420 million in employee compensation annually.[29] However, many of these claims are disputed[30] and the proposal must pass several legal hurdles before moving forward.[31] On August 24, 2012, PJM Interconnection officially removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans, citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use.[32]
History[edit]
The American Gas and Electric Company, which would be renamed American Electric Power in 1958, was incorporated in 1906.[33] It replaced Electric Company of America, a holding company that had existed since 1899. It built "the first plant in the world to reheat steam to do double duty in the process of generating electricity"[33] at Philo, Ohio in 1923. Several of its holdings were divested following the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935; these holdings would include Atlantic City Electric (now a subsidiary of Exelon) and Scranton Electric (since absorbed by PPL).[34] However, it retained its Central System, which ran between Michigan and Virginia. It moved its headquarters from New York City to Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. On May 1, 1999, The North American electric power industry tested and cleared 75 percent of the U.S. electricity system for compliance with the Year 2000 computer glitch.[35] On August 31, 2004, American Electric Power Company's $10 billion acquisition of the Central and South West Corporation was approved.[36]
Acquisitions[edit]

1922 Indiana and Michigan Electric
1924 American Electric Power Company, a Philadelphia holding company
1925 Appalachian Power Company
1948 Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne
1980 Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company
1997 Central and South West Corporation (completed in 2000)[37]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 American Electric Power shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[38])
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks American Electric Power 45th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000 t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.[39] Major pollutants include sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and chromium, manganese and nickel compounds.[40] Overall, electric power plants, such as those operated by AEP, account for almost "70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions." Individually, these pollutants cause serious respiratory damage and other illnesses; when combined, they create what's known as acid rain, which causes long term damage to the environment and deterioration of natural and man-made structures.[41] Environmental Protection Agency has named American Electric a potentially responsible party at the Green River Disposal Inc. Superfund toxic waste site.[42]
Justice Department lawsuit[edit]
The United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit on November 3, 1999, against AEP and six other companies for violating the Clean Air Act. On October 8, 2007, AEP agreed to install US$4.6 billion in equipment to reduce emission, as well as pay a US$15 million civil fine and provide US$36 million for environmental projects and $24 million for environmental mitigation.[43][44] The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000 t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed.[45] According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states. The facilities are located in Moundsville (two facilities), St. Albans, Glasgow, and New Haven (two facilities), West Virginia; Louisa, Kentucky; Glen Lyn and Carbo, Virginia; Brilliant, Conesville, Cheshire, Lockbourne, and Beverly, Ohio; and Rockport and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
Political influence[edit]
AEP's political action committee, the American Electric Power Committee for Responsible Government, has increased spending since the 1998 election cycle, reaching $1.4 million in contributions in 2007–2008, 57 percent to Republicans.[46] Also in 2008, American Electric Power significantly increased lobbying expenditures from less than $2 million a year to over $11 million, as climate legislation became a key issue in Washington. As of December 2011, lobbying expenses remained between $6 million and $10 million per year.[47]
In 2009, AEP CEO Michael G. Morris contributed $100,000 to Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future, which supports increased oil drilling and opposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gas pollution.[48] American Electric Power is also a member of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying and marketing organization which opposes President Obama's climate and clean energy legislation.[49]
Paul Loeffelman, AEP director of environmental public policy, served as co-chair of the ALEC Energy, Environment, and Agriculture task force, which in 2012 adopted model legislation entitled the "Electricity Freedom Act", designed to repeal state-level mandates requiring electric utilities to produce some of their electricity from renewable sources.[50] In 2013, ALEC-affiliated legislators introduced bills in 13 states designed to weaken or repeal renewable energy mandates. None of the bills passed in 2013.[51]

American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.
AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000 km) network that includes 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined.[4] AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas.
AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345 kV transmission lines which took place in 1953.
AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.[5][6]

Subsidiaries[edit]
The company is divided into seven major geographic local operating companies:
AEP Ohio[edit]
AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers in central, southern and northwestern Ohio. For years, it consisted of two operating companies, Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power. However, in 2014, Columbus Southern was merged into Ohio Power, leaving Ohio Power as the legal operating company for regulatory purposes.
AEP Texas[edit]
AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997. It consists of AEP Texas North Company (formerly West Texas Utilities), which operates in west Texas, and AEP Texas Central Company (formerly Central Power and Light), which operates in south Texas.[7][8]
Appalachian Power[edit]
Appalachian Power (AP) is based in Charleston, West Virginia and owns the naming rights to Appalachian Power Park in Charleston. AP serves about one million customers in parts of central and Southern West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and parts of Northeast Tennessee, specifically Kingsport. Cities in the Appalachian Power service territory include Wheeling, Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia; Roanoke, Virginia and Kingsport.
Until the 21st century, AEP's operations in Tennessee were part of a separate operating company, Kingsport Power Company. However, since the turn of the millennium, Kingsport Power's operations have been almost completely merged with those of Appalachian Power, and AEP considers Appalachian Power to be the operating company in the Kingsport area. While Kingsport Power still legally exists, the Kingsport Power name is almost never used anymore except for regulatory formality.
Wheeling Power, based in Wheeling, West Virginia, was long treated as a de facto part of Ohio Power, but is now reckoned as part of Appalachian Power.
Indiana Michigan Power[edit]
Indiana Michigan Power serves northeastern and east central Indiana, including Muncie and Fort Wayne; and parts of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan, including South Bend, St. Joseph, Benton Harbor and Three Rivers.
Kentucky Power[edit]
Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. Kentucky Power is currently headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky but announced on July 13, 2016 that they were moving their state headquarters to Ashland, Kentucky by January 1, 2017.[9]
Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)[edit]
PSO was one of the four CSW operating companies when CSW merged with AEP.[10] Incorporated in 1913, PSO serves approximately 540,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma. Its headquarters are in Tulsa. PSO has 4,269 megawatts of generating capacity and provides electricity to 232 cities and towns across a service area encompassing 30,000 square miles.[11]
In April, 2014, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law an AEP-backed bill that would add a tax onto anyone in the state who adopted rooftop solar.[12] This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race.[13]
Southwestern Electric Power Company[edit]
Often called SWEPCO, the Southwestern Electric Power Company serves most of western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. Like PSO, it was one of the four CSW Operating Companies.[10]
Between 2013 and 2014, AEP, under subsidiary SWEPCO, tried to eliminate a fundamental solar policy, net metering, at the LPSC several times, and failed each time. SWEPCO also backed openly anti-solar candidate Eric Skrmetta, who has been widely criticized for receiving 2/3 of his campaign contributions from entities he regulates.[14]
In Arkansas, SWEPCO is expected in 2015 to ask regulators to allow them to pass along the costs of building and running the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, the most expensive project in state history, to Arkansas ratepayers. This process is expected to elicit similar controversy to what has plagued the plant since construction.[15]
Other subsidiaries[edit]
AEP also bought much of the town of Cheshire, Ohio, where the Gavin Power Plant is located, due to pollution issues.[16] In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP.[17]
The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas.
In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets.[18]
It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.
Nuclear[edit]
AEP owns and operates the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant. This accounts for 6% of the generation portfolio.
Hybrid technology[edit]
AEP is expanding its green efforts to include 18 more International DuraStar hybrid diesel trucks.[19] AEP is also teaming with Ford for the integration of a Vehicle-To-Power grid communication system, which allows hybrid vehicles to communicate with power companies to determine where, how long, and what it would cost to re-charge a hybrid during travel.[20]
Solar and wind energy[edit]
AEP recently[when?] signed a deal with Wyandot Solar LLC to purchase power from one of the largest solar fields in the eastern United States of America, based in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.[21]
AEP owns and operates the Desert Sky Wind Farm and the Trent Wind Farm.[22]
In 2009, AEP partnered with other energy companies in commissioning a study of how to transmit wind energy generated in the Upper Midwest to consumers in the East.[23]
AEP currently gets .02% of its energy from renewable energy resources like wind and solar.[24] They are planning to increase their reliance on coal in the next five years.[25] They occasionally support renewable energy in their utility territories, but only when they can own it through their regulated assets.
PATH Proposal[edit]
In 2007, AEP teamed with Allegheny Energy to propose the US$1.8 billion[26][27] (changed to US$2.1 billion in 2011[28]) Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH), a 290-mile (470 km), 765  kilovolt transmission line that would run through West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. According to Joe Denault, a volunteer spokesperson for the proposal, the PATH proposal would incorporate new technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 380,000 short tons (340,000 t) a year; allow for the transmission of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric; and generate 5,700 jobs, with $420 million in employee compensation annually.[29] However, many of these claims are disputed[30] and the proposal must pass several legal hurdles before moving forward.[31] On August 24, 2012, PJM Interconnection officially removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans, citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use.[32]
History[edit]
The American Gas and Electric Company, which would be renamed American Electric Power in 1958, was incorporated in 1906.[33] It replaced Electric Company of America, a holding company that had existed since 1899. It built "the first plant in the world to reheat steam to do double duty in the process of generating electricity"[33] at Philo, Ohio in 1923. Several of its holdings were divested following the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935; these holdings would include Atlantic City Electric (now a subsidiary of Exelon) and Scranton Electric (since absorbed by PPL).[34] However, it retained its Central System, which ran between Michigan and Virginia. It moved its headquarters from New York City to Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. On May 1, 1999, The North American electric power industry tested and cleared 75 percent of the U.S. electricity system for compliance with the Year 2000 computer glitch.[35] On August 31, 2004, American Electric Power Company's $10 billion acquisition of the Central and South West Corporation was approved.[36]
Acquisitions[edit]

1922 Indiana and Michigan Electric
1924 American Electric Power Company, a Philadelphia holding company
1925 Appalachian Power Company
1948 Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne
1980 Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company
1997 Central and South West Corporation (completed in 2000)[37]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 American Electric Power shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[38])
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks American Electric Power 45th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000 t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.[39] Major pollutants include sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and chromium, manganese and nickel compounds.[40] Overall, electric power plants, such as those operated by AEP, account for almost "70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions." Individually, these pollutants cause serious respiratory damage and other illnesses; when combined, they create what's known as acid rain, which causes long term damage to the environment and deterioration of natural and man-made structures.[41] Environmental Protection Agency has named American Electric a potentially responsible party at the Green River Disposal Inc. Superfund toxic waste site.[42]
Justice Department lawsuit[edit]
The United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit on November 3, 1999, against AEP and six other companies for violating the Clean Air Act. On October 8, 2007, AEP agreed to install US$4.6 billion in equipment to reduce emission, as well as pay a US$15 million civil fine and provide US$36 million for environmental projects and $24 million for environmental mitigation.[43][44] The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000 t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed.[45] According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states. The facilities are located in Moundsville (two facilities), St. Albans, Glasgow, and New Haven (two facilities), West Virginia; Louisa, Kentucky; Glen Lyn and Carbo, Virginia; Brilliant, Conesville, Cheshire, Lockbourne, and Beverly, Ohio; and Rockport and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
Political influence[edit]
AEP's political action committee, the American Electric Power Committee for Responsible Government, has increased spending since the 1998 election cycle, reaching $1.4 million in contributions in 2007–2008, 57 percent to Republicans.[46] Also in 2008, American Electric Power significantly increased lobbying expenditures from less than $2 million a year to over $11 million, as climate legislation became a key issue in Washington. As of December 2011, lobbying expenses remained between $6 million and $10 million per year.[47]
In 2009, AEP CEO Michael G. Morris contributed $100,000 to Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future, which supports increased oil drilling and opposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gas pollution.[48] American Electric Power is also a member of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying and marketing organization which opposes President Obama's climate and clean energy legislation.[49]
Paul Loeffelman, AEP director of environmental public policy, served as co-chair of the ALEC Energy, Environment, and Agriculture task force, which in 2012 adopted model legislation entitled the "Electricity Freedom Act", designed to repeal state-level mandates requiring electric utilities to produce some of their electricity from renewable sources.[50] In 2013, ALEC-affiliated legislators introduced bills in 13 states designed to weaken or repeal renewable energy mandates. None of the bills passed in 2013.[51]

American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.
AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000 km) network that includes 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined.[4] AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas.
AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.
American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345 kV transmission lines which took place in 1953.
AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.[5][6]

Subsidiaries[edit]
The company is divided into seven major geographic local operating companies:
AEP Ohio[edit]
AEP Ohio serves 1.5 million customers in central, southern and northwestern Ohio. For years, it consisted of two operating companies, Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power. However, in 2014, Columbus Southern was merged into Ohio Power, leaving Ohio Power as the legal operating company for regulatory purposes.
AEP Texas[edit]
AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997. It consists of AEP Texas North Company (formerly West Texas Utilities), which operates in west Texas, and AEP Texas Central Company (formerly Central Power and Light), which operates in south Texas.[7][8]
Appalachian Power[edit]
Appalachian Power (AP) is based in Charleston, West Virginia and owns the naming rights to Appalachian Power Park in Charleston. AP serves about one million customers in parts of central and Southern West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and parts of Northeast Tennessee, specifically Kingsport. Cities in the Appalachian Power service territory include Wheeling, Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia; Roanoke, Virginia and Kingsport.
Until the 21st century, AEP's operations in Tennessee were part of a separate operating company, Kingsport Power Company. However, since the turn of the millennium, Kingsport Power's operations have been almost completely merged with those of Appalachian Power, and AEP considers Appalachian Power to be the operating company in the Kingsport area. While Kingsport Power still legally exists, the Kingsport Power name is almost never used anymore except for regulatory formality.
Wheeling Power, based in Wheeling, West Virginia, was long treated as a de facto part of Ohio Power, but is now reckoned as part of Appalachian Power.
Indiana Michigan Power[edit]
Indiana Michigan Power serves northeastern and east central Indiana, including Muncie and Fort Wayne; and parts of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan, including South Bend, St. Joseph, Benton Harbor and Three Rivers.
Kentucky Power[edit]
Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. Kentucky Power is currently headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky but announced on July 13, 2016 that they were moving their state headquarters to Ashland, Kentucky by January 1, 2017.[9]
Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)[edit]
PSO was one of the four CSW operating companies when CSW merged with AEP.[10] Incorporated in 1913, PSO serves approximately 540,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma. Its headquarters are in Tulsa. PSO has 4,269 megawatts of generating capacity and provides electricity to 232 cities and towns across a service area encompassing 30,000 square miles.[11]
In April, 2014, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law an AEP-backed bill that would add a tax onto anyone in the state who adopted rooftop solar.[12] This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race.[13]
Southwestern Electric Power Company[edit]
Often called SWEPCO, the Southwestern Electric Power Company serves most of western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. Like PSO, it was one of the four CSW Operating Companies.[10]
Between 2013 and 2014, AEP, under subsidiary SWEPCO, tried to eliminate a fundamental solar policy, net metering, at the LPSC several times, and failed each time. SWEPCO also backed openly anti-solar candidate Eric Skrmetta, who has been widely criticized for receiving 2/3 of his campaign contributions from entities he regulates.[14]
In Arkansas, SWEPCO is expected in 2015 to ask regulators to allow them to pass along the costs of building and running the John W. Turk Jr. Coal Plant, the most expensive project in state history, to Arkansas ratepayers. This process is expected to elicit similar controversy to what has plagued the plant since construction.[15]
Other subsidiaries[edit]
AEP also bought much of the town of Cheshire, Ohio, where the Gavin Power Plant is located, due to pollution issues.[16] In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP.[17]
The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas.
In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets.[18]
It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.
Nuclear[edit]
AEP owns and operates the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant. This accounts for 6% of the generation portfolio.
Hybrid technology[edit]
AEP is expanding its green efforts to include 18 more International DuraStar hybrid diesel trucks.[19] AEP is also teaming with Ford for the integration of a Vehicle-To-Power grid communication system, which allows hybrid vehicles to communicate with power companies to determine where, how long, and what it would cost to re-charge a hybrid during travel.[20]
Solar and wind energy[edit]
AEP recently[when?] signed a deal with Wyandot Solar LLC to purchase power from one of the largest solar fields in the eastern United States of America, based in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.[21]
AEP owns and operates the Desert Sky Wind Farm and the Trent Wind Farm.[22]
In 2009, AEP partnered with other energy companies in commissioning a study of how to transmit wind energy generated in the Upper Midwest to consumers in the East.[23]
AEP currently gets .02% of its energy from renewable energy resources like wind and solar.[24] They are planning to increase their reliance on coal in the next five years.[25] They occasionally support renewable energy in their utility territories, but only when they can own it through their regulated assets.
PATH Proposal[edit]
In 2007, AEP teamed with Allegheny Energy to propose the US$1.8 billion[26][27] (changed to US$2.1 billion in 2011[28]) Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH), a 290-mile (470 km), 765  kilovolt transmission line that would run through West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. According to Joe Denault, a volunteer spokesperson for the proposal, the PATH proposal would incorporate new technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 380,000 short tons (340,000 t) a year; allow for the transmission of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric; and generate 5,700 jobs, with $420 million in employee compensation annually.[29] However, many of these claims are disputed[30] and the proposal must pass several legal hurdles before moving forward.[31] On August 24, 2012, PJM Interconnection officially removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans, citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use.[32]
History[edit]
The American Gas and Electric Company, which would be renamed American Electric Power in 1958, was incorporated in 1906.[33] It replaced Electric Company of America, a holding company that had existed since 1899. It built "the first plant in the world to reheat steam to do double duty in the process of generating electricity"[33] at Philo, Ohio in 1923. Several of its holdings were divested following the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935; these holdings would include Atlantic City Electric (now a subsidiary of Exelon) and Scranton Electric (since absorbed by PPL).[34] However, it retained its Central System, which ran between Michigan and Virginia. It moved its headquarters from New York City to Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. On May 1, 1999, The North American electric power industry tested and cleared 75 percent of the U.S. electricity system for compliance with the Year 2000 computer glitch.[35] On August 31, 2004, American Electric Power Company's $10 billion acquisition of the Central and South West Corporation was approved.[36]
Acquisitions[edit]

1922 Indiana and Michigan Electric
1924 American Electric Power Company, a Philadelphia holding company
1925 Appalachian Power Company
1948 Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne
1980 Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company
1997 Central and South West Corporation (completed in 2000)[37]

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 American Electric Power shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[38])
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks American Electric Power 45th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000 t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.[39] Major pollutants include sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, and chromium, manganese and nickel compounds.[40] Overall, electric power plants, such as those operated by AEP, account for almost "70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions." Individually, these pollutants cause serious respiratory damage and other illnesses; when combined, they create what's known as acid rain, which causes long term damage to the environment and deterioration of natural and man-made structures.[41] Environmental Protection Agency has named American Electric a potentially responsible party at the Green River Disposal Inc. Superfund toxic waste site.[42]
Justice Department lawsuit[edit]
The United States Justice Department filed a lawsuit on November 3, 1999, against AEP and six other companies for violating the Clean Air Act. On October 8, 2007, AEP agreed to install US$4.6 billion in equipment to reduce emission, as well as pay a US$15 million civil fine and provide US$36 million for environmental projects and $24 million for environmental mitigation.[43][44] The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000 t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed.[45] According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states.

Political influence[edit]
AEP's political action committee, the American Electric Power Committee for Responsible Government, has increased spending since the 1998 election cycle, reaching $1.4 million in contributions in 2007–2008, 57 percent to Republicans.[46] Also in 2008, American Electric Power significantly increased lobbying expenditures from less than $2 million a year to over $11 million, as climate legislation became a key issue in Washington. As of December 2011, lobbying expenses remained between $6 million and $10 million per year.[47]
In 2009, AEP CEO Michael G. Morris contributed $100,000 to Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future, which supports increased oil drilling and opposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gas pollution.[48] American Electric Power is also a member of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying and marketing organization which opposes President Obama's climate and clean energy legislation.[49]
Paul Loeffelman, AEP director of environmental public policy, served as co-chair of the ALEC Energy, Environment, and Agriculture task force, which in 2012 adopted model legislation entitled the "Electricity Freedom Act", designed to repeal state-level mandates requiring electric utilities to produce some of their electricity from renewable sources.[50] In 2013, ALEC-affiliated legislators introduced bills in 13 states designed to weaken or repeal renewable energy mandates. None of the bills passed in 2013.[51]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
