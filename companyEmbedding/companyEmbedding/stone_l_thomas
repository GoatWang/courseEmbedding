5.0 out of 5 starsSuperb introduction to canyon countryByDavid Morrison March 19, 2013This book deserves to be a cult classic for anyone getting to know the Canyonlands of the Colorado Plateau, and the Escalante region in particular. Fleishner has the mind of a scientist, the eyes of an artist, and the heart of a committed naturalist. The introductory explanation of why natural history as an essential human activity is persuasive, and the author backs it up with informative and entertaining stories from his extensive explorations in geology, ecology, cultural history, and natural resource policy.I use the entire book as a text for college students on a field course in the area, and hear nothing but praise from readers. If I could get an updated version to catch up with current events I'd snap up many copies!

3.0 out of 5 starsGloriously okay!ByMike Smithon September 30, 2005Without a doubt, the Escalante River is worth writing about.  It's a thin ribbon of shallow, silty water that winds a crooked course among some of the most beautiful slickrock and sandstone walls this side of Mars.  It's got reeds, arches, beaver dams, sunlight, and the remnants of forgotten people.  It's one of the most amazing places on earth, and it deserves volumes written in praise of it.That said, that's what this book's about.So, it's got to be at least okay, right?Don't worry.  It is.It's okay.It's got a good chapter on touring Glen Canyon Dam, a nice piece on the mystery of missing artist Everett Ruess, and some good descriptions of the rocks and plants and wildlife.It does drag on at points, though--as slow and muddy and meandering as the river the author's writing about....But maybe that's what he was going for.
