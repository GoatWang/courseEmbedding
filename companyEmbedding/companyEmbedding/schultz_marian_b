                                            Marion B. Schultz, age 95, passed away peacefully at HospiceCare Inc. in        Fitchburg, on    Saturday,     August 2, 2008.        Marion was born on        March 14, 1913 in        Galena,     IL. She graduated from Galena High School in 1931, the same year she married her high school sweetheart, Gayle Schultz, who was tragically kill in an accident a few months later. Before coming to        Madison in 1938,        Marion operated a small tearoom in        Galena. After she came to        Madison,        Marion assisted Dr. David L. Williams at his private practice, and later moved with him to the Jackson Clinic. She then retired from the Jackson Clinic in April 1978.        Marion returned to        Galena for her 50th high school reunion, where she re-met the boy that grew up next door to her, Meldon L. Wilmarth. After a brief courtship, they were married on    March 22, 1980, in which they had 25-plus wonderful years together. Marion and Meldon enjoyed traveling, being together, and just life in general. She is survived by her 2 step-sons, Dain (Jenette) Wilmarth of Portland, Oregon and Jim (special friend Bob) Wilmarth of Portland, Oregon; nephews Fred (Joyce) Williams of Madison, Dr. Reginald D. (Joan) Williams of San Antonio, Texas and many nieces and nephews. She is preceded in death by both of her husbands, Gayle Schultz and Meldon Wilmarth, her parents Fred and Emma Blum, Sister Leta B. Williams, and brother-in-law Dr. David L. Williams. A visitation will be held on Saturday, August 9th from    9:00AM until    11:00AM with a brief prayer service immediately following. A burial will be held at        Greenwood     Cemetery in        Galena,     IL at    2PM. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be given to the charity of your choice.            Cress Funeral & Cremation Service
