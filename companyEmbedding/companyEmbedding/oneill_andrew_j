First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

I am on a fixed income. I have been working on my credit, so I know that I need a car and I need to start my own business. I am a leader and serious about my finances.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Forced encapsulation cable splice enclosure including a container for exiting encapsulant



Patent number:  6218618
                                            

Abstract:  A method and apparatus is provided for encapsulating a cable splice. An enclosure shell is positioned about the cable splice. The shell includes an inlet port and an outlet port. A curable encapsulant is inserted into the shell through the inlet port. An outlet container is positioned over the outlet port to contain exiting encapsulant. The container is formed of light transmissive material so that the exiting encapsulant may be observed thereby providing a visual indication that the splice is fully encapsulated.

Bond bar for an electrical cable splice



Patent number:  5817979
                                            

Abstract:  A bond bar assembly spans an electrical cable splice. The bond bar assembly includes a conductive bond bar having opposed ends and a longitudinal central extent which spans the cable splice. Each end of the bond bar has a generally planar surface for engagement with the cable. A radially contractable clamping member is securable about the cable and about the planar surface of each bond bar end for securing the bond bar ends to the cable. The planar surface of each bond bar end includes a deflectable jacket skiving member which is deflectably movable from a first position in non-skiving engagement with the jacket of the cable to a second position in skiving engagement with the cable jacket upon the radial contraction of the clamping member. Such arrangement positionally confines and secures the bond bar with respect to the cable.

                                                    Grant

Method of sealing an elongate cable splice



Patent number:  5802715
                                            

Abstract:  A method and apparatus provides for the sealing of an elongate splice of an electrical cable. A central extent of the splice is enclosed in a cylindrical enclosure tube so as to define exposed lateral splice extents on each side thereof. Sealing dams are constructed about the cable adjacent each end of the cable splice and adjacent each end of the tube. The exposed lateral splice extents are covered with a pair of elongate generally cylindrical splice enclosing shells each having open ends. The open ends of the shells are sealably attached to the sealing dams to sealably enclose the cable splice. The shells and the tube are filled with a curable encapsulant to fully encapsulate the cable splice.

Forced encapsulation cable splice enclosure



Patent number:  5613298
                                            

Abstract:  The method and apparatus is provided for sealing a splice in an electrical cable. A pair of spaced-apart sealing dams are formed about the electrical cable with the splice being located therebetween. A generally cylindrical splice enclosing shell, having a pair of opposed open ends is supported around the splice. The shell includes plural shell fingers extending from each end of the shell. The shell fingers are secured to each other at a location outwardly adjacent of the sealing dams to positionally confine the sealing dams, preventing outward migration thereof. The splice may be encapsulated with an encapsulant under pressure, which is retained by the splice enclosing shell.

Light traceable transmission conduit assembly



Patent number:  5463706
                                            

Abstract:  A traceable transmission conduit assembly includes an optically transmissive jacket over a transmission conduit. The conduit, which may be an optical fiber, includes a light transmissive and translucent jacket thereover. Light is injected into the jacket at one location therealong. The light is emitted along the length of the jacket so that the jacket illuminates. One conduit bundled among a group of similar conduits may be traced by so illuminating the jacket of the one conduit.
