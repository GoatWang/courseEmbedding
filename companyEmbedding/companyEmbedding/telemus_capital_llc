Lloyd Perlmutter
 


Southfield-based Telemus Capital Partners LLC has hired Lloyd Perlmutter, the former CEO of Gap Canada Inc., to be COO as the wealth management firm embarks on an ambitious expansion to grow from $2.3 billion under management to $10 billion over the next five to 10 years.The strategy calls on both geographic expansion and reaching out to new types of customers. Partner and co-founder Lyle Wolberg said Telemus is in serious negotiations to buy wealth management firms in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Los Angeles and Florida. The other part of the growth strategy is to market to the growing tech community in Detroit and Ann Arbor — and bring on as clients company founders or executives who are younger than Telemus' typical client and have far less investable income than what the firm generally requires. Telemus has had a minimum threshold of investable assets for new customers of $1 million, with the average client having $5 million or more. Now, though, Telemus will take on clients with a small fraction of that $1 million minimum, provided they are the kind of successful entrepreneurs who Telemus execs think can evolve into a much more affluent customer. Sandy Kronenberg, who founded an IT company in 1997, is the poster child for what Telemus hopes to accomplish. In 2008, as an exception to its rule, Telemus took him on as a customer when he had far less than $1 million to invest. When Kronenberg sold his company in 2011, he suddenly — and easily — fit the traditional profile. To manage the accounts of younger customers, Telemus has hired younger investment advisers, bringing on five ages 30-35 in recent months. But while those younger, less-affluent customers build their investment base, it will be a geographic expansion that fuels Telemus' growth plans, Wolberg said. "What's the best way to get to $10 billion? By taking a company from being a regional powerhouse to having a national presence," he said. Telemus will target wealth management firms run by veterans of the industry who may be thinking of retiring or putting a succession plan in place, Wolberg said. Telemus' acquisitions will be funded in part by New York City-based Focus Financial Partners LLC, a wealth management firm with more than $60 billion under management. Last August, Focus Financial bought a minority stake in Telemus."They have more than a $500 million line of credit with eight or 10 national banks that we can draw on," Wolberg said. In February, Telemus began its current expansion by buying Los Angeles-based Concentric Capital LLC, which focuses on clients in sports and entertainment, for an undisclosed amount.In 2006, Telemus made its first acquisition, of Ann Arbor-based Beacon Investment Co.Wolberg and his co-founders, Chairman Gary Ran and Robert Stone, wanted to bring in a COO with a background in managing growing retail businesses. While at Gap Canada from 1996 to 2003, Perlmutter grew its business from $200 million a year to $1.2 billion.

After leaving the Gap, he ran retail operations for several Canadian companies, including Indigo Books and Music Inc., Clothing for Modern Times Ltd. and Mexx Canada Co. He has been in retailing his whole career, founding a company called Beaver Canoe after graduating from Harvard University and building it to 19 locations before selling it to Target Canada.Wolberg said Telemus' partners wanted to continue concentrating on investment strategies and wealth management and leave to someone else the day-to-day problems of managing a growing business with more and more offices."Lloyd is a perfect fit for us," Wolberg said. "We didn't want to hire someone inside the financial services industry. With his retail background, he can bring in a fresh set of eyes to look at the client experience." Said Perlmutter: "It's in my bloodstream. I wake up every day thinking about customers. My focus will be on improving the client experience, improving our in-house processes, bringing consistency to our operations as we grow and using technology, which is underutilized, as a driver." Telemus' growth strategy is sound, said Jim FitzGerald, president of Birmingham-based Munder Capital Management Inc. In April, Munder announced it was being acquired by Cleveland-based Victory Capital Holdings Inc. in a $400 million deal that was expected to close in the third quarter.Munder primarily serves institutional investors. Telemus serves high-net-worth individuals, which makes a COO focused on the client all the more important, FitzGerald said. "Institutional investors," he said, "don't need as much hand-holding."
