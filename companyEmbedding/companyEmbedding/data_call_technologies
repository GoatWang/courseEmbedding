					Data Call Technologies Launches the New DLMedia Product	









New Partnership with Direct Lynk Media
FRIENDSWOOD, TX--(Marketwired - Aug 7, 2013)
Data Call Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: DCLT) announces the launch of the Direct Lynk Media product, an answer to industry demands. Since the company's inception in early 2002, Data Call has been tuning and retuning the method of which their infotainment content processes and displays to thousands of Screens in the field. The company reports that the guidance of industry leaders has been mission critical. Data Call has made multiple enhancements and will still support the now legacy Direct Lynk Messenger (DLM) product. The company boasts that the new Direct Lynk Media (DLMedia) product stands far superior to the presiding DLM. One of the most anticipated items released in the new DLMedia product is the prudent use of images coinciding with the relevant content and a hybrid Traffic Map product. News content is offered as headlines, full story, or merely captions and images. Sports scores and information has been enhanced to offer more in game data as well as field weather. The company has also added with the DLMedia, new categories such as International News, Political News, Astrology, Lunar Phases and Multiple Financial products including Energy Rates and many more. The company also announces more format offerings such as MRSS to assist in the industry's next growth spurt.
Data Call takes the opportunity to also announce the launch of its newly revamped website (www.datacalltech.com) Besides a fresh new look and improved navigation, their website now features more detailed information on their extensive line-up of digital signage infotainment products. Clients and potential clients are able to understand more in detail what the company offers to fit their specific content needs. Many of the company's new visual products are being displayed, providing a more comprehensive view of the products offered by the company.
"This is a very refreshing moment for the team after years of diligent development and persistent distribution. The momentum this new offering brings is already creating new excitement and attraction to Data Call," stated Tim Vance, the company's Chief Executive and Operation Officer.
Data Call's trusted information feeds are consistently viewed throughout the digital signage space in numerous venues inclusive of airports, sports arenas, banks, clinics, car dealers, manufacturing plants, elevators, as well as electronic digital billboards.

Tim Vance, the company's CEO, stated, "I am extremely happy with the activity resulting from this year's expo. Our timing is on point with the addition of these latest products. The DS networks are now built and running. Networks and end users alike are in search of engaging content. Relevant, dynamic content. Check! We've got it. As we have been preaching -- Feed the Beast! Over the last couple of years, we have seen DS integration with smart phones. We are now witnessing the full circle between of both Digital Signage and Mobile products. It is not a battle of devices, yet a special harmony of the two. Our content keeps the DS screens fresh and vibrant while the network operators focus on their direct message to their audiences and integration with smart devices for rewards programs, recognition, and full viewer engagement. We empower the DS operators to leave the bulk of the content to us while they focus on other initiatives within their network's reach. The addition of this latest content has immediately opened doors to sectors that we have in the past struggled for presence in. It is a very exciting time for the company."

Data Call Technologies, Inc. - New Product Release




FRIENDSWOOD, TX--(Marketwired - Mar 22, 2016) -  Data Call Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: DCLT) (the "Company" or "Data Call") is a company specializing in the production, curation, aggregation and delivery of news and information content for the Digital Signage and Corporate Communication industries. The Company has been recognized by its peers as a pioneer with the wide range of its product offerings for the Digital Signage space since the early part of this decade. 
Last week the Company displayed its core content offerings of News, Sports and Weather at the 2016 Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. As promised earlier, Data Call followed through and released a sizeable amount of new products qualifying to part of their tag line "...and a whole lot more" at the Expo. All of the added products are playlist ready video and/or motion graphics, formatted for full screen viewing. 
In the General Interest category http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/general-interest/, the company added "Travel", "Animal Facts", "Picture Trivia", and an "HD Quote of the day".
In the Video category, the company introduced a Video in Demand editorial product "DCFlix ViD" http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/video/ 
The Company has also added a completely new category -- Health and Wellness. http://www.datacalltech.com/health-and-wellness/. This is an evidence based category including "Healthy Eating", "Wellness Top 10s", "Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables", "Healthy Workforce", and "Did you Know?" content.
Tim Vance, the company's CEO, stated, "I am extremely happy with the activity resulting from this year's expo. Our timing is on point with the addition of these latest products. The DS networks are now built and running. Networks and end users alike are in search of engaging content. Relevant, dynamic content. Check! We've got it. As we have been preaching -- Feed the Beast! Over the last couple of years, we have seen DS integration with smart phones. We are now witnessing the full circle between of both Digital Signage and Mobile products. It is not a battle of devices, yet a special harmony of the two. Our content keeps the DS screens fresh and vibrant while the network operators focus on their direct message to their audiences and integration with smart devices for rewards programs, recognition, and full viewer engagement. We empower the DS operators to leave the bulk of the content to us while they focus on other initiatives within their network's reach. The addition of this latest content has immediately opened doors to sectors that we have in the past struggled for presence in. It is a very exciting time for the company."
