I'd Like To See A Demo	








Who's using ZynBit 





This app does everything and more right out of the box. I have access to my custom fields within the app. Very cool!
Corey Shebesta - Love cool tools
Sales Manager




We have been using the ZynBit app for about a month now and are thoroughly pleased to this point! It has helped us properly file emails away within Salesforce for future reference by all our staff. Had a problem with an update, and had the support email answered in a timely manner by two support members. Give it a try!
Manny Varela - Great!
Business Relationship Manager




With this app, there's no excuse for not keeping your communication with customers up to date in salesforce. Everything you need is in ZynBit so no more jumping back & forth trying to remember to include everything. Couldn't be any simpler.
Mike Calhoun - Love this App! Outstanding Support!
Director of Sales






The ZynBit app has brought efficiency and optimization to the way I manage communication within Salesforce. All the way from creating a contact/lead to tagging e-mails or events, I can stay on top of my pipeline all within the comfort of Microsoft outlook. There’s no better app than ZynBit for the sales professional!!
Matt Clark - No better app than ZynBit
Account Executive




We implemented Salesforce four months ago and deployed ZynBit to our users at the same time. The integration is smooth and the implementation wasn’t too bad at all. We’re using Lightening and enjoy that we simply check a box in our ZynBit for Outlook toolbar and the event is added both to Outlook and Salesforce. Since we use Lightening, we do not get pop-up reminders for tasks. Using ZynBit, we can set a reminder to go off in Outlook right from the task creation screen in the ZynBit toolbar. Saves us some time.
We’re looking forward to checking out the cell phone app!
Chloe Majors - Saves us some time.
Salesforce Administrator




In 2015, Wenger abandoned Lotus Notes for Salesforce and Office365.  We now use Outlook and SharePoint to manage all customer correspondence.  Projects can span years, and customer relationships are king, thus volumes of email and documents are transmitted, stored and often reproduced.  With Salesforce and SharePoint in place, ZynBit provides the triangulation via Outlook for our Sales team to work with Salesforce and SharePoint by creating, updating and searching customer history, activities, email correspondence and documents. Total productivity gains are saving 30 minutes per day across 80 employees.  Savings are also being realized for non-Salesforce employees accessing SharePoint directly. ZynBit saves us $200,000 annually.
Scott Blahosky - ZynBit saves us $200,000 annually.
IT Director

App-X Announces New Functionality with AIM Inbox | Business Wire


























































App-X Announces New Functionality with AIM Inbox




App-X’s AIM Inbox powered by ZynBit seamlessly integrates its AIM 
      Private Equity CRM with Microsoft Outlook






June 02, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BROOMFIELD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--App-X, the leading provider of flexible, web-based software solutions 
      for alternative asset fund managers, institutional investors, and impact 
      investors, today unveiled AIM Inbox powered by ZynBit, a new feature 
      designed to integrate the AIM solution on the Salesforce platform into 
      Microsoft Outlook. Leveraging its deep Private Equity industry 
      experience, App-X partnered with ZynBit to develop an inbox solution 
      that fits the needs of Private Equity clients. This partnership 
      integrates ZynBit’s Outlook software with AIM making it possible for 
      users to view, edit, and create data without ever leaving Outlook.
    


      “Many of our Private Equity clients utilize Microsoft Outlook, and 
      despite the options that exist, we felt it was key to integrate AIM more 
      seamlessly with their favorite mail platform,” shares App-X’s Vice 
      President of Products, Jeff Williams. “AIM Inbox offers users the 
      opportunity to create and edit data directly through the integration 
      interface, so you don’t need to exit Outlook to update a contact’s 
      record, nor to create a new deal.”
    

      A primary objective for AIM Inbox is to eliminate ‘swivel chair’ 
      inefficiencies, or managing data through two or more systems resulting 
      in poor time management and increased risk of errors. This new 
      functionality will improve data integrity, enabling more effective 
      decision-making and eliminating disconnected workflows for greater 
      operational efficiency. Likewise, this product-based integration allows 
      for industry-specific upgrades and improvements as the needs of clients 
      evolve. Another key value-add for AIM Inbox lies in its integration with 
      the overall AIM customer experience, from start to finish, thereby 
      providing a simplified vendor experience and ensuring adoption through 
      App-X’s Customer Success program.
    

      “AIM provides our clients the optimal CRM solution for Private Equity 
      and now with AIM Inbox, fund managers and institutional investors can 
      easily manage AIM right from their inbox,” adds Mr. Williams. “This 
      Outlook integration capability eliminates the inefficiencies of vetting 
      and on-boarding a third party service provider, and allows our clients 
      to streamline their time on Outlook and our platform to maximize 
      productivity. This is another way in which we’re designing our solutions 
      for the way Private Equity thinks.”

      web-based software solutions for Alternative Asset Fund Managers,

About eFusion
About eFusion, Our Culture, and What Drives Us









Content Management Archiving, LLC (CMA) is now wholly owned by ZynBit.com, Inc. This is an exciting time for the company, our partners, and customers. Partnering with Salesforce, the world’s leading CRM, our collective product suite now integrates CRM and ECM solutions simultaneously, so our customers are able to manage their customer interactions and all associated documents with one simple solution. As such, Email Manager is now a ZynBit product, which we look forward to continually improving with you.
The name change from CMA to ZynBit will only affect you in that you will now be receiving invoices from Zynbit.com, Inc. instead of CMA. Otherwise, all pre-existing licensing, maintenance, and partner contracts have not changed. We plan to continue to enhance and support the Email Manager product with the same quality and rigor we always have.
For questions or follow up, please contact Bonnie Rappe, Channel Manager at bonnie.rappe@zynbit.com or 360-601-4145.
Thank you to our customers and partners.  We look forward to continuing this journey together!
