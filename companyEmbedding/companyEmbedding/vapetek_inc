 Vapetek, Inc. (VPTK)

The Company’s business product mix currently stands at 25% e-liquids and 75% devices, which consist of e-cig, rechargeable batteries and vapor devices.
Thus far all of their revenues have been from the sale of 3 products; The Vapetek Liquivape e-Liquid, 1100 mAh Vapetek Batteries and our DA Blaster product.
All of their products are U.S. pharmacopeia (USP) grade which means their e-liquids meet the product quality and standards set by The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, a non-profit organization that publishes food ingredients and dietary supplements.
Food ingredients, flavorings and colorings, are reviewed by the USP and these standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help ensure that these products are of appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity and consistency.
The Company has positioned itself as a technology company focused on the adoption of electronic vaporizing cigarettes (commonly known as “e-cigarettes”) by the world’s 1.2 Billion smokers.
The Company provides high quality e-cigarette devices, electronic refillable and rechargeable atomizers and e-liquids offering a much safer alternative delivery system for nicotine.
There are an estimated 300,000,000 people in the United States, with approximately 28% or 84,000,000 of the population classified as active cigarette smokers.

NOTE
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

The
Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. These unaudited condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2015
included on the Company’s Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2016.
The results of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year ending December 31, 2016.

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical
information, information that is currently available to the Company
and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Investment
in Marketable Securities

The
Company’s securities investments that are bought and held
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are
classified as trading securities. Trading securities are recorded
at fair value on the balance sheet in current assets, with the
change in fair value during the period included in other income and
expense.

 

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue is
only recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(3) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured.

 

On
occasion the Company may receive payment for a sale in advance of
shipping the product. When this occurs the funds received are
considered to not yet be earned and are reported as a liability on
the financial statements as deferred revenue.

 

Returns,
Repairs and Exchange Policy

It is the
policy of the Company to issue no refunds once an order has been
shipped unless due to product defects or Company error. The default
warranty for all products is 14 days unless otherwise specified.
Eligibility for refunds, repairs or exchanges are limited to
products determined to have manufacturing defects or premature
failure. Products that are damaged through misuse, negligence, and
abuse or modified or repaired by anyone other than Vapetek, Inc.

The
Company records shipping costs in accordance with EITF 00-10
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. Accordingly,
the shipping costs is shown in the financial statements to be
included with general and administrative expense.

Due to personal tastes and preferences the Company does not offer

purchases are final.

fulfillment errors occur, requests to correct mistakes that are
made by the Company resulting in a customer’s receipt of
incorrect or missing items in the order will be accepted for 14
days after the receipt of the order. Requests for missing or
incorrect items will not be accepted after 14 days from the date
the order has been received.

 

Stock-based
compensation

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees
under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, “Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees” (“Topic No. 505-50”).
Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions
with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of
common stock issued for payments to non-employees in accordance
with ASC Topic 505, “Equity”, whereas the value of the
stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined
at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is
reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to
earn the equity instrument is complete. The fair value of equity
instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, the Company
recognizes an asset or expense in the same manner as if it was to
pay cash for the goods or services instead of paying with or using
the equity instrument.

 

The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in
accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation
- Stock Compensation which requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values
on the grant date.  The fair value of the equity
instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited
to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services
are rendered. There has been no stock-based compensation issued to
employees.

 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are
in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the
Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

NOTE 6.  GOING
CONCERN

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and has
an accumulated a deficit of $629,219 as of September 30,
2016.  The Company requires capital for its contemplated
operational and marketing activities.  The
Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the
future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of
additional financing, the successful development of the
Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its
transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability
to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments
that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned
uncertainties.

LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2014 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- VAPETEK™, Inc. has announced a new line of e-liquid, a vegetable-glycol solution for use in portable vaporizers, which contains CBD, or cannabodiol. As one of the active ingredients in cannabis, cannabidiol offers consumers a THC-free product made for use in personal vaporizer devices, and other vaporizer technology.
Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140711/126344 
Cannabis naturally contains 483 different compounds which are currently known, two of which are tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is the ingredient which is most often responsible for the impairment associated with marijuana, but CBD is currently still being researched for any medical benefits that it may provide. With Vapetek, Inc.'s CBD eLiquid, it may now be possible for consumers to experience the compound for themselves in a completely legal manner.
Touted by public figures such as Sanjay Gupta, originally a strong opponent of legalized cannabis, CBD has been said to promote better health. Evaluations by the FDA are still required before any official medical benefit statements can be made, but current research is positive. As a possible alternative to medical marijuana, which still carries heavy legal implications in many states, CBD eLiquid may be valuable to consumers that seek a THC-free product that has been said to promote calm and reduce anxiety, among other possible benefits.
The initial flavor, "Blueberry Kush," is mixed, steeped, and delivered with the same laboratory and shipping standards as Vapetek, Inc. other eLiquid products for electronic vaping devices. High testing standards also ensure that ingredient ratios are consistent for each batch of the CBD eLiquid line.
This product can currently be purchased from VAPETEK™, Inc. authorized distributor West Coast Vape Supply, which receives orders through their website, www.westcoastvapesupply.com
VAPETEK™, Inc. will also be attending the Champs Tradeshow in 2014, July 15th through July 17th  at booth number 1540 in Las Vegas, NV. where they will be displaying the newest CBD product line. To learn more about Champs counterculture tradeshow, visit there website: www.champstradeshows.com
