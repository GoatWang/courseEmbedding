ATLANTA - May 9, 2017 -  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) today unveiled its new Atrius(TM) brand, encompassing the company's portfolio of Internet of Things (IoT) business solutions and Atrius software platform. Through Atrius, Acuity Brands will continue to provide and expand its comprehensive set of IoT business solutions, leveraging intelligent luminaires, lighting and building management controls, software platform services and solution development tools.  
Atrius solutions deliver connectivity and intelligence to a space via an expansive network of smart LED lighting and controls and a software platform that gathers, unlocks and transforms raw data to enable a broad range of software solutions addressing critical business challenges. Atrius solutions have been already deployed across more than 50 million square feet of indoor spaces, leveraging more than a million sensors. Additionally, an installed base of Acuity Brands networked lighting systems, encompassing more than one billion square feet, can now be upgraded to a more multifunctional Atrius sensory network that can supply IoT data to the Atrius platform. 
The Atrius software platform is a robust, scalable and secure platform that enables an array of capabilities, including indoor positioning, asset tracking, space utilization, spatial analytics and energy management. The Atrius Solution Builder provides a comprehensive development environment for customers and partners to build IoT solutions leveraging the Atrius platform. And the Atrius partner program enables lighting manufacturers to add their luminaires to the Atrius sensory network, and software companies to leverage the power of smart lighting to deliver impactful business solutions to their customers. 
Atrius offers building owners and business managers endless possibilities to enhance the utilization of their space through empowering better human interaction and greater asset and employee productivity. For example, Atrius business solutions can help employees to find an available meeting room, empower travelers to navigate busy airports, guide shoppers to a specific product on a store shelf or permit a retailer to receive an alert that a customer needs sales assistance. 
 "Lights are installed throughout most of our indoor and outdoor spaces. In addition, lights are powered and connected, and with the emergence of LED lighting, they now feature onboard intelligence," said Greg Carter, Vice President and General Manager of Atrius. "That's why we believe LED lighting is the best and least expensive infrastructure for delivering a sensory network that feeds IoT platforms to connect systems, spaces and people. With our full-suite of IoT solutions, now consolidated under the Atrius brand, Acuity Brands has moved well beyond the 'proof of concept' stage to deploying full-scale IoT capabilities and solutions." 
Atrius IoT applications utilize LED lighting infrastructure rather than requiring additional equipment like stand-alone beacons or dedicated IoT networks, bringing a faster return-on-investment. As IoT technology improves, upgrades are simple and cost effective. Further, the conversion of conventional lighting to LED lighting can provide the energy savings to help fund evolving IoT capabilities. 
Acuity Brands will be demonstrating Atrius (Booth #1713) during LIGHTFAIR® International,      May 9-11, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, PA.  For more information about Atrius, please visit www.acuitybrands.com/atrius. Also, register for an Atrius webinar scheduled for Thursday, May 18th at 11:00 AM EDT (8:00 AM PDT).  For more webinar and registration details visit: Brilliant Experiences.

Acuity Brands shares jump 11% after earnings beat
Shares of Acuity Brands Inc.  surged 11% in early trade Thursday, after the maker of lighting products reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter. The company said it had net income of $82.2 million, or $1.90 a share, in the quarter, up from $74.0 million, or $1.69 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $2.15, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $2.02. Sales rose to $891.6 million from $851.5 million, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $879 million. "Our third quarter net sales reflect continued solid performance even though initial industry data suggests that the growth rate of the Company's key end markets in North America grew only in the low single-digit range," Chief Executive Vernon Nagel said in a statement. "We believe the market growth rate reflected continued softness in demand for certain short-cycled, smaller lighting projects." Shares have fallen 14% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 9%.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-138129722, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Maybe the exterior walls have become dingy or weathered, or maybe it's just time for a new paint scheme to go with your updated decor. Whatever your reasons, using quality paints, supplies and tools helps you get the job done right and fast, and it also helps you create a look that you'll love. Check out the paints, wall coverings and paint products we have at Walmart. We have low prices, every day, on everything, making it easy to get all the painting supplies you need.Interior and exterior paints and primersNo matter what you need to paint, we have the paint for it. Use interior wall and trim paint in the correct formulation for any room in your home   whether you're painting your baby's nursery or adding dynamic color to your living room. There are exterior wall and trim paints that can give that 10-year-old paint job on the outside of your home a refreshed look. If you're painting inside and looking to hide some imperfections above, use ceiling paints that can do the job. Maybe you have a dull finish on your refrigerator or dishwasher, but they still work like new. Refresh the exterior of these items with appliance paint. If you have oil stains and oil paint spills you want to cover up on your garage floor, concrete stain or paint or concrete coating can make everything look uniform.Paints come in several types and are used at certain points during the painting process or used to create certain finishes:Primer   Primer is the first coat of paint that goes on either new or uncoated surfaces and is suitable for protecting the surface of what you're painting. Primer is available as either oil-based or water-based. When applying primer, you can use any paint tool to apply it, such as a paintbrush, roller or pad. Don't use a paint sprayer, however; it can clog.Flat   A type of latex paint, flat paints are commonly used for ceilings and interior walls. Exterior flat paints sometimes have vinyl mixed in to make them more durable. To apply flat paint, you can use a paintbrush or roller. This type of paint is completely matte without any shine.Eggshell   For paint that has a slight shine to it, use eggshell paint, especially on wood surfaces. Except for a paint sprayer, you can apply eggshell paint any way you want.Gloss and satin   Gloss and satin are virtually the same paints, except that satin has less shine to it. Ideal for both interiors and exteriors, gloss and satin paints are best applied with a paintbrush.StainsStains are used both inside and outside the home. Inside, people use them most often on furniture that's either brand new, sometimes referred to as nude furniture, or furniture they're restoring. Outside, desks and patios are the most frequent places people use stains. You might want to use interior wood stain to make furniture match what's already in your home. Wood stain is also terrific at bringing out the wood's natural grain. For both inside and out, stains are available in three forms: water-based, oil-based and gel stain, which is an oil-based wood stain that has a no-drip formula and is ideal for painting walls or other vertical surfaces. Water-based stains have less odor and dry faster, and they're popular for interior wood staining.Wallpaper and wall bordersFor those who want a change from painted walls, wallpaper and wall borders are another way to go. The styles of wallpaper are almost as varied as the colors of wall paint. Many wallpaper schemes draw from the style of furniture that's in a home, meaning you have traditional, modern, contemporary or Scandinavian wallpaper styles to choose from. For children's rooms, cartoon characters and animal prints are terrific options. For the edges around a room's ceiling you can use wallpaper borders, which are peel-and-stick pieces, to set off your wallpaper. If you want, you can combine painted walls with wall decals, which don t take up entire walls. Although some wallpaper is the peel-and-stick kind, for others you'll need to invest in some wallpaper epoxy or glue and smoothing tools, scoring tools and stripping liquid for removing any existing wallpaper.Other paint productsIn addition to paintbrushes, rollers, pads and sprayers, there are other tools you may need to include for your painting job. These include painter's masking tape for covering areas that you don t want to risk getting paint on, sandpaper for smoothing any wood surfaces before painting or staining them, tarps or drop cloths for protecting the floor and furniture, paint trays for accessing paint and protective gear like masks and goggles if you're using a paint sprayer.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384881, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
