	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	 




	This
	report contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of
	risks and uncertainties. Although our forward-looking statements
	reflect the good faith judgment of our management, these statements
	can be based only on facts and factors of which we are currently
	aware. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently
	subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may
	differ materially from results and outcomes discussed in the
	forward-looking statements.




	 




	Forward-looking
	statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words
	such as “may,” “will,”
	“should,” “anticipate,”
	“believe,” “expect,” “plan,”
	“future,” “intend,” “could,”
	“estimate,” “predict,” “hope,”
	“potential,” “continue,” or the negative of
	these terms or other similar expressions. Such forward-looking
	statements are based on our management’s current plans and
	expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in
	plans that may cause actual results to differ materially from those
	anticipated in the forward-looking statements. You should be aware
	that, as a result of any of these factors materializing, the
	trading price of our common stock may decline. These factors
	include, but are not limited to, the following:




	 








	 






	●






	the
	availability and adequacy of capital to support and grow our
	business;








	 






	●






	economic,
	competitive, business and other conditions in our local and
	regional markets;








	 






	●






	actions
	taken or not taken by others, including competitors, as well as
	legislative, regulatory,


	judicial and other
	governmental authorities;








	 






	●






	competition
	in our industry;








	 






	●






	changes
	in our business and growth strategy, capital improvements or
	development plans;








	 






	●






	the
	availability of additional capital to support development;
	and








	 






	●






	other
	factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report.








	 




	The
	cautionary statements made in this quarterly report are intended to
	be applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever
	they may appear in this report.




	 




	We urge
	you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
	statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We
	undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward
	looking-statements, whether as a result of new information, future
	events or otherwise.

	NOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS




	 




	Note 1. The Company History and Nature of the Business




	 




	Hotapp
	International Inc., formerly Fragmented Industry Exchange Inc.,
	(the “Company” or “Group”) was incorporated
	in the State of Delaware on March 7, 2012 and established a fiscal
	year end of December 31. The Company’s initial business plan
	was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve
	buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented
	industries. The Company determined it was in the best interest of
	the shareholders to expand its business plan. On October 15, 2014,
	through a sale and purchase agreement (the “Purchase
	Agreement”) the Company acquired all the issued and
	outstanding stock of HotApps International Pte Ltd (the
	“HIP”) from Singapore eDevelopment Limited
	(“SeD”). HIP owned certain intellectual property
	relating to instant messaging for portable devices (the
	“HotApp”). HotApp is a cross-platform mobile
	application that incorporates instant messaging and ecommerce. It
	provides a messaging and calling services for HotApp users (text,
	photo, audio). HotApp can be used on any mobile platform (i.e. IOS
	Online or Android).




	 




	Pursuant
	to a Purchase Agreement, the Company issued SeD 1,000,000 shares of
	common stock and 13,800,000 shares of newly created convertible
	preferred stock. See Note 8 for further description.

	* On

	issued share capital in HotApp International Limited.




	 




	The
	financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a
	going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its
	assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of
	business. Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses of
	$4,762,794 and has net working capital deficit of $757,495 at March
	31, 2017. Management has concluded that due to the conditions
	described above, there is substantial doubt about the entities
	ability to continue as a going concern through May 12, 2018. We
	have evaluated the significance of the conditions in relation to
	our ability to meet our obligations and believe that our current
	cash balance along with our current operations will not provide
	sufficient capital to continue operation through 2017. Our ability
	to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving sales
	growth, management of operating expenses and ability of the Company
	to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
	come due, and upon profitable operations.




	 




	Our
	majority shareholder has advised us not to depend solely on it, for
	financing. We have increased our efforts to raise additional
	capital through equity or debt financings from other
	sources.    However, we cannot be certain that such
	capital (from our shareholders or third parties) will be available
	to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are
	acceptable to us.   Any such financing likely would
	be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in
	significant financial operating covenants that would negatively
	impact our business.  If we are unable to raise
	sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
	insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned
	growth.




	 




	These
	financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
	recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or
	amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
	this uncertainty.




	 




	Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 




	Basis of presentation




	 




	The
	condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 was
	derived from audited financial statement but does not include all
	disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in
	the United States of America. The other information in these
	condensed financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of
	management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair
	presentation of the results for the periods covered. All such
	adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed
	otherwise. These condensed financial statements, including notes,
	have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the
	Securities and




	Exchange
	Commission and do not include all of the information and
	disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in
	the United States of America for complete financial statements.
	These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
	with the financial statements and additional information as
	contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
	December 31, 2016.




	 






	 




	8










	 






	 




	Basis of consolidation




	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements of the Group include the
	financial statements of Hotapp International Inc and its
	subsidiaries.  All inter-company transactions and
	balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.




	 




	Use of estimates




	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues, cost
	and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
	Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s
	consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, the
	useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, valuation
	allowance for deferred tax assets and share-based
	compensation.




	 




	Cash and cash equivalents




	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid
	investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, or
	which have original maturities of three months or less when
	purchased.




	 




	Foreign currency risk




	 




	Because
	of its foreign operations, the Company holds cash in non-US
	dollars.   As of March 31, 2017, cash and cash
	equivalents of the Group includes, on an as converted basis to US
	dollars $25,365, $52,037 and $18,951 in Hong Kong Dollars
	(“HK$”), Reminbi (“RMB”) and Singapore
	Dollars (“S$”), respectively.




	 




	The
	Renminbi (“RMB”) is not a freely convertible
	currency.   The State Administration for Foreign
	Exchange, under the authority of the People’s Bank of China,
	controls the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. The value
	of the RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and
	to international economic and political developments affecting
	supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System
	market.




	 




	Concentration of credit risk




	 




	Financial
	instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentration of
	credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
	equivalents.  The Group places their cash with financial
	institutions with high-credit ratings and quality.




	 




	Fixed assets, net




	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
	Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
	following estimated useful lives:




	 








	Office
	equipment






	3
	years








	Computer
	equipment






	3
	years








	Furniture
	and fixtures






	3
	years








	Motor
	vehicles






	10
	years








	 




	Fair value




	 




	Fair
	value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or
	paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
	market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
	fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
	permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the
	principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
	and it considers assumptions that market participants would use
	when pricing the asset or liability.




	 




	Revenue recognition




	 




	The
	Group recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
	exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
	determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The Group
	currently has $66,178 revenue from its services rendered on
	projects, and plans to derive its revenue from membership
	subscription services, offering the platform for Enterprise
	Collaboration with integration. Revenue is currently recognized
	under contract accounting due to the significant software
	production required, and the percentage-of-completion method is
	used in accordance with ASC 605-35. The Company is recognizing the
	percentage-of-completion based on input measures that measured
	directly from expenses incurred, and management reviews the
	progress to completion.




	 






	 




	9










	 






	Research and development expenses




	 




	Research
	and development expenses primarily consist of (i) salaries and
	benefits for research and development personnel, and
	(ii) office rental, general expenses and depreciation expenses
	associated with the research and development
	activities.  The Company’s research and development
	activities primarily consist of the research and development of new
	features for its mobile platform and its self-developed mobile
	games. Expenditures incurred during the research phase are expensed
	as incurred.




	 




	Income taxes




	 




	Current
	income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the
	relevant tax authorities.  Deferred income taxes are
	recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases
	of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
	consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry
	forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates
	applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
	valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is
	more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax
	assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and
	non-current based on their characteristics.




	 




	The
	impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return
	is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to
	be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain
	income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a
	50% likelihood of being sustained.  Interest and
	penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the
	provisions for income taxes. The Group did not recognize any income
	tax due to uncertain tax position or incur any interest and
	penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses for
	the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015,
	respectively.




	 




	Uncertainties
	exist with respect to the application of the New EIT Law to our
	operations, specifically with respect to our tax
	residency.  The New EIT Law specifies that legal entities
	organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for PRC
	income tax purposes if their “de facto management
	bodies” as “establishments that carry on substantial
	and overall management and control over the operations, personnel,
	accounting, properties, etc. of the
	Company.”  Because of the uncertainties that have
	resulted from limited PRC guidance on the issue, it is uncertain
	whether our legal entities outside the PRC constitute residents
	under the New EIT Law.  If one or more of our legal
	entities organized outside the PRC were characterized as PRC
	residents, the impact would adversely affect our results of
	operations.




	 




	Foreign currency translation




	 




	The
	functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United
	States dollar (“U.S. dollar”). The financial records of
	the Company’s subsidiaries located in Singapore, Hong Kong
	and the PRC are maintained in their local currencies, the Singapore
	Dollar (S$), Hong Kong Dollar (HK$) and Renminbi ("RMB"),
	which are also the functional currencies of these
	entities.




	 




	Monetary
	assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
	functional currency are translated into the functional currency at
	the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
	Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
	during the year are converted into functional currency at the
	applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions
	occurred.   Transaction gains and losses are
	recognized in the statement of operations.




	 




	The
	Company’s entities with functional currency of Renminbi, Hong
	Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar, translate their operating results
	and financial positions into the U.S. dollar, the Company’s
	reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the
	exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues,
	expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate
	for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative
	translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of
	comprehensive income (loss).




	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded other
	comprehensive loss from translation loss of $84,004 in the
	consolidated financial statements.




	 




	Operating leases




	 




	Leases
	where the rewards and risks of ownership of assets primarily remain
	with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases. Payments
	made under operating leases are charged to the consolidated
	statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease
	periods.




	 




	Comprehensive income (loss)




	 




	Comprehensive
	income (loss) includes gains (losses) from foreign currency
	translation adjustments. Comprehensive income (loss) is reported in
	the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
	loss.




	 






	 




	10










	 






	Loss per share




	 




	Basic
	loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to
	shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
	during the period.




	 




	The
	Company's convertible preferred shares are not participating
	securities and have no voting rights until converted to common
	stock.   As of March 31, 2017, no shares of
	preferred stock are eligible for conversion into voting common
	stock.




	 




	Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted




	 




	In May
	2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
	Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing
	accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the
	FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the
	effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to
	allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original
	effective date. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to
	have a significant effect on our consolidated financial
	statements.




	 




	In
	November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
	2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of
	Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of
	deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and
	liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The
	updated standard is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2017.
	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a
	significant effect on our consolidated financial
	statements.




	 




	On Feb.
	25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released
	Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic
	842) (the Update). The new leasing standard presents dramatic
	changes to the balance sheets of lessees. Lessor
	accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the
	lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. The Company
	does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 to have a material
	impact on its financial statements.

	Note 5.  SHARE CAPITALIZATION




	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue 500 million shares of common stock
	and 15 million shares of preferred stock.  Both share
	types have a $0.0001 par value.  As of March 31, 2017 and
	2016, the Company had issued and outstanding, 5,909,687 of common
	stock, respectively and 13,800,000 shares of preferred stock,
	respectively.




	 




	Common Shares:




	 




	On July
	13, 2015, SED acquired 777,687 shares of the Company common stock
	by converting outstanding loans made to the Company into common
	stock of the Company at a rate of $5.00 per share (rounded to the
	nearest full share). After such transactions SED owned 98.17% of
	the Company.




	 




	Preferred Shares:




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Purchase Agreement, dated October 15, 2014, the Company
	issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to
	SED.   Such amount represented 19% ownership in the
	Company.  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated October
	15, 2014, the Company issued 13,800,000 shares of a class of
	preferred stock called Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Preferred
	Stock”) to SED. The Preferred Stock has no dividend or voting
	rights. The Preferred Stock is convertible to common stock of the
	Company dependent upon the number of commercial users of the
	Software. For each 1,000,000 commercial users of the Software
	(without duplication), SED shall have the right to convert
	1,464,000 shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock into 7,320,000 shares
	of Common Stock, so that there must be a minimum of 9,426,230
	commercial users in order for all of the shares of the Perpetual
	Preferred Stock to be converted into common stock of the Company
	(13,800,000 shares of Preferred Stock convertible into 69,000,000
	shares of common stock).




	 
	 




	Other
	than the conversion rights described above, the Preferred Stock has
	no voting, dividend, redemption or other rights.




	 




	Note 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES




	 




	On May
	9, 2016, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 1,231

	payments of $2,241. The Company was required to put up a security
	deposit of $4,482. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the
	Company recorded rent expense of $6,734 for the Guangzhou
	office.




	 




	On
	April 10, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 347

	monthly payments of $2,574. The Company was required to put up a
	security deposit of $5,147. On March 16, 2017, the Company entered
	into a lease agreement for 1,504 square feet of office space in
	Kowloon, Hong Kong. This lease commenced on March 16, 2017 and runs
	through March 31, 2019 with monthly payments of $3,281. The Company
	was required to put up a security deposit of $6,563. For the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded rent expense of
	$8,088 for these offices.

	Note 7.  RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND
	TRANSACTIONS




	  




	During
	the period covered by this report, Mr. Chan Heng Fai was the
	Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and a member of the
	Board. Mr. Chan is also the Chief Executive Officer of Singapore
	eDevelopment Limited (“SeD”), a Singapore
	company.   SeD is the majority shareholder of the
	Company.  The Company’s other two directors
	included Lum Kan Fai, who served as the Company’s Chief
	Technology Officer during the period covered by this report and who
	has entered into an employment arrangement with the Company’s
	wholly owned subsidiary, HotApp International
	Limited.    As of the date of this report, the
	Company has not entered into any employment arrangement with any
	director or officer.




	 






	Note 8.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT




	 




	On
	March 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Loan Conversion
	Agreement with SeD, pursuant to which SeD agreed to convert
	$450,890 of debt owed by Company to SeD into 500,988,889 common
	shares at a conversion price of $0.0009.




	 




	The
	Company’s board of directors and majority stockholder have
	approved an increase in the number of the Company’s
	authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000
	by means of an amendment to the Company’s Articles of
	Incorporation. This amendment was filed with the State of Delaware
	on May 5, 2017. This increase in authorized shares will permit the
	Company to issue the 500,988,889 shares of common stock described
	above.




	 




	On
	March 27, 2017, SeD and the Company also entered into a Preferred
	Stock Cancellation Agreement, by which SeD agreed to cancel its
	13,800,000 shares Perpetual Preferred Stock issued by the
	Company.




	 




	The
	terms of the additional shares of common stock will be identical to
	those of the currently outstanding shares of Common Stock. However,
	because the holders of common stock do not have preemptive rights
	to purchase or subscribe for any new issuances of common stock, the
	authorization and subsequent issuance of additional shares of
	common stock will reduce the current stockholders’ percentage
	ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of common stock.
	This amendment and the creation of additional shares of authorized
	common stock will not alter current stockholders’ relative
	rights and limitations.

	Background




	 




	Hotapp
	International Inc, formerly Fragmented Industry Exchange Inc., (the
	“Company” or “Group”) was incorporated in
	the State of Delaware on March 7, 2012 and established a fiscal
	year end of December 31. The Company’s initial business plan
	was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve
	buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented
	industries. The Company determined it was in the best interest of
	the shareholders to expand its business plan. On October 15, 2014,
	through a sale and purchase agreement (the “Purchase
	Agreement”) the Company acquired all the issued and
	outstanding stock of HotApps International Pte Ltd (the
	“HIP”) from Singapore eDevelopment Limited
	(“SeD”). HIP owned certain intellectual property
	relating to instant messaging for portable devices (the
	“HotApp”). HotApp is a cross-platform mobile
	application that incorporates instant messaging and ecommerce. It
	provides a messaging and calling services for HotApp users (text,
	photo, audio). HotApp can be used on any mobile platform (i.e. IOS
	Online or Android).

	* On

	issued share capital in HotApp International Limited.




	 




	The
	Group has relied significantly on SeD as its principal sources of
	funding during the year. The Board has, in the meantime, reviewed
	and approved the restructuring of HotApp, by which has since
	reduced by half its personnel resources as compared to 2015. HotApp
	has revamped its business model and technology platform to focus on
	business-to-business (“B2B”) services, built around
	enterprise communications and workflow. Its product line will
	target these industries: (i) network and direct marketing; (ii)
	enterprise Voice-over-IP; (iii) enterprise messaging; (iv) real
	estate; (v) social media; (vi) e-commerce; (vii) investor
	relations; (viii) healthcare and wellness; and (ix) hospitality,
	combining HotApp applications with hotel-room management. This
	strategic shift is intended to create commercial value with a
	sharper focus.

	Our Business




	 




	HotApp,
	our software application, is a community communications ecosystem
	(the “Platform”), connecting users who wish to seek out
	both local and global communities (“Users” or
	“Communities”) and equipping them with necessary tools
	to communicate effectively across borders. HotApp will monetize the
	relationship between brands, Online-2-Offline (“O2O”)
	operators and service providers (collectively,
	“Enterprises”) and the HotApp Communities, and in the
	process mediate something of value to both parties.




	 




	With
	our Platform, users can discover and build their own communities
	and create valuable content. Our Platform tools empower these
	communities to share their thoughts and words across multiple
	channels. As these communities grow, they provide the critical mass
	that attracts enterprises. Enterprises in turn enhance user
	experience with premium contents, all of which are facilitated by
	the transactions of every stakeholder via e-commerce.




	 




	Trends in the Market and Our Opportunity




	 




	According
	to eMarketer Research in Nov 2016, by 2019, more than one-quarter
	of the world’s population will be using mobile messaging
	apps.




	 




	Mobile
	phone messaging apps will be used by more than 1.4 billion people
	in 2016, an increase of almost 16% from 2015.




	 




	The
	Asia-Pacific region is home to more than 50% of all chat app users
	worldwide, with more than 805 million consumers in
	2016.




	 




	In
	addition to the substantial opportunities in consumer messaging
	market, Enterprise Messaging and Collaboration Services and Apps
	are widely deployed in Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Large
	Enterprise as an alternative to Email and Intranet. This emerging
	need in Enterprise Messaging and Collaboration offers a huge
	opportunity for IT service providers in offering development,
	integration and white label services for SMEs and Corporations.
	According to Statista, global messaging platform service providers
	are expected to bring in US$1.8 billion revenue riding on the
	growth in growing demand of Enterprise Messaging.




	 




	Based
	upon the above trends, we believe significant opportunities
	exist for:




	 






	●




	Enterprise
	deploying messaging platform to effective engage different
	stakeholders.








	●




	Continuing growth
	in demand for OTT Services encapsulated within a single mobile app
	with a clear intent and objectives fulfilling the communication
	need for specific communities and industries.








	●




	Enterprises to
	increase usage of OTT Services, such as adoption of Enterprise
	messaging Apps alongside with using of email, video and audio
	conferencing, collaboration through cloud services, as a new medium
	for different stakeholder engagement including customers, to
	promote and market their products and services (Collaboration
	Framework). HotApp’s approach in white labelling for the
	enterprises will augment and fill this demand in the market. White
	label refers to packaging HotApp solution under brand name of
	clients with some content being customized only for
	clients.








	●






	Industries such as
	Network Marketing and Hospitality and Franchising businesses are
	utilizing OTT Services to reach out effectively to their marketing
	network on a global basis.






	 




	Our Plan of Operations and Growth Strategy




	 




	We
	believe that we have significant opportunities to further enhance
	the value we deliver to our Users.    We intend
	to pursue the following growth strategy:




	 






	●




	Position HotApp as
	an open platform to be ready for integration with third party
	technology partnerships such as Payment Services, Loyalty Programs,

	Results of Operations




	 




	Summary of Key Results




	 




	For the unaudited three months period ending March 31, 2017 and
	2016




	 




	Revenue




	 




	Revenue
	consist primarily of the service rendered on projects which require
	significant software production. Total revenue for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $66,178 and $0
	respectively. 




	 




	Cost of revenue




	 




	Cost of
	revenue consist primarily of salary and outside consulting expenses
	incurred directly to the projects. Total cost of revenue for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $14,105 and $0,
	respectively.




	 




	Research and Development Expense




	 




	Research
	and development expenses consists primarily of salary and
	benefits.   Expenditures incurred during the
	research phase are expensed as incurred.   We expect
	our research and development expenses to maintain with moderate
	changes in line with business activities.  Total research
	and development for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016
	were $52,662 and $138,447, respectively.  The
	decrease was due to the reduction of development staff which is in
	line with the streamlining and restructuring of
	Company.




	 




	Sales and Marketing Expense




	 




	Sales
	and marketing expenses consist primarily of third party
	professional service providers. We expect our sales and marketing
	expenses to maintain with moderate changes in line with business
	activities. Total sales and marketing expenses for the quarters
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0 and ($64,576), respectively.
	The negative ($64,576) was due to a reversal of $65,252 provision
	for HotApp Credit Points because the program was
	eliminated.




	 




	General and Administrative




	 




	General
	and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and
	benefits, professional fees and rental expense.  We
	expect our general and administrative expenses to maintain with
	moderate changes in line with business activities.  Total
	general and administrative expenses for the quarters ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016 were $196,138 and $259,914,
	respectively. 




	 




	Other Expense (Income)




	 




	In the
	quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred $65,572
	and $754 in foreign exchange gain and $2,663 and $0 for the
	deposits written off.




	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	At
	March 31, 2017, we had cash of $98,145 and working capital deficit
	of $757,495.  Cash had decreased during the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 primarily due to operating losses incurred during
	the quarter.




	 




	We had
	a total stockholders’ deficit of $716,137 and an accumulated
	deficit of $4,762,794 as of March 31, 2017 compared with a total
	stockholders’ deficit of $498,315 and an accumulated deficit
	of $4,628,976 as of December 31, 2016.   This
	difference is primarily due to the net loss incurred during the
	quarter.




	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a net loss of
	$133,818. We made a positive adjustment of $8,636 due to
	depreciation, a positive adjustment of $2,663 due to deposits
	written off and a negative adjustment of $65,572 due to foreign
	currency transaction gain. We had a negative change of $66,033 due
	to costs in excess of billings and account receivable, a negative
	change of $6,796 due to security deposit and other receivables, and
	a negative change of $13,449 due to prepaid expenses. We had a
	negative change of $18,239 due to accounts payable and accrued
	expenses. As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities
	of $292,608 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.




	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss of
	$340,068. We made a positive adjustment of $14,209 due to
	depreciation and a negative adjustment of $754 due to foreign
	currency transaction gain. We had a negative change of $77,525 due
	to accounts payable and accrued expenses. We had a negative change
	of $6,431 due to prepaid expenses and a positive change of $7,037
	due to accrued taxes payable and franchise fees. As a result, we
	had net cash used in operating activities of $403,532 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2016.






	 




	15










	 






	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, we spent $3,898 on the
	acquisition of fixed assets, resulting in net cash used in
	investing activities of $3,898 for the period.




	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2016, we spent $2,515 on the
	acquisition of fixed assets, resulting in net cash used in
	investing activities of $2,515 for the period.




	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, we had net cash provided by
	financial activities of $310,307 due to advances from
	affiliate.




	 




	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2016, we did not pursue any financing
	activities.




	 




	As of
	March 31, 2017, we have fixed operating office lease agreements for
	Guangzhou’s office amounting to $11,205 from 2017 to 2018,
	Hong Kong’s offices minimum lease commitments of $41,007 from
	2017 to 2018.




	 




	We will
	need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings.
	However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from SED or third
	party) will be available to us or whether such capital will be
	available on a term that is acceptable to us. Any such financing
	likely would be dilutive to existing shareholders and could result
	in significant financial and operating covenants that would
	negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise
	sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
	insufficient funds to operate our business and pursue our business
	plan.




	 




	Consistent
	with Section 144 of Delaware General Corporation Law, it is our
	current policy that all transactions between us and our officers,
	directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such
	transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested
	directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders, or are fair to
	us as corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or
	ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate review of all
	related party transactions on an ongoing basis.




	 




	Critical Accounting Policies




	 




	Our
	discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of
	operations are based upon the Company’s financial statements,
	which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
	estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
	liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
	contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates,
	assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies
	described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial
	statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
	policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters,
	actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying
	the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical
	accounting policies affect working capital account balances,
	including the policies for revenue recognition, allowance for
	doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and income taxes. These
	policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our
	financial statements as of a given date.




	 




	Within
	the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
	currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
	that would result in materially different amounts being
	reported.




	 




	Revenue recognition




	 




	The
	Group recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
	exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
	determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The Group
	currently has $66,178 revenue from its services rendered on
	projects, and plans to derive its revenue from membership
	subscription services, offering the platform for Enterprise
	Collaboration with integration. Revenue is currently recognized
	under contract accounting due to the significant software
	production required, and the percentage-of-completion method is
	used in accordance with ASC 605-35. The Company is recognizing the
	percentage-of-completion based on input measures that measured
	directly from expenses incurred, and management reviews the
	progress to completion.




	 




	Research and development expenses




	 




	Research
	and development expenses primarily consist of (i) salaries and
	benefits for research and development personnel, and
	(ii) office rental, general expenses and depreciation expenses
	associated with the research and development
	activities.  The Company’s research and development
	activities primarily consist of the research and development of new
	features for its mobile platform and its self-developed mobile
	games. Expenditures incurred during the research phase are expensed
	as incurred.




	 




	Income taxes




	 




	Current
	income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the
	relevant tax authorities.  Deferred income taxes are
	recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases
	of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
	consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry
	forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates
	applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
	valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is
	more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax
	assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and
	non-current based on their characteristics.




	 






	 




	16










	 






	 




	Uncertainties
	exist with respect to the application of the New EIT Law to our
	operations, specifically with respect to our tax
	residency.  The New EIT Law specifies that legal entities
	organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for PRC
	income tax purposes if their “de facto management
	bodies” as “establishments that carry on substantial
	and overall management and control over the operations, personnel,
	accounting, properties, etc. of the
	Company.”  Because of the uncertainties resulted
	from limited PRC guidance on the issue, it is uncertain whether our
	legal entities outside the PRC constitute residents under the New
	EIT Law.  If one or more of our legal entities organized
	outside the PRC were characterized as PRC residents, the impact
	would adversely affect our results of operations.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this 
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of these shares.

The Company Shares are being offered on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum 
number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering
price per share is $0.12. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds 
assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the Company Shares
offered for sale. The first $25,000 of proceeds raised will go to pay 
outstanding legal expenses related to this offering which are estimated at 
$25,000.

The above figures represent only estimated costs.

The Company will pay all costs related to this offering. Absent available
working capital and revenues to pay these amounts, we will seek financial
assistance either from our major shareholder, director, officer, or possibly
third party business associates of our director or officer who may agree to loan
us the funds necessary to cover the balance of outstanding professional and
related fees related to our prospectus to the extent that such liabilities
cannot be extended or satisfied in other ways and the professional service
providers insist upon payment. Absent the above, our officers and directors will
attempt to seek sufficient funding personally for the amounts due and, if
successful in obtaining these funds, to lend it to the Company on an
interest-free basis. No formal written arrangement exists, with respect to our
founder, president, and chief executive officer or anyone’s commitment outside
of the Company, to loan funds for this purpose.  Our current legal counsel has
agreed to defer payment of a portion of its fees until commencement of the
offering.

Our plans will not change regardless of whether any proceeds are raised.


Online Matching Services, Technology or M&A Portals:

There are currently a large number of privately owned websites providing
business merger & acquisition services.   Such sites include,
www.rainmaker24.com, www.businessforsaleexchange.com,
www.buysellaustin.com. However, we know of no such publicly traded
companies. Parallels can be drawn between online dating sites and our emerging
online deal sourcing technologies.  The online dating industry is dominated by
several large corporations and well-known websites. Such companies include,
Match (and affiliated sites), PlentofFish, Spark Networks, eHarmony, Mate1.

To be successful, we believe new entrants must have a differentiated offering.
We believe, new companies are challenged to recruit new users when they do not
already have a substantial pool of existing users, as a result, marketing costs
for new firms are disproportionately high. There is no assurance that we can
produce sufficient revenue to cover our expenses, including such marketing
costs, and, as such, an investor may lose all their investment.

However, management believes that competitive advantages for our business plan
will include:

. Industry specific matching and business services;

. ease of searching and matching of buyers and sellers through our 
  to-be-completed Algorithm;

. the expected interactive nature of our site provided by discussion forums; 

. the proposed proactive sending of information to users who register with   
  our website to encourage repeat visits to our site

. our plans for providing supporting executive level consulting and back-office 
  services.

We continue to review and collect information on existing web sites that provide
business merger and acquisition.  We have compiled a list of features that these
web sites offer and intend to present the market with a comprehensive and user
friendly website that provides more information, more current data, a larger set
of features and a more user friendly interface than the majority of the existing
sites Such features, may include, but not be limited to, benchmarking surveys,
job search links.

Management expects to invest in ongoing development of the Algorithm,
maintenance and expansion of the first Industry Exchange in order to remain
competitive but believes the primary revenues will be driven by the success of
our Business Service.   The scope of the ongoing development of the Algorithm
will be determined by the revenue generated and potentially by future financing
opportunities.

The Professional Business Services Consulting Industry

Competition in the professional consulting services markets in which we operate
is highly fragmented, consisting of several large global firms including;
McKinsey & Co, The Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte Consulting LLP,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and several thousand smaller firms.  We may compete
with both the large firms and the smaller firms in all areas of our service
offerings.

The markets for the Company’s services and products are highly competitive.
There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants occur frequently, resulting in
considerable market fragmentation. Companies in this industry compete on a
number of parameters including degree and quality of Consultants, position
knowledge, industry expertise, service quality, and efficiency in completing
assignments. Typically, companies with greater strength in these parameters
garner higher margins.


Company Description
Fragmented Industry Exchange Inc. (formerly known as Ontarget Staffing Inc.) was
incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit Company on March 7, 2012
and established a fiscal year end of December 31. We are a development-stage
financial acquisition intermediary which will serve buyers and


 sellers for
companies that are in highly fragmented industries (i.e. industries in which
there is no clear leader in market share). We plan to do this by developing a
secure online, merger and acquisition (M&A) platform that matches buyers and
sellers in specific industries (“Industry Exchanges”) and provide consulting and
back office support services. The Industry Exchanges will use a proprietary 
search algorithm, if completed, to automatically assess business buyers’ and 
sellers’ profiles, then match only relevant counterparties (the “Algorithm”). 
We are currently in discussion with an outside third party developer who will be
used to complete our Algorithm. Once finalized, the contract will include an
arrangement with an independent contractor to perform all work needed to
complete the project. As of the date of this prospectus, the development
contract has not been signed. Development of the algorithm will commence once
sufficient funds are available to provide a $5,000 down payment for the
development contract. Currently, we anticipate requiring $25,000 to fund
development of the algorithm. We expect to have an initial Algorithm completed
by the 4th quarter of 2014. Until we complete our Algorithm, we will use
Microsoft excel to track buyers and sellers and related profiles. The matching
process will be done manually based upon the review of excel information.  
Certain factors used to match counterparties include: geographic location of the
business, size of business, revenues, cash flow of business, asking price and
availability of seller financing. Buyers and sellers’ responses for these (and
other factors) will be input into excel spreadsheet and a manual comparison will
conducted to determine whether any potential matches between buyers and sellers
exist based on the criteria established. Upon determination of any matches,
sellers are informed of potential buyers. Upon seller confirmation of interest
in a potential buyer, we provide the contact information for such buyer. We are
not involved in any transaction between the counterparties. We believe that by
providing our industry-specific Business Services we can drive more revenue and
expand our relationship with the Industry Exchange members. Whether a member
consummates an M&A transaction with a counterparty member from the Industry
Exchange or not, members might use our Business Services as part of their
existing business. Initially, our Business Services will include assistance
with; (i) revenue generation, more specifically, online marketing, and (ii)
expense efficiencies, more specifically, accounting and financial support,
insurance planning and human resource advisory.  Furthermore, our Business
Services will be marketed through a separate web portal from our Industry
Exchanges.  We believe that approach may allow us to attract other clients that
are not actual members of the Industry Exchange. Until we generate enough
revenue or raise additional capital, our CEO will deliver our Business
Services. As of the date of this prospectus we have no Business Services
clients. We intend to market these Business Services to companies in each of the
industry specific sections. For example, we have already compiled a list of
10,220 US based staffing companies (“Target Customers’) with information that
includes: company’s name, estimated sales, # of employees, phone fax, contact at
firm, title and address. We intend to market through a combination of methods
including internet campaigns, search-engine optimization and direct marketing
campaigns.

The first Industry Exchange we have developed is for the staffing industry and
have launched our two first industry-specific portal sites -
www.staffingbizbuysell.com and www.staffingbizvalue.com (the “Websites”) for the
staffing industry. We currently have 3 seller members listed on this first
exchange which is branded on the website as the “Staffing Exchange.”  The
“Staffing Exchange” is not a separate corporate entity—rather it identifies the
name of the specific Industry Exchange. Our first business portal site is
branded on the web site as “OnTarget360”, which is not a separate corporate
entity. We are not currently providing Business Services for any of these
clients. As we do not have any current “Buyer” members, we have only provided
listing services for these members. Other fragmented industries for which we may
develop similar exchanges and websites include: insurance, golf, hair and nail
salons and plastics. We will create branded websites for each Industry Exchange
created.

Each Industry Exchange will also offer an Industry Forum where users can discuss
their industry experiences and business best practices.  Over time, we believe
we can accumulate a significant knowledge base of industry information and
develop and distribute proprietary content (“Industry Research”).  Should
revenues increase and/or financing be available, we may develop our own industry
research group.   No timeline or specific business plan has been developed to
deliver Industry Research, however, we expect to be performing such work by the
1st calendar quarter of 2015.  The Industry Research may be offered on a free
basis for general information or as a subscription service for more detailed
information and access to research specialists.

We also intend to offer discussion forums where users of our website can
exchange feedback, tips, social networking advice and ideas. Users will be
required to register and provide their business name, activity, mailing and
email address in order to be able to participate in our discussion forums.  We
may also offer incentives, to encourage users to provide us with more detailed
business information like revenue, number of employees, and advertising
spending.   We may offer users the option to opt into promotional e-mails which
we would then be able to send on a targeted basis on behalf of advertisers in
order to increase our revenue opportunities.

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in March 2012 as Ontarget
Staffing, Inc., which name was changed to Fragmented Industry Exchange, Inc. in
August 2013. Our principal office address is 80 Mountain Laurel Road, Fairfield,
CT 06824 and our telephone is 203-344-7044.
