About VSP Global - The History of Vision Service Plan (VSP)

Skip to main content






  VSP'S History In 1955, a small group of optometrists had a vision to provide affordable, accessible, high-quality eye care to the world. They formed the first prepaid, not-for-profit vision benefit company, California Vision Services, the precursor to Vision Service Plan (VSP). Today, with its five complementary businesses, VSP Global remains committed to those same principles.     Choose Decade  1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s       1950s - 60s With a dream to offer affordable, accessible, high-quality eye care insurance, a group of optometrists in Oakland, CA, form the first prepaid, not-for-profit vision benefit organization 		                                           – CVS (California Vision Services), the precursor to VSP.      1955 With a dream to offer affordable, accessible, high-quality eye care insurance, a group of optometrists in Oakland, CA, form the first prepaid, not-for-profit vision benefit organization – CVS (California Vision Services), the precursor to VSP.    1965 The idea of pre-paid vision care catches on and CVS signs a significant client, the Western Conference of Teamsters.    1968 With a growing client base and rapid business expansion, CVS moves its headquarters from Oakland to Sacramento, CA, under the leadership of John O'Donnell, the first president and CEO.      1970s - 80s VSP reaches 100 employees and is available in four states – California, Oregon, Nevada and Hawaii. VSP signs its first major health plan client, marking VSP's entrance into                                           the managed care market.      1972 CVS opens its first optical lab in Sacramento, CA, to better serve its members and network providers with a wide range of products and specialized services.    1976 CVS officially becomes Vision Service Plan (VSP) when it registers the VSP service mark.    1979 VSP signs its first major health plan client, marking VSP's entry into the managed care market.    1980s VSP makes an official decision to become a national company with plans to expand to all 50 states. Throughout the decade, the company continues to experience growth with revenue of $100 million, 2.4 million members, and a provider network of more than 5,000.      1990s Vision care benefits grow increasingly popular among employers as they recognize the competitive advantage of providing their employees with a complete benefits package. As a result, membership increases 11 times to more than 31 million. By the end of the 90s, VSP earns $1 billion in revenue.         1992 VSP launches Altair® Eyewear, a private-label frame company that sells its products                                     exclusively to VSP network providers.     1993 Roger Valine becomes president and CEO of VSP and the company moves its headquarters to Rancho Cordova, CA, where its campus is still located today.    1994 VSP's employee population reaches 1,000.    1995 VSP covers 25 million Americans, earns $1 billion in revenue, and logs nearly 1,000,000 calls a month at its call centers.    1997 The Sight for Students® program launches, delivering free eye care services to thousands of children in need.      2000s During the first decade of the millennium, VSP celebrates its 50th anniversary, launches Eyefinity, a business solutions company for practices, and buys the frame company Marchon. Additionally, VSP Optics Group opens three new optical labs and introduces the first UNITY product. With these endeavors, VSP vastly expands its footprint in the optical industry.      2000 VSP launches Eyefinity®, a separate company that provides business solutions to VSP network                               providers.    2003 VSP opens its second high-tech optical lab, located outside Columbus, OH.    2004 VSP is recognized by J.D. Power and Associates, which ranked the company “Highest in Member Satisfaction Among National Vision Plans” three years in a row, 2004-2006.       2005 When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast, VSP was on the scene to replace lost or damaged eyewear and help doctors continue to provide care. The response, which provided eye care for 11,175 people, would grow into the VSP Mobile Eyes® program. In September, VSP celebrates its 50th anniversary. VSP also ranks 10th in Fortune Magazine's "Best 100 Companies to Work for."     2006 VSP begins providing voluntary coverage to many of the more than 8 million federal employees and retirees. Rob Lynch takes the helm of VSP as president and CEO.    2007 VSP launches the first VSP Mobile Eyes clinic with two state-of-the-art eye exam rooms and a full eyewear dispensary. When not responding to disaster, the clinic will travel the U.S. to provide no-cost eye care and eyewear for people in need. VSP begins to expand its company and network of providers internationally. VSP also begins offering a "direct to consumer" comprehensive eye care plan to those who don’t have access to vision coverage through an employer. In addition, VSP purchases its third optical lab, Legends 4.0™, located in Lewisville, TX.       2008 VSP expands its existing frame and practice solutions business by acquiring Marchon, an industry-leading manufacturer, designer, and distributor of quality eyewear and sunwear.                                     OfficeMate, Marchon’s practice solutions business, merges with Eyefinity to create Eyefinity/OfficeMate, and Altair becomes an eyewear division of Marchon. VSP purchases its fourth optical lab, Ultra Lens, in Fort Lauderdale, FL.     2009 The VSP Global brand launches, further extending its reach across the world to help people see.      2010s After an amazing start to the first decade of the 21st century, VSP continues to innovate and look to the future of the optical industry. In 2015, the company celebrated its 60th "Diamond" anniversary, and now serves more than 80 million members, 57,000 clients and 37,000 network providers worldwide.      2010 VSP launches the VSP Eye on Diabetes campaign which provides free comprehensive                               eye exams and health risk assessments for diabetes and high blood pressure to low-income, uninsured, and underinsured Americans. Vision Monday names VSP Labs the "Top Lab of 2010."    2011 VSP responds to the destruction caused by 358 tornadoes in 21 states with a state-of-the-art 45-foot mobile eye                               exam clinic to help tornado victims regain their sight after losing or breaking their glasses. VSP also provided the American Red Cross with 3,000 gift certificates valued at $1.15                               million to distribute to Red Cross clients affected by the destruction. The VSP Eye on Wellness program launches, helping doctors achieve their annual continuing education requirements at no cost to them, while empowering them with the latest research and data on important subject matters impacting the profession. VSP Optics Group launches UNITY® Performance Optics.    2012 VSP Global provides relief efforts for victims of Superstorm Sandy with deployment of two VSP mobile eye care clinics and gives the American Red Cross 2,100 gift certificates, valued at more than $800,000, to distribute to those in need. Marchon acquires Dragon Alliance, one of the world’s leading goggle and performance eyewear brands in the action sports market, and Scandinavian Eyewear, which has a 65-year history of designing optical frames for the Nordic region. Inc. Magazine names VSP Global a top job creator in 2012, ranking it 11th in its inaugural "Hire Power Awards" which recognizes businesses that are adding jobs and rebuilding                               the economy. Further, the organization was ranked 4th in California as a top job creator. In December, key VSP Global stakeholders met to discuss the need for an innovation arm within the organization to embrace disruption and test new products and business models. The Shop was formed, with co-leads Jay Sales and Leslie Muller leading the bi-coastal innovation labs in Sacramento, CA, and New York City, NY, respectively.    2013 VSP Vision Care launches in the Australia, UK and Ireland markets. VSP Global announces the launch of Eyes of Hope®, a global corporate social responsibility initiative. To date, through Eyes of Hope programs that include Sight for Students and VSP Mobile Eyes, VSP Global has invested $175 million to provide no-cost eye care and eyewear for 1 million people in need. VSP Global introduces the Premier Program, a national community of private practices that offer the best patient experience, where VSP members can maximize their benefits and Premier Program practices receive valuable opportunities.       2014 VSP Global announces the creation of a new division to give consumers more choice in eye care, eyewear, and shopping experiences. VSP announces a partnership to provide prescription lenses for members who use Google Glass and introduces a training program for optometrists to become certified as VSP Glass Preferred Providers. Marchon and The Shop also team up with licensor Diane von Furstenberg and Google to launch the DVF | Made for Glass collection.    2015 VSP celebrates 60 years of vision, innovation and giving, and welcomed its fourth president and CEO, Jim McGrann. Looking forward, VSP Global has its sights on reimagining how eye care and eyewear are delivered globally. Through its innovation lab, The Shop, VSP Global debuts "Project Genesis," the first wearable tech prototype from a healthcare company to seamlessly integrate health-tracking technology into an optical frame. Nearly 18 million WellVision Exams® were delivered by VSP doctors to ensure that members received the personalized care they deserve, and more than $21 million in extra frame value was delivered.   2016 VSP Global celebrates a huge milestone — helping 1 million people see through Eyes of Hope programs — and announces the A Million More initiative to provide no-cost eye care and eyewear to an additional 1 million individuals in need by 2020. The Shop collaborates with Nike Vision and Zeiss to create a new, innovative line of running eyewear that combines Nike's expertise in athletic performance and VSP Global's expertise in eyewear design. More than 82 million members and counting have every VSP Global employee’s commitment to the company's mission to help people see their world clearly. The company continues its commitment to provide people around the world with a lifetime of good vision!   2017 VSP Global and the U.S. Conference of Mayors renew their partnership to increase access to vision care for thousands of adults and children in need. VSP Global partners with more than 40,000 VSP network doctors worldwide to serve 84 million members globally.

Roger J. Valine

A Sociology major, Roger J. Valine graduated from Sacramento State in 1973. He chose that major because it reflected the interest in human relationships that he learned to value growing up in a supportive family.
The Valine family has operated farms in the Sacramento area for generations; his family immigrated here from the Azores in 1860. Mr. Valine was born and raised in Sacramento.
 The Sociology degree also helped prepare Mr. Valine for a career that involved understanding organizations and responding to people's needs. After graduation, he joined a company, then known as California Vision Service, as a management trainee. In 1992, he became president and chief executive officer of that company, now called Vision Service Plan (VSP). That year, VSP earned $1.122 billion in revenue. It has become the nation's leading eye care health plan, providing eye and vision care services to 14,000 employer and health plans covering 24 million members.
VSP is a non-profit organization that gives back much to the community. Its "Sight for Children" program, for example, contributes $7 million to provide eye exams and glasses for the working poor. The year that Mr. Valine assumed the reins of VSP, the company established the Roger Valine-VSP Scholarship at Sac State to recognize his years with the company and to contribute to what Mr. Valine values greatly: education.
Ever an active supporter of CSUS, Mr. Valine received the University's Distinguished Service Award from the Alumni Association in 1997. Ever active in the Sacramento community, he serves on the board of directors for a number of organizations. Included among those organizations is the Sacramento Region Economic Cluster Project, on which Mr. Valine is a leading participant in the Capital Region Business Education Partnership.

"I thoroughly enjoyed my education. At the time that I was going to school I was also working full time, and Sac State was there when I needed it, offering the right courses at the right times, and giving me a safe place to study where people cared about my welfare. It gave me a good education and a ticket to play."
