Advisory Board Opportunity With Doll & Media Brand
Gengirl Media, Inc.


Gengirl Media, Inc. DBA - iBesties: Middle School Moguls is currently seeking executive advisors with experience in Business Development and Industry Experience. Please submit your information through our candidate portal below for consideration.
iBesties: Middle School Moguls is a doll and media brand that aims to inspire the new generation of kidpreneurs. The Middle School Moguls brand tells the story of a group of girls at Mogul Academy— an unconventional school run by eccentric billionaire businesswoman.
Each with their own unique talents, the girls find themselves in a high-tech, faced-paced, world of adventure as they work to build businesses, friendships and unforgettable fun!
The Middle School Moguls are as diverse as the girls who love them. Distinct in culture, personality and talents, they come from backgrounds that include blended families, bi-racial families, military families and single-parent households.
The brand promotes entrepreneurship, diversity, technology learning, and leadership for young girls while meeting dual customer needs— girls’ desire to own the products, and parents’ eagerness to buy them.
Helmed by Gina Heitkamp, an entrepreneur with 7 years of experience bringing new start-ups to market, and Jenae Heitkamp, a children’s therapist immersed in the wants, needs and desires of the target market, iBesties has a core team of award-winning industry professionals who are ready to see brands that inspire girls to create their own happily ever after.
