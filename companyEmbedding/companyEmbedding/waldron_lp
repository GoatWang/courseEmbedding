FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Dusko Goykovich with Nathan Davis & Mal Waldron —
            Swinging Macedonia ... LP 

Enja/Be! (Germany),             1966. New Copy (reissue)...
        
$24.99

Add to Cart
A legendary German session from the 60s – and a record that really showcases the unusual criss-crossing of modes that was going on in the European scene at the time!  There's a very strong MPS vibe here – as trumpeter Dusko Goykovich leads a swinging sextet that includes Nathan Davis on flute, soprano, and tenor – blowing some tremendously soulful reed lines – plus incredible rhythms from Mal Waldron on piano, Peter Trunk on bass, and Cees See on drums.  The record's an attempt to bring traditional Macedonian rhythms into a jazz perspective – but with players like these, it swings in a way any Macedonian album never could – damn soulful, and with a great exotic vibe.  Davis is especially great, and plays in a soaring modal vein that's similar to his work on his classic MPS sides, and on the records he cut in America in the early 70s.  The album's a beautiful session that often get's overlooked because it blends it with the Enja catalog – but it's really more of a record that belongs in an MPS reissue series, and is a great lost groover that's waiting to be rediscovered by the Dusty Groove crowd.  Titles include "Macedonia", "Old Fisherman's Daughter", "Jumbo Uganda", "Bem Basha", "Saga Se karame", and "The Nights Of Skopje". LP, Vinyl record album

A wonderful session from the time when Mal Waldron was moving around the world a lot – having a profound influence on national jazz scenes in Italy, France, Japan, and elsewhere – and turning out great recordings like this!  This set's got a groove that's a bit more soulful than some of Waldron's other trio dates from the time – which could sometimes get a bit outside – and although Mal's somewhat free on the keys of the piano at points, there's a bold sense of rhythm to the record, thanks to bass from Patrice Caratini and drums from Guy Hayat.  Tracks are long and introspective, with almost a Randy Weston-ish style – and titles include "Down At The Gills", "La Petite Africaine", "My Funny Valentine", and "Blood & Guts". CD

Pivotal work from Waldron – stepping out of the blowing session mode, emerging as one of the 60s most striking moderinists.  Like a lot of Waldron's records from the time, this set shows an amazing desire for new forms and modern ideas, and the mix of players – Eric Dolphy, Booker Ervin, Ron Carter, Joe Benjamin, and Charlie Persip – pulls the material in a number of different ways.  Carter plays bowed cello, as he did on Dolphy's Out There session, and he gives the set a dark moody feel.  Ervin's in his best modernist mode, and he ably trades lines with Dolphy and keeps the whole thing moving nicely.  Waldron's writing and arranging is superb, and the tracks feature a lot of weird time structures and unusual modal patterns.  Includes the tracks "Status Seeking", "Warm Canto", "Warp and Woof", and "Fire Waltz". LP, Vinyl record album (Purple label New Jazz pressing, with Van Gelder stamp and deep groove on one side.)

A moody duet record that hearkens back to some of the recordings the pair did in the old days – with Lacy and Waldron playing lots of Monkish lines, especially on the side long 17 minute "Hooray for Herbie", which we assume is a tribute to Herbie Nichols.  Lacy's more inside than usual, and as with his other piano duet records, he shows that he's still a brilliant accompanist, with a good talent for sensitive playing that doesn't always show up in his solo albums, or his records as a leader.  Side 2 of the album features two more lengthy numbers:  "Herb de L'Oubli" and "Epistrophy". LP, Vinyl record album (Includes the insert and postcard.)

A great trio set from Waldron's early 70s European days of exploration – recorded live with Pierre Favre on drums, and the great Jimmy Woode on bass.  The combination of Favre's free modernism and Woode's soulful swing makes for a very interesting rhythm section – and Waldron, as he often did in this sort of session, dominates the proceedings with some moody and introspective work on the piano.  Titles include "The Call", "Sieg Haile", "MC", "La Gloire Du Noir", and "Rock My Soul". LP, Vinyl record album (US pressing.  Cover has a cut corner.)

A beautiful album by Mal Waldron – recorded in 1960, after the passing of Billie Holiday, and a very loving tribute by Waldron, who was her accompanist for a number of years.  The set moves way past the usual "Holiday songbook" mode, and features instead a dark batch of tracks, two written by Waldron – "Minor Pulsation" and "Cat Walk" – a third written by him and Holiday, the famous tune "Left Alone".  Jackie McLean plays some fantastic alto sax on the version of "Left Alone", and the rest of the tracks are trio tracks played by Waldron, Julian Euell, and Al Dreares.  The set also features one very strange track – "Mal Waldron:  The Way He Remembers Billie Holiday" – which is an interview with Waldron about Billie!  And sure, there were many cash-in records after Billie Holiday died, but this is one of the best, and it comes from a very legitimate source! LP, Vinyl record album (Red label pressing with deep groove.  Cover is stained about 2 inches along the spine, hardly visible on front, and a half split top seam.)

Bold genius from Mal Waldron – one of the key recordings he made during his years on the Parisian scene in the early 70s – a time when his talents and power grew tremendously!  The record has all the righteous promise you might guess from the title – long tracks that are filled with creative energy and strong lines on the piano – delivered in a way that's never too far outside, but which is markedly more unfettered than any previous Waldron work in the US!  The rest of the trio here features Noel McGhie on drums and Peter Warren on bass – both very able bandmates, and players who help Waldron really sharpen his sound.  Titles include "Reaching Out", "The Whirling Dervish", and "Walk". CD (Out of print.)

One of the best records Mal Waldron ever made, and a blinding hard bop session featuring a tight quintet with knock-down-dead front horn lines!  The record really follows strongly in the mode of some of Waldron's contributions to Prestige blowing sessions from the same period – but it's also got a much great focus and tightness – one that puts the record right up there with the best hardbop sides on Blue Note!  Gigi Gryce plays some razor-sharp alto on the session, Idrees Sulieman is on trumpet, and Waldron's piano is unusually soulful – with slight modern changes that really keep things interesting.  Tracks include "Shome", "Transfiguration", "Stablemates", and "Dee's Dilemma". LP, Vinyl record album (70s Japanese pressing – hard to find in any format!)

A sublime solo performance from Mal Waldron – the kind of unbridled, spiritual work he started giving us once he spent a lot of time overseas – sounds that are light years away from his American records of just a few short years before!  Waldron is incredible here – and his ability to work in different ways with each hand on the piano almost makes it feel as if the performance is a duet, instead of a solo – as Mal can lay down modal rhythms with one hand, create incredible flights on the keys with the other – all while holding onto a sense of rhythm and melody that's completely wonderful throughout.  Unlike some other Waldron records of this nature, which might go a bit outside – this one is free, but never "out" – and instead has Mal opening up beautifully on the titles "The Blues Suite", "Chairo No Hitomi", "The Stone Garden Of Ryoanji", "Summertime", "All Alone", and "Left Alone".

A fantastic run of work from pianist Mal Waldron – an artist who was already years ahead of his time when he broke on the scene in the 50s, but never got a chance to fully explore all of his many musical ideas until he formed a strong partnership with the Black Saint/Soul Note label in the 80s!  This huge set features 11 different albums, each one a slight variation on Waldron's talents – all records that are packaged here in individual record-style covers – so that you get a CD version of the albums as they originally appeared on the market.  Most of these are more intimate recordings – and the set includes one solo album, two duets each with David Friesen and Steve Lacy, albums with singers Judi Silvano, Tiziana Ghiglioni, and Kim Parker – a quartet date with Anthony Braxton, and another with Chico Freeman – and also one more trio album.  Includes the full albums Up & Down, Update, Sometimes I'm Blue, Sempre Amore, Dedication, Our Colline's A Treasure, I'll Be Around, Six Monk's Compositions, Communique, Riding A Zephyr, and Remembering Mal.

A stone classic from Gene Ammons – and a record that introduced his talents to a whole new audience in the 60s!  The album's a more laidback one than some of Jug's more hard-blown honkers – as you might guess from his hit rendition of the ballad in the title – and the instrumentation here varies between organ from Johnny Hammond Smith and piano from Mal Waldron – making for a nice tapestry of dark-tinged, late nite moods.  Other players include Frank Wess on tenor and flute, and Art Taylor or Ed Thigpen on drums.  Titles include the classic "Angel Eyes", plus "You Go To My Head" and "It's The Talk Of The Town" – and slightly more groovin numbers like "Getting Around" and "Water Jug". CD

Classic Jug, playing in a laidback open-ended blowing session, with other strong Prestige players – like Coltrane, Jerome Richardson, Paul Quinichette, Art Taylor, and Mal Waldron, who always seems to be the driving force between most Prestige sides like this.  The album has only 4 tracks, and they're all long and nice and soulful.  The titles are "Blue Hymn", "The Real McCoy", "Cheek To Cheek", and "That's All".

Way more than just an album with Gene Ammons as a leader – and instead, a set that truly earns the "all stars" listed on the cover – thanks to a great array of supporting players, and a very loose, open-ended jam session style that lets everyone get in plenty of solo space!  Ammons' tenor is tremendous, but he's also a great collaborator here, too – working with Idrees Suliman on trumpet, Pepper Adams on baritone, Mal Waldron on piano, Art Taylor on drums, Doug Watkins on bass, and Ray Barretto on conga – in a mode that's maybe slightly tighter than some of the blowing sessions Prestige was doing at the time, but which still has that key longform creative energy that made the hardbop generation so great.  Titles include "Blue Gene", "Scamperin", "Blue Greens n Beans", and "Hip Tip" – and all tracks are long, with plenty of focus on solos! CD

Ahhhh . . .  The Jam Session years of Gene Ammons!  This album was one of a number that Jug cut for Prestige during the mid 50s, all excellent examples of how perfectly the label's "blowing session" style could work when it wanted to.  The set takes Ammons' tenor, and groups it with an all-star cast that includes Art Farmer and Donald Byrd on trumpets, Jackie McLean on alto, Mal Waldron on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Art Taylor on drums.  All the horn players are given free reign to solo – and as most of the tracks go on and on and on, they really get room to open up, blowing with the kind of competitive creativity you'd hear in a live set at the same time.  Includes three long tracks:  "Not Really The Blues", "Jammin With Gene", and "We'll Be Together Again". LP, Vinyl record album (NYC 50th street label, with deep groove and RVG etch!  Cover has a split top seam, wear, and a few spots of aged tape on the seams.  Vinyl plays with clicks & crackles.)

Nice laid-back blowing session tracks for Prestige, ostensibly led by Donald Byrd and Kenny Burrell, though the label may just have been capitalizing on their names on the cover.

A beautiful tribute to the late, great Abbey Lincoln – served up on a host of solo piano performances by Marc Cary – mostly of tunes penned by Lincoln herself, but also featuring a few originals as well!  There's a rich, vibrant feel to the record – a quality that strikes us stronger than any other Cary recording we've heard in recent years, even though Marc's on his own here – really reaching out on the keys of the piano, with a command we never would have expected – stretching over space and tone with a sort of majesty to rival Mal Waldron or McCoy Tyner – yet also keeping things deeply personal as well.  Titles include "Melancholia", "Down Here Below", "Music Is The Magic", "Love Evolves", "Down Here Below The Horizon", "Transmute", "Throw It Away", and "Who Used To Dance". CD

Classic early John Coltrane for Prestige – less a bold statement as a leader than a strong batch of blowing session-styled tracks that show how well Coltrane could hold his own with more established players!  The groups on the set vary from track to track – and feature players that include Sahib Shihab, Mal Waldron, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Al Heath – plus underappreciated Philly trumpeter Johnnie Splawn.  Trane's in great form here – even though the overall set's a bit less structured than some of his later albums – and his tone and solo approach are already stepping out from the rest of the pack with great vigor!  Titles include "Bakai", "Time Was", "Straight Street", and "Chronic Blues". LP, Vinyl record album (Yellow & black label NYC pressing, with flat edge, deep groove, RVG stamp and AB etch.

Darkly brooding work from John Coltrane's early years as a leader on Prestige – a very unique little record that features twin baritone sax support from Pepper Adams and Cecil Payne!  Both players are wonderfully hip here – more than enough to match Trane's unique musical vision for the group's format – and the sound of the session is much edgier than some of his other Prestige work – which may be why the label chose not to issue it until 1963, even though it was recorded back in '57.  There's a nice roughness here – the same inspirational early sound you'll get on Coltrane's early sides for Savoy or Imperial – and other players include Mal Waldron on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Art Taylor on drums.  Titles include "Cat Walk", "Dakar", "Route 4", "Velvet Scene", and "Witches Pit". LP, Vinyl record album (German OJC pressing.  Cover has an unglued top seam.)

Strong work – even if the album is sort of a collection of tracks that Trane recorded for Prestige, instead of a discreet album.  The 2LP set is from the mid 70s – and combines tracks originally issued on the albums Lush Life and Coltrane.  Side one of Lush Life features Coltrane's tenor in a spare setting with Earl May on bass and Art Taylor on drums – playing mellow tunes like "I Love You" and "Like Someone In Love", as well as the original "Trane's Slow Blues".  Side two features a blowing session mode – with Donald Byrd, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Louis Hayes – on the cuts "Lush Life" and "I Hear A Rhapsody".  Coltrane is a classic set for Prestige – a set of blowing session tracks with Trane in the lead, featuring players like Sahib Shihab, Mal Waldron, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Al Heath.    Trane's in great form here – even though the overall set's a bit less structured than some of his later albums – and his tone and solo approach are already stepping out from the rest of the pack with great vigor!

A 2LP set that expands on tunes originally issued on the Coltrane/Mal Waldron albums The Dealers and Wheelin & Dealin – both featuring material recorded in 1957, with Coltrane on tenor, and a rhythm section that features Waldron, Doug Watkins, and Art Taylor.  The tracks are open-ended and very much in the blowing session mode that Waldron perfected for Prestige – solidly rhythmic, and quite cohesive, yet also very open-handed in the way that each player is allowed space for solo expression.  Paul Quinichette and Frank Wess perform on 3 sides of the set, and the last one features Jackie McLean and Bill Hardman taking their place.  Includes 2 takes each of "Wheelin" and "Dealin", plus "Blue Calypso", "Falling In Love With Love", "Robbin's Nest", and "Things Ain't What They Used To Be".

Searing live work from Eric Dolphy – part of a series of recordings that set a whole new standard for live jazz recording!  The record features Dolphy going even farther out than on his studio sides from the time – as the record features very long tracks performed by a crack group that includes Booker Little on trumpet, Mal Waldron on piano, Richard Davis on bass, and Ed Blackwell on drums.  Despite the length of the tracks, Dolphy isn't as far out as on later European live recordings – but the performance is a great example of his inventiveness within a mainstream structure, and the modernist tendencies of both Waldron and Little shine very brightly in the set.  The concert was one of Little's last (and greatest) recordings – sometimes billed as a "memorial", even though he was still alive when it was done – and titles on this volume include "Aggression" and "Like Someone In Love".

Sort of a "house cleaning" album, one in which Prestige collected together a number of unissued Dolphy tracks after his death – but still a strong one, and in a way, the record features music that's even a bit more far-reaching than some of the studio albums on Prestige.  Dolphy plays a solo bass clarinet version of "God Bless The Child";  he plays with Booker Little and Mal Waldron on "Status Seeking";  he's on flute in a quartet with Jaki Byard on "April Fool";  and he plays with a pickup Danish rhythm section on an alternate take of "Don't Blame Me".

Think what you want about the tuba – Ray Draper is an incredible talent, and probably the only individual to make the instrument work in jazz!  Draper played with both John Coltrane and Jackie McLean during the late 50s – and this rare album features him leading a group with McLean on alto, Mal Waldron on piano, and Webster Young on trumpet.  The sound is quite dark – with the heavy-hanging blue notes that you'll find on the best late 50s Prestige blowing sessions – and in a way, the overall feel is more similar to some of the work that McLean and Waldron did together, than it is to anything else.  In other words, you're in for a modernist hardbop treat – with lots of rich surprises, and a deeply emotional approach to playing that makes the music timeless, whatever the instrumentation.  Titles include "House Of Davis", "Terry Anne", "Pivot", and "Jackie's Dolly". LP, Vinyl record album (Yellow & black label NYC pressing, with deep groove, RVG stamp, and AB etch.

Two of the biggest singers who ever worked for Verve Records – captured perfectly at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1957!  Ella Fitzgerald steps out with a strong, lively groove on the first half of the set – swinging things with a looser, more upbeat quality than on some of her mellower Verve studio sets of the late 50s – really grooving it up with small combo backing from the trio of pianist Don Abney!  Billie Holiday also gets some small combo backing too – a hip trio with Mal Waldron on piano, Joe Benjamin on bass, and Jo Jones on drums – often a bit more laidback than the group on Ella's sides, but in a great way that helps Holiday hit a very intimate sound, even before this large audience.  Ella sings "This Can't Be Love", "Body & Soul", "April In Paris", "I Got A Crush On You", and "Airmail Special" – and Billie sings "Nice Work If You Can Get It", "What A Little Moonlight Can Do", "My Man", "Willow Weep For Me", and "Lady Sings The Blues".

Billie Holiday also gets some small combo backing too – a hip trio with Mal Waldron on piano, Joe Benjamin on bass, and Jo Jones on drums – often a bit more laidback than the group on Ella's sides, but in a great way that helps Holiday hit a very intimate sound, even before this large audience.  Ella sings "This Can't Be Love", "Body & Soul", "April In Paris", "I Got A Crush On You", and "Airmail Special" – and Billie sings "Nice Work If You Can Get It", "My Man", "Willow Weep For Me", and "Lady Sings The Blues".

One of the rare few albums from vocalist Mary Ann McCall – a hell of a great singer, and one with a really moody, dark style!  Mary Ann's got all the sad tones and blue hues we love in June Christy's best work – and she arguably works with even hipper backings, too – some inventive small group material that mixes performances by Teddy Charles on vibes, Mal Waldron on piano, and Jimmy Raney on guitar with some occasional violin and viola – used sparingly, and worked into these very offbeat arrangements that make the album unlike anything else we can think of – and every bit as striking as the title and cover!  Tunes include "Detour Ahead", "Blue Moon", "Moonlight Becomes You", "Moon Country", "East Of The Sun", and "The Moon Was Yellow". CD (SHM-CD pressing!)

An unusual title, but one that refers to Jackie McLean in quartet, quintet, and sextet formation – a growing lineup that develops along the course of the record, as new players are added into the mix with a casual, almost blowing session approach!  The set begins with Jackie's alto set out in spare territory with Mal Waldron on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Art Taylor on drums – plenty of space to solo on "Sentimental Journey" and "Why Was I Born" with sharp changes and deeply soulful tones that really push past the conventions of the tunes – and as the record moves on, Hank Mobley steps in on tenor and Donald Byrd on trumpet – expanding out the sound for nicely-blown versions of"Abstraction", "Confirmation", and "Contour".

Long-blowing late 50s work from Jackie McLean – one of his standout sets as a leader from the pre-Blue Note years!   The album features McLean in two different settings – really opening up on side one with a sextet that includes Curtis Fuller on trombone, Webster Young on trumpet, Gil Coggins on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Louis Hayes on drums – in two long takes of "A Long Drink Of The Blues", which features Jackie on both alto and tenor!  Side two is a bit tighter, with Jackie heading up a quartet that includes Mal Waldron on piano, Art Phipps on bass, and Art Taylor on drums – on tunes that include "I Cover The Waterfront", "These Foolish Things", and "Embraceable You". LP, Vinyl record album (Orange label Status pressing with RVG stamp.)

$7.99

Add to Cart
A great 2LP set that brings together both of the Jackie McLean albums that were recorded for Jubilee in the late 50s!  Fat Jazz is one of the few Jackie McLean albums to feature his sextet with Ray Draper.  Draper was the amazing tuba player who recorded with Coltrane, and his presence here adds much to the session – as do his two compositions "Filide" and "Two Sons".  Webster Young plays coronet, Gil Coggins plays piano, and George Tucker's on drums.  Also features a recording of Young's "Millie's Pad".  The second session, the Jackie McLean Quintet, features a great batch of straight ahead hardbop tracks, performed with Donald Byrd, Mal Waldron, and Doug Watkins.  The set includes two of Jackie's best compositions from the 50's – "Blue Doll" and "Little Melonae" – plus a great track by Mal Waldron called "Mood Malody".  The LP's got excellent playing throughout, and has a nice dark edge to it that points at McLean's later modernist moments! LP, Vinyl record album (Cover has light wear.)

A classic session of modernist jazz – and some of Mingus most groundbreaking early work!  The album was recorded for Savoy with 2 different groups – one's got Mingus leading John LaPorta on alto, Teo Macero on tenor, and Mal Waldron on piano, and the other group's a quartet with Macero, Kenny Clarke, and Wally Cirillo.  The set marks a strong shift for Mingus – into tightly composed tracks that arc out in complex lines, hinting at the ferocity of later years – and it offers a showcase for a strong set of soloists carefully picked to match Mingus' rich vision.  Titles include "Gregarian Chant", "Rose Geranium", "Purple Heart", "Transeason", "Smog L.A.", and "Level Seven".  CD also features one bonus track not on the original LP – a previously unissued version of "Body & Soul" cut during the same sessions! CD (Out of print.)

Seminal early work from Charles Mingus – a session that really shows him beginning to work in tightly arranged, deeply resonant styles – pushing much more deeply towards the brilliance of the late 50s!  The set's recorded with a great lineup that includes Mal Waldron, Max Roach, and the enigmatic George Barrow on tenor – and includes a fantastic reading of "Percussion Discussion", played here by Roach and Mingus as a drum and bass duet (as opposed to Roach solo, as on a later version.)  Also features the brilliant "All The Things You C-Sharp", a pivotal track in the Mingus book, and one of our favorites ever by him – plus "Septemberly", "Work Song", and "Jump Monk". LP, Vinyl record album (Original Debut pressing.  Label on Side A has come detached, but is included.  Cover has clear tape on the seams and some light runny ink on back.)

$44.99

Add to Cart
An amazing record – quite possibly one of the greatest jazz albums of all time, and a session that has Charles Mingus stepping boldly forward in a whole new direction!  The album shakes loose the sometimes too-academic modern tones of Mingus albums from the previous year or two – and unleashes the bold, raw emotion that would drive him firmly into the 60s – a new sense of freedom in music, filled with poetry, anger, joy, and life!  The tracks are all quite long – and played by a sharp quintet with Mingus on bass, Jackie McLean on alto sax, JR Monterose on tenor, Mal Waldron on piano, and Willie Jones on drums.  Titles include "Pithecantrhopus Erectus", "A Foggy Day", "Love Chant", and "Profile of Jackie".  The whole thing bubbles over with an anger and intensity that you hardly find in other Mingus albums, and if you've ever heard a weak Mingus album, and wondered what all the fuss was about, you owe it to yourself to own this one!  We promise that it will never ever let you down. LP, Vinyl record album (Nice Japanese pressing!)

Stunning!  This is a beautiful album that's one of Max Roach's most powerful recordings, and a record that's been the inspiration for countless other imitations over the years.  Roach leads a group with Richard Williams, Clifford Jordan, and Mal Waldron – and they're matched with a vocal chorus led by Coleridge Perkinson, who also did the arrangements for Donald Byrd's classic "with voices" albums.  Unlike those, though, this set's a damn angry bunch of compositions, and the chorus wails away in a loud screaming powerful mode that will blow away any of your preconceptions about the "with voices" mode.  The group sings wordless vocals (except for one cut, which has Abbey Lincoln singing in the lead), and provides a searing backdrop of sound for the band's razor sharp playing.  Every cut's a winner, and the whole thing's a masterpiece!  Titles include "The Profit", "It's Time", and "Another Valley". CD (Out of print.)

One of Frank Wess' strongest albums from the time – a harder-than-usual burner recorded with Kenny Burrell on guitar, plus Thad Jones trumpet, Mal Waldron piano, and rhythm by Paul Chambers and Art Taylor.  Tracks are long and very jamming – almost in the mode of the Prestige blowing sessions of a few years hence, especially when Wess is playing tenor.

Sublime late 50s hardbop – recorded in the best Prestige blowing session mode!  The record has an incredibly open-ended feel – as you might probably guess from the track "All Night Long", which runs for all of side one, and gives all the players included plenty of room to work out their best solo moments!  Members of the group here include Kenny Burrell on guitar, Hank Mobley on tenor, Jerome Richardson on flute and tenor, Donald Byrd on trumpet, and Mal Waldron on piano – really holding the whole thing together with his dark lines on the keys!  The groove is laidback, but never sloppy – and the spaciousness of side one is matched by 3 shorter tracks on side two – "Boo Lu", "Flickers", and "Little Hankie". LP, Vinyl record album (Yellow and black label NJ pressing, with deep groove and RVG etch in the blue tinted cover.  Cover has a split bottom seam held with tape, a peeled spot in the top right corner held with tape, & some stains.)

Searing live work from Eric Dolphy – part of a series of recordings that set a whole new standard for live jazz recording!  The record features Dolphy going even farther out than on his studio sides from the time – as the record features very long tracks performed by a crack group that includes Booker Little on trumpet, Mal Waldron on piano, Richard Davis on bass, and Ed Blackwell on drums.  Despite the length of the tracks, Dolphy isn't as far out as on later European live recordings – but the performance is a great example of his inventiveness within a mainstream structure, and the modernist tendencies of both Waldron and Little shine very brightly in the set.  The concert was one of Little's last (and greatest) recordings – sometimes billed as a "memorial", even though he was still alive when it was done – and titles on this volume include "Fire Waltz", "Like Someone In Love", "Aggression", and "The Prophet". CD (Out of print.)

One of the first-ever albums to feature the tenor talents of Billy Harper as a leader – recorded at a time when the world was really awakening to his talents – thanks to work with Max Roach, Art Blakey, and Lee Morgan!  The album features one of Harper's classic groups – with Everett Hollins on trumpet, Fred Hersch on piano, Louis "Mbiki" Spears on bass, and Horacee Arnold on drums – stretching out with a sense of joy, power, and righteousness that perfectly sum up Harper's contribution to jazz at the time – a new sort of spiritualism allowed by the previous presence of John Coltrane – yet voiced in a mode that's all Billy's own!  The set was recorded during a great burst of creative energy on the French Futura label – at a time when they were recording other excellent American players like Ted Curson, Mal Waldron, and Chris Woods – all with an approach that makes them just the right match to capture Harper's early voice at its best.  The record features a great version of "Soran Bushi B.H." – a soulful spiritual number that's one of Harper's best compositions – plus "The Awakening", and the super-long "Cry Of Hunger". CD

One of the few 50s small group sessions recorded by Teo Macero as a leader – and one of the best!  Macero's probably better known both for his work as an arranger, and as a producer of famous albums at bigger labels – but here, he's working with a quintet in a laidback vibe that really showcases his talents on the tenor saxophone!  The sound is quite modern – with Teddy Charles on vibes and Mal Waldron on piano – both working in more angular styles, with lots of tones and chromes that recall their own best work as leaders at the time.  And Macero's horn cuts through these instruments with a sometimes-soulful edge, similar to some of the use of tenor in Charles Mingus' work of the period (no surprise, as Macero had worked with Mingus!)  Titles include "What's Not", "Polody", "Ghost Story", "Please Don't Go Now", and "Just Spring". LP, Vinyl record album (A stunning original pressing – 50th street NYC label, deep groove, RVG etch – and beautiful vinyl!  Front cover looks great – almost perfect, save for one spot in the corner – and back has some light aging, but no writing.)

A really unique little session from Jackie McLean – and one of the few 50s jazz albums to feature the talents of tuba player Ray Draper, a vastly under-rated artist who recorded briefly with McLean and Coltrane at the time!  Although the tuba might seem like a heavy instrument to bring into jazz, Draper's way of handling it is really wonderful – as he works the tuba's round, warm, bassy tunes in a way that's somewhere between a trombone and an acoustic bass – yet which also has some surprisingly light and lyrical moments as well.  Draper's only on about half the album's tracks, but his presence on the set is really great – and McLean, as usual, really shines throughout.  Other players include Bill Hardman on trumpet, Mal Waldron on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Art Taylor on drums – and titles include "Beau Jack", "Mirage", "Flickers", "Help", and "Minor Dream".

A sharp set from trumpet player Jeremy Pelt on High Note – backed by JD Allen on tenor sax, Danny Grissett on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums – the same group that played in the equally great Men Of Honor set.  It's great mix of exciting solos within solid, soulfully inclined framework.  We love it when modern players express themselves creatively and show such dexterous ability in way that's both indebted to and honorable of the 60s post bop and early soul jazz forbears. Nice stuff!     Includes Pelt's own "Pandora's Box", "All My Thoughts Are Of You", "When The Time Is Right", "Only" and "David And Goliath" – plus "Paradise Lost", "In Love Again" and Mal Waldron's "Pulse".

A perfect example of the great skill that Prestige had for taking a good ensemble player, and putting him into a context that really let him open up in a manner that brought his best points to light!  In this case, Quinichette's plucked from Basie's group and put with a tight bunch of soulful players like Sonny Red, John Jenkins, Curtis Fuller, and Mal Waldron – all of whom are very well trained to handle this sort of pickup session well.  Tracks are long, and titles include "Cool-Lypso", "Circles", and "Blue Dots". LP, Vinyl record album (OJC pressing.  Cover and labels have some marker.)

Think the French new wave had a lock on jazz soundtracks?  Think again, because the Japanese scene of the 60s was full of them – including this sublime set from 1963!  Most numbers here are jazz tracks played by a great small combo – one that's got tremendous energy all the way through!  The players are unfortunately not credited – but there's great baritone sax, vibes, Hammond, and other instrumentation on these numbers – most of which feel more like evocative performances by a group in a small club, than they do any sort of standard soundtrack music!  The whole thing's beautiful – rich in feeling and color, almost like some of the Mal Waldron or Charles Mingus soundtrack performances – and the CD features 20 tracks in all, with notes and other information in Japanese.

Jackie McLean's got a great pal here – trumpeter Bill Hardman, who'd work with Jackie in the Jazz Messengers a year later!  Here, the pals are cutting sharp lines in a perfect early hardbop mode – a great Prestige session with big bold sound from Rudy Van Gelder, and fresh modern tones from the rhythm section of Mal Waldron on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums!  Both McLean's alto and Hardman's trumpet get plenty of space to open up and ring out in a very personal voice – and titles include "Dee's Dilemma", "Sublues", "Just For Marty", and "Sweet Doll".

Sweet and to-the-point work from a young Jackie McLean – the kind of hard-burning yet slightly-modern work he recorded best for Prestige in the late 50s!  The album's a bit of a blowing session outing – with 2 different group, one a sextet with Curtis Fuller, Webster Young, and Gil Coggins;  the other a quartet with Mal Waldron on piano – but thanks to the strong tone and vision of Jackie, there's a really unified feel to the set, and an edginess that makes the whole thing hang together nicely.   The tracks are long and soulful, and recorded with a resonant quality that makes the tunes echo out even more.  Titlesinclude "Bean & The Boys", "Jackie's Ghost", "I Never Knew", and "Chasin' The Bird". LP, Vinyl record album (NOTE: POOR CONDITION.  Purple label New Jazz pressing with RVG etch/stamp.

A moody session led by vibist Teddy Charles – in an amazing style that mixes up some of the hardbop styles of the Prestige blowing sessions with Charles' own modernist love of tone and color!  The album's got a dark sensibility that really sets it apart from a lot of other Prestige albums of the time – heart to best effect in Charles' unique approach to the vibes, but sounding equally great in the piano work of Mal Waldron, and in Idrees Suliman's lofty trumpet lines.

Blue Note boy genius Jason Moran rolls forward with another fine set for the label – leading a quartet session with a keen ear for 40s deep south jazz with groundwork in the blues – without sacrificing the freedom and fervor of bop or more contemporary sounds!  Moran's been moving very well for a few years in the comfort of his great trio, featuring Tarus Mateen on bass and Nasheet Waits on the kit – this time adding a stellar guitar in Marvin Sewell.  It's only appropriate that the measured piano firebrand would jump back a couple generations after lending his attention to hip hop and electro on the last studio album – and he does so with the same geniune passion, and perhaps even more appealing results! Tracks include "Gangsterism On The Rise", "Jump Up", "Aubade", "G Suit Saltation", "I'll Play The Blues For You", Mal Waldron's hot "Fire Waltz", "Field Of The Dead", "Restin'", "Gangsterism On The Set" and more.

                    One of the rarest Mal Waldron albums ever – issued on a tiny label, as part of its education series – but a great trio date with George Tucker on bass and Al Dreares on percussion! (Great Japanese pressing – with obi!)  © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 





    We realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used
    for pre-owned vinyl record albums & CD, so we thought we'd offer you the ones that we are working with,
    so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a non-new item on our pages.

Used Vinyl Grades

    Below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at Dusty Groove. Grading for
    the cover should be assumed to be near (within a "+" or "-")
    the grading for the vinyl.
    If there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl, or specific flaws,
    these will be noted in the comments section of the item. However, please be aware that
    since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener, our main concern is with
    the vinyl of any used item we sell. Additionally, please note that all of our records
    are graded visually; considering the volume of used vinyl we handle, it is impossible
    for us to listen to each record. If we spot any significant flaws, we make every attempt
    to listen through them and note how they play.


    The following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single:



Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.

Live At The Lighthouse

Prestige,  1972.  Very Good

One To Get Ready – Four To Go

Revelation,  1965.  Very Good+ 

LP...$8.99

Oblivion Express

Gin & Orange

Cadet,  1969.  Very Good

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping.
