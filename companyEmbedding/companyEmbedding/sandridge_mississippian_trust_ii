      SANDRIDGE MISSISSIPPIAN TRUST II (NYSE: SDR) today announced a quarterly 
      distribution for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 (which 
      primarily relates to production attributable to the Trust’s interests 
      from March 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017) of $2.5 million, or $0.050 per unit. 
      The Trust makes distributions on a quarterly basis on or about the 60th 
      day following the completion of each quarter. The distribution is 
      expected to occur on or before August 25, 2017 to holders of record as 
      of the close of business on August 11, 2017.
    

      During the three-month production period ended May 31, 2017, combined 
      sales volumes were slightly lower than the previous period and oil, 
      natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) prices decreased. As no 
      additional development wells will be drilled, the Trust’s production is 
      expected to decline each quarter during the remainder of its life.
    

      The Trust owns royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in 
      the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Grant, Kay, Noble and Woods 
      counties in northern Oklahoma and Barber, Comanche, Harper and Sumner 
      counties in southern Kansas and is entitled to receive proceeds from the 
      sale of production attributable to the royalty interests. As described 
      in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
      “SEC”), the amount of the quarterly distributions is expected to 
      fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by 
      the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil, natural gas and 
      NGL prices and the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative 
      expenses, among other factors. All Trust unitholders share distributions 
      on a pro rata basis.
    

      Volumes, price and distributable income available to unitholders for the 
      period were (dollars in thousands, except per unit):

      Pursuant to IRC Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively 
      connected to a United States trade or business allocated to foreign 
      partners should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under Section 
      1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income 
      from United States sources allocated to foreign partners should be made 
      at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. This is 
      intended to be a qualified notice by SandRidge Mississippian Trust II to 
      nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 
      1.1446-4(b), and while specific relief is not specified for Section 1441 
      income, this disclosure is intended to suffice. Nominees and brokers 
      should withhold at the highest marginal rate, currently 39.6% for 
      individuals, on the distribution made to foreign partners.
    

      This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking 
      statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, 
      other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking 
      statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking 
      statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution 
      to unit holders. The anticipated distribution is based, in part, on the 
      amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from 
      SandRidge Energy, Inc. (“SandRidge”) with respect to the relevant 
      period. Any differences in actual cash receipts by the Trust could 
      affect this distributable amount. The amount of such cash received or 
      expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay 
      distributions) has been and will be significantly and negatively 
      impacted by prevailing low commodity prices, which could remain low for 
      an extended period of time or decline further. Other important factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of 
      the Trust and reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made 
      in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in 
      this press release. Neither SandRidge nor the Trustee intends, and 
      neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included 
      in this press release. An investment in Common Units issued by SandRidge 
      Mississippian Trust II is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s 
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all 
      of its other filings with the SEC. The Trust’s quarterly and other filed 
      reports are or will be available over the Internet at the SEC’s web site 
      at http://www.sec.gov.

I’m Selling Sandridge Mississippian Trust II
This commodity investment didn't pan out











                Jim Royal
            

                (TMFRoyal)



            
            Mar 21, 2014 at 3:08PM
            
            





Oscar Wilde once said that experience is the name we give to our mistakes. My investment in Sandridge Mississippian Trust II (NYSE:SDR) has been the greatest experience of my Special Situations portfolio. But in investing, as in life, to be successful you must make the next right decision, rather than foolishly holding to a past commitment that has been proven wrong. So I've decided to sell my shares in this troubled royalty trust and move on to find a good investment. (I've got a good one here.)
Ouch, that hurts This investment has been painful, mitigated only by the relatively small stake I took and the ongoing stream of distributions. I purchased shortly after the IPO at $22.20 per share. It was all downhill from there.
After Thursday's close, the stock is down to $7.34, or about 67%. The only salve is the cash distributions totaling $4.25. The overall return comes to -48%. Bad work if you can get it.
It's the second year in a row that the trust has recorded a significant downward revision in reserves. Increasingly the trust is relying on selling natural gas and liquids, as opposed to oil, as previously indicated in the prospectus. That is lowering royalties, which hurts cash distributions over time.
Foolish takeaway With little reason to expect things to change now, I'm selling Sandridge Mississippian Trust II and will move the proceeds into other stocks that have a good shot at outperformance.

      SANDRIDGE MISSISSIPPIAN TRUST II (NYSE: SDR) today announced a quarterly 
      distribution for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 (which 
      primarily relates to production attributable to the Trust’s interests 
      from March 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017) of $2.5 million, or $0.050 per unit. 
      The Trust makes distributions on a quarterly basis on or about the 60th 
      day following the completion of each quarter. The distribution is 
      expected to occur on or before August 25, 2017 to holders of record as 
      of the close of business on August 11, 2017.
    

      During the three-month production period ended May 31, 2017, combined 
      sales volumes were slightly lower than the previous period and oil, 
      natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) prices decreased. As no 
      additional development wells will be drilled, the Trust’s production is 
      expected to decline each quarter during the remainder of its life.
    

      The Trust owns royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in 
      the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Grant, Kay, Noble and Woods 
      counties in northern Oklahoma and Barber, Comanche, Harper and Sumner 
      counties in southern Kansas and is entitled to receive proceeds from the 
      sale of production attributable to the royalty interests. As described 
      in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
      “SEC”), the amount of the quarterly distributions is expected to 
      fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by 
      the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil, natural gas and 
      NGL prices and the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative 
      expenses, among other factors. All Trust unitholders share distributions 
      on a pro rata basis.
    

      Volumes, price and distributable income available to unitholders for the 
      period were (dollars in thousands, except per unit):

      Pursuant to IRC Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively 
      connected to a United States trade or business allocated to foreign 
      partners should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under Section 
      1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income 
      from United States sources allocated to foreign partners should be made 
      at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. This is 
      intended to be a qualified notice by SandRidge Mississippian Trust II to 
      nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 
      1.1446-4(b), and while specific relief is not specified for Section 1441 
      income, this disclosure is intended to suffice. Nominees and brokers 
      should withhold at the highest marginal rate, currently 39.6% for 
      individuals, on the distribution made to foreign partners.
    

      This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking 
      statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, 
      other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking 
      statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking 
      statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution 
      to unit holders. The anticipated distribution is based, in part, on the 
      amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from 
      SandRidge Energy, Inc. (“SandRidge”) with respect to the relevant 
      period. Any differences in actual cash receipts by the Trust could 
      affect this distributable amount. The amount of such cash received or 
      expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay 
      distributions) has been and will be significantly and negatively 
      impacted by prevailing low commodity prices, which could remain low for 
      an extended period of time or decline further. Other important factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of 
      the Trust and reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made 
      in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in 
      this press release. Neither SandRidge nor the Trustee intends, and 
      neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included 
      in this press release. An investment in Common Units issued by SandRidge 
      Mississippian Trust II is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s 
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all 
      of its other filings with the SEC. The Trust’s quarterly and other filed 
      reports are or will be available over the Internet at the SEC’s web site 
      at http://www.sec.gov.
