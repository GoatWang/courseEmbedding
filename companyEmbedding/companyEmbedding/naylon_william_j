 Career History



Executive Vice President Chief Operating Officer

                                    1995 - Current                


PriceSmart, Inc.


                  PriceSmart, Inc. engages in the international management and operation of membership warehouse clubs. It operates through the following geographical segments: Latin America, Caribbean, and the United States. Its offers retail products and caters services such as bakery, food court, and tire center. The company was founded by Sol Price and Robert Price in 1994 and is headquartered San Diego, CA.                




General Manager

                                    Prior                


Costco Wholesale Corporation


                  What Is Costco?

We are a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing our members the best possible prices on quality brand-name merchandise. With hundreds of locations worldwide, Costco provides a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all designed to make your shopping experience a pleasurable one.
The History of Costco

The company's first location, opened in 1976 under the Price Club name, was in a converted airplane hangar on Morena Boulevard in San Diego. Originally serving only small businesses, the company found it could achieve far greater buying clout by also serving a selected audience of non-business members. With that change, the growth of the warehouse club industry was off and running. In 1983, the first Costco warehouse location was opened in Seattle. Costco became the first company ever to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less than six years. When Costco and Price Club merged in 1993, the combined company, operating under the name PriceCostco, had 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.

Our operating philosophy has been simple. Keep costs down and pass the savings on to our members. Our large membership base and tremendous buying power, combined with our never-ending quest for efficiency, result in the best possible prices for our members. Since resuming the Costco name in 1997, the company has grown worldwide with total sales in recent fiscal years exceeding $64 billion
