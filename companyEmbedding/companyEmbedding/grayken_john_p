The majority of Grayken's fortune is derived from his control of closely held Lone Star Funds, a private equity firm that invests in distressed debt. He's credited with all of the company, based on the 2015 accounts of Lone Star Europe Acquisitions, which state that he's the "ultimate controlling party." He was also identified as the sole shareholder in a Schedule 13D filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The firm has raised about $70 billion from investors since it began in 1995 and has bought assets with an aggregate price of about $179 billion, according to the company's website and data compiled by Bloomberg. The value of assets under management isn't disclosed. It's calculated to be $90 billion based on the ratio of assets under management to the total purchase price of assets disclosed in a report on Lone Star by consultant Courtland Partners to the board of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Employees' Retirement Plan in August 2010.
Lone Star was valued using the average price-to-assets under management multiple of two publicly traded peer companies: Apollo and Oaktree.
Grayken personally invested $680 million into two Lone Star Funds, according to the minutes of meetings with two of the funds' institutional investors. The investments are valued at their disclosed amount.
Hudson Advisors, an affiliate asset-management company owned by Grayken, is valued as part of Lone Star.
He also owns properties in the England, Switzerland and the U.S. They're valued according to reports in the Irish Independent and Boston Globe.
Joseph Sala, a spokesman for Lone Star at New York-based Joele Frank Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher PR, said Grayken declined to comment on his net worth.

An Investment Firm That Prospered From Past Crises Turns to Mortgages

John P. Grayken made a fortune buying investments no one else seemed to want during the savings and loan debacle in the early 1990s. Now he is trying to repeat that feat by buying the detritus of today’s mortgage crisis.On Monday night, Mr. Grayken’s private investment company, Lone Star Funds, agreed to pay $6.2 billion for most of the toxic, mortgage-linked investments held by Merrill Lynch.The deal was classic Grayken: Lone Star, which has a long history of swooping down on troubled assets, paid 22 cents on the dollar for investments with a face value of nearly $31 billion.  Mr. Grayken’s firm even got Merrill to finance 75 percent of the purchase price. If the investments turn out to be worthless, Merrill, not Lone Star, will be on the hook for most of the losses.As Wall Street sized up the sale on Tuesday, the verdict among analysts was nearly unanimous: Lone Star drove a hard bargain.

“This is a good deal,” said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.In the Merrill deal, Lone Star was treading on familiar territory. Mr. Grayken, 52, made his mark buying bad mortgages from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the government-owned asset management company that liquidated assets of failed S.& L.’s during the early 1990s. He has raised roughly $23 billion since 1995 to buy distressed financial and real estate assets around the globe. Continue reading the main story

Bad loans might strike many people as poor investments. But the business of trading distressed debt is undergoing a renaissance on Wall Street, as money managers and traders search for ways to profit from fears that defaults will keep rising on a wide range of consumer and corporate loans.Companies like Lone Star — vulture investors is Wall Street’s term —  root through loan files and try to determine how much the debt is worth. If the vultures buy the loans,  they then seek to recoup that value, either by working out the loans with borrowers, pushing the properties through foreclosure or holding on to them until they can be sold. The process is slow and requires navigating the pitfalls of mortgage lending, such as understanding predatory lending laws.“You have to be smart about how you diligence these loans,” said Louis Pizante, the chief executive officer of Mavent Inc., a company that provides automated regulatory compliance to the mortgage industry. “There’s a lot of amateur money out there.”Lone Star, however, is no amateur.  It stands out for its expertise in working out mortgages on houses, apartments and offices.

“Lone Star has its origins in working the real estate up; they would buy a portfolio of loans and build a large platform of people who would work through every loan, case by case,” said Brad Child, senior real estate investment officer for the office of the Oregon state treasurer, which has invested about $1 billion with Lone Star over the years. “It’s a very granular business, and they’ve been at this for years.”Lone Star has an affiliate, Hudson Advisors, that works out individual loans and mortgages. Hudson employs about 800 of the firm’s 900 workers worldwide. Mr. Child said Oregon’s investments have returned more than the 20 percent goal set by Lone Star.After a chain reaction of devaluations, defaults and recession rocked East Asia in the late 1990s, Lone Star became one of South Korea’s largest foreign investors. Mr. Grayken’s firm bought everything from troubled loans to a controlling interest in the Korea Exchange Bank, which it purchased in 2003 for $1.2 billion. Lone Star remains a major investor in Japan, where it has acquired everything from banks to golf courses. It has also moved aggressively into Germany, where Deutsche Post World Net, a logistics company, recently sold the firm a portfolio of 1,300 properties for 1 billion euros.

Now Lone Star is hunting for bargains in its own backyard by buying  in the residential real estate market in the United States, investors in its funds say.

Continue reading the main story

Mr. Grayken grew up around Boston, graduated from Harvard Business School and worked in Morgan Stanley’s real estate department before teaming up with the Texas billionaire Robert Bass in the early 1990s. Mr. Grayken cut his teeth running Brazos, an entity formed by the Resolution Trust Corporation and Mr. Bass to buy up and work out troubled mortgages from savings and loans. Brazos ultimately posted a 77 percent return on its portion of the portfolio.Mr. Grayken was soon off to the races, raising his own funds and scouring the globe for investments. He renounced his United States citizenship in 1999 and moved to London; he now splits his time between the United States and London, said a person familiar with his situation.Lone Star’s expertise makes it a popular destination for opportunistic investors. The group just raised two funds, both of which were oversubscribed: Lone Star VI was slated to be $5 billion and the group raised $7.5 billion; the principals aimed to raise $1.5 billion for a real estate fund and closed with roughly $2.5 billion.Their timing seems impeccable. Banks have been reluctant to sell large portions of their portfolios at available prices. But shareholders have suffered through four painful quarters, and other banks may follow Merrill’s lead and try to offload their toxic securities.People briefed on Lone Star’s plans say the firm views Merrill’s decision to sell at such low prices as a sea change in the way banks are approaching their holdings of troubled investments. Lone Star expects other banks to come knocking — and it is ready to buy, for the right price. “They are not satiated,” said one person who is not authorized to talk about the funds’ goals.In recent months, Lone Star funds or affiliates spent $1.5 billion to buy the home lending business from the CIT Group (the Lone Star funds also assumed debt and liabilities) and acquired the operating assets or rights to operating assets of the Bear Stearns Residential Mortgage Corporation.To be sure, things have not always gone smoothly for Lone Star. Its decision to sell its stake in Korea Exchange Bank to HSBC in 2007 prompted accusations of stock manipulation and led to a top Lone Star executive’s being sentenced to five  years in prison.  A Seoul appeals court overturned the verdict in June.

History[edit]
Lone Star was founded by John Grayken.[8] From 1993 to 1995, Mr. Grayken was Chairman and CEO of Brazos Partners L.P., a joint venture between the Robert M. Bass Group and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,[9] that resolved approximately 1,300 “bad bank” assets resulting from the U.S. savings and loan crisis in the early ‘90s.[10] During this period, Brazos Advisors LLC was formed to provide asset-management and related services to Brazos Partners.
Following Brazos Partners, Grayken organized institutional capital to continue investing in distressed assets, closing Brazos Fund, L.P. in 1995 with approximately $250 million of capital commitments.[11]
Lone Star Opportunity Fund, L.P. followed in 1996, with approximately $396 million of capital commitments.[12] At that time Brazos Advisors, LLC was renamed Hudson Advisors LLC.[13]
After an expansion into Canada in 1995 and 1996, Grayken pursued the launch of a global platform for Lone Star in 1997.[14] Since then, Lone Star has invested extensively in North America, Europe and East Asia.[15] Lone Star invested primarily in East Asia, including Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan, following the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.[16] In the mid-2000s, following the establishment of the Eurozone, Lone Star increased its investment focus in Europe.[10] And with the onset of the global financial crisis, from 2007 Lone Star was again actively investing in the U.S.[8]
In July 2015, Lone Star acquired the UK property investment and development company Quintain for £700 million.[17]
In March 2017, the Portuguese Central Bank announced that Lone Star Funds will acquire 75% of third largest Portuguese bank, Novo Banco, in return for a capital injection of €1bn. The other 25% will be retained by the Portuguese bank's resolution fund.
Investment approach[edit]
Lone Star invests in a variety of asset classes, primarily distressed opportunities in developed markets.[18]
Motion picture financing[edit]
Through its credit affiliate, LStar Capital (officially LSC Film Corporation), the company entered the motion picture financing sector when they signed a $200 million deal with Sony Pictures in early 2014. The deal gives them a financial stake in nearly all of Sony's upcoming films.[19] However, due the poor box-office performance of Sony's movies, the two firms severed ties ended on July 17, 2017, two years before the deal was set to end.[20]

The deal gives them a financial stake in nearly all of Sony's upcoming films.[19] However, due the poor box-office performance of Sony's movies, the two firms severed ties ended on July 17, 2017, two years before the deal was set to end.[20]

History[edit]
Lone Star was founded by John Grayken.[8] From 1993 to 1995, Mr. Grayken was Chairman and CEO of Brazos Partners L.P., a joint venture between the Robert M. Bass Group and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,[9] that resolved approximately 1,300 “bad bank” assets resulting from the U.S. savings and loan crisis in the early ‘90s.[10] During this period, Brazos Advisors LLC was formed to provide asset-management and related services to Brazos Partners.
Following Brazos Partners, Grayken organized institutional capital to continue investing in distressed assets, closing Brazos Fund, L.P. in 1995 with approximately $250 million of capital commitments.[11]
Lone Star Opportunity Fund, L.P. followed in 1996, with approximately $396 million of capital commitments.[12] At that time Brazos Advisors, LLC was renamed Hudson Advisors LLC.[13]
After an expansion into Canada in 1995 and 1996, Grayken pursued the launch of a global platform for Lone Star in 1997.[14] Since then, Lone Star has invested extensively in North America, Europe and East Asia.[15] Lone Star invested primarily in East Asia, including Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan, following the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.[16] In the mid-2000s, following the establishment of the Eurozone, Lone Star increased its investment focus in Europe.[10] And with the onset of the global financial crisis, from 2007 Lone Star was again actively investing in the U.S.[8]
In July 2015, Lone Star acquired the UK property investment and development company Quintain for £700 million.[17]
In March 2017, the Portuguese Central Bank announced that Lone Star Funds will acquire 75% of third largest Portuguese bank, Novo Banco, in return for a capital injection of €1bn. The other 25% will be retained by the Portuguese bank's resolution fund.
Investment approach[edit]
Lone Star invests in a variety of asset classes, primarily distressed opportunities in developed markets.[18]
Motion picture financing[edit]
Through its credit affiliate, LStar Capital (officially LSC Film Corporation), the company entered the motion picture financing sector when they signed a $200 million deal with Sony Pictures in early 2014. The deal gives them a financial stake in nearly all of Sony's upcoming films.[19] However, due the poor box-office performance of Sony's movies, the two firms severed ties ended on July 17, 2017, two years before the deal was set to end.[20]
