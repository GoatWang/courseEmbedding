Overview
Provident Financial Group’s primary responsibility is to lend to those who are not well served by mainstream credit products or who would otherwise be excluded from credit altogether. 

Key aspects of this relationship include issues such as carefully checking affordability, lending appropriate amounts, close on-going contact with our customers, and understanding and forbearance if customers experience difficulties.
But there is a Bigger Picture that extends far more widely than our primary responsibility of supplying credit to customers. This Bigger Picture encompasses all the other areas where our business touches the wider society in which we operate and, indeed, the wider world. Such areas include:

The governance, oversight and management of our business
How we treat our staff
How we treat our suppliers
How we treat the local communities in which we operate
How we get involved in wider society
How we treat the environment
How we deal with the tax authorities
How we deal with our regulators.

In dealing with these Bigger Picture issues as attentively as we deal with our primary lending responsibilities, we hope to contribute to creating a more sustainable society for all.
This section addresses how we engage with these Bigger Picture issues in a little more detail.

More about Vanquis Bank





Consumer credit regulation
As a result of holding a bank licence, Vanquis Bank is regulated by the PRA which sets requirements for Vanquis Bank as a solo entity relating to capital adequacy, liquidity and large exposures. Vanquis Bank is also regulated by the FCA for conduct purposes. The FCA regulates the entire financial services industry and uses a set of rules and principals to ensure that customers are fairly treated by providers.

Corporate governance
Provident Financial is committed to high standards of corporate governance and this section provides an overview of how the company has complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012.
Further information is available in the Annual report, which includes the review of Key Governance Principles and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The board
The board comprises the Chairman, two executive directors, sevenindependent non-executive directors and the Company Secretary. Their responsibilities are summarised in the Governance section of the Annual Report (PDF 1.3MB). The names of the directors and the Company Secretary together with their full biographical details, including the skills and experience they each bring to the board, can be found on the Board of Directors page. There is a clear division of responsibility at the head of the group as the Chairman has overall responsibility for the leadership of the board and for its effective functioning, whilst the Chief Executive manages and leads the businesses through their senior management teams.
Board committees
There are five principal board committees: the Executive committee, the Remuneration committee, the Audit committee, the Nomination committee and the Risk Advisory committee. All committees have written terms of reference that define their duties, authorities and membership, and these are reviewed annually.
Performance evaluation
The performance of the board is evaluated annually and the chairman is primarily responsible for this evaluation. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, an external evaluation is carried out every three years. The evaluation includes questions on different aspects of the operation of the board and its committees and the performance of individual directors. The board considers the results of the evaluation and agrees proposals to address any issues identified. The chairman’s performance is also reviewed annually and the senior independent director is responsible for this evaluation.
Internal controls
The board provides oversight to help ensure that the group and its divisions maintain sound internal control and risk management systems. Through the risk advisory committee, it reviews the assessment of risks and the risk management frameworks.
A consistently applied method is used at divisional and group level to identify the key risks that could have a significant impact on the ability of the group to achieve its objectives. Risk owners within the divisions and the corporate office are identified and given responsibility for ensuring actions are implemented with appropriate review dates. The risk registers are reviewed by the risk advisory group and updated at least quarterly. The risk advisory committee is responsible for monitoring the key metrics identified by the divisions and the group in the management of risk and ensures in particular that customer outcomes remain central to the group’s risk management programme.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
