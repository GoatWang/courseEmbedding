Lainie Goldstein is a seasoned psychotherapist, core energetic practitioner and life coach.

Core Energetics is an approach to psychotherapy that works with mind, body and spirit to release emotional blocks and allow individuals to attract levels of creativity, success, abundance and love that was previously beyond their wildest dreams.

Using a variety of mind/body modalities, Lainie blends the best of classic psychotherapy, principles of quantum physics, neuroscience and the attraction of energy to help clients clear resistance and consistently manifest their dreams!

By working with the energy in the body and by helping people challenge distorted beliefs that are not in service of one’s desires, Lainie is extremely successful in assisting individuals to consistently create the life they want.

Lainie holds Master’s Degree from New York University and certifications in both eating disorder therapy and Core Energetics.
