NORWALK, Conn., June 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dialectic Capital Management, LP (together with its affiliates, "Dialectic"), one of the largest shareholders of Covisint Corporation ("Covisint" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:   COVS), with beneficial ownership of approximately 5.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, today announced that it has delivered a letter to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), the full text of which is included below.  Dialectic also announced that it has nominated a slate of five highly qualified candidates for election to the Board at the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.








The full text of the letter to the Board follows:  
June 2, 2016
Covisint Corporation  26533 Evergreen Rd., Suite 500  Southfield, Michigan 48076  Attn: Board of Directors
Dear Members of the Board,
Dialectic Capital Management, LP, together with its affiliates ("Dialectic"), currently owns approximately 5.5% of the outstanding common stock of Covisint Corporation ("Covisint" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders. We initially invested in the Company over a year ago because we were encouraged by the new management team's vision to turn around Covisint, which included a two-part plan to grow the Company.  Unfortunately, by the end of 2015 management not only missed its own targets and timeline for growth but failed to disclose its previously promised "Plan B" for the operating business if the Company missed its 2015 targets ("Plan B"). After numerous delays, management finally stated that it would announce Plan B on the Q1 conference call, which it delayed until June 6, 2016, days after the deadline for nominating director candidates for election to the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders (the "2016 Annual Meeting").
We have serious concerns with Covisint's strategic direction, recent performance and delayed Plan B under the direction of its current management team and Board.  We therefore believe change is needed on the Board to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to implement a clear strategy for the benefit of all Covisint shareholders.  We tried to engage constructively with members of the management team to reach an amicable resolution to reconstitute the Board and avoid a proxy contest but to no avail. To that end, last week we nominated a slate of five highly qualified director candidates for election at the 2016 Annual Meeting, including Scott Daniels, Alan B. Howe, John Fichthorn, John Mutch and Edward Rose.
Management's Failed Strategy
As noted above, we initially invested in the Company in light of the new management team's two-part plan to turnaround the Company, which was clearly laid out to shareholders.  The first part of the plan was focused on growing the Company with a target of $95 million in revenue and a willingness to burn cash down to $34 million, if necessary, by the end of 2015. If that plan was not achieved, management promised shareholders an alternative plan to meet its strategic objectives, which involved a return to profits and the consideration of a potential sale of the Company.
By the end of 2015, despite having $38 million in cash, none of the revenue and profit targets originally outlined by Covisint management had been met. Notably, on the Q4 earnings call, not only did management fail to describe Plan B but it refused to answer our questions or our subsequent calls, apparently only accepting inquiries from sell-side analysts.  When management finally returned our calls two weeks later, we reiterated our desire to understand Plan B and management noted that it would be disclosed on the Q1 earnings call, which was conveniently delayed until June 6, 2016, nine days after the nomination deadline for the 2016 Annual Meeting.  We were therefore left with no choice but to submit a formal nomination of director candidates for election at the 2016 Annual Meeting.  
We believe other shareholders are likewise frustrated with management's inability to communicate a clear strategy for the Company. Both Roumell Asset Management, LLC ("Roumell") and Vector Capital IV, L.P. ("Vector") have filed Schedule 13Ds with respect to their investments in Covisint and have outlined their concerns with the Company's strategic direction. Specifically, Roumell has requested that the Company appoint two independent directors and explore strategic alternatives while Vector has determined that the Board should undertake a strategic review process to sell the Company.
We attempted to engage constructively with the Company on multiple occasions to discuss our concerns regarding management's lack of a strategic plan as well as the concerns and requests publicized by the Company's other large shareholders. We also attempted to reach an amicable resolution with the Company to avoid a proxy contest, which included a proposal that the Company undertake a process to replace two existing Board members with two independent Company-selected directors no later than September 30, 2016. Despite our sincere efforts to reach a resolution, Covisint failed to respond to our proposed settlement until the eleventh hour, just before the nomination deadline for the 2016 Annual Meeting, only to inform us that the Company had rejected our proposed resolution. We believe management purposefully delayed its response to our proposal in an attempt to thwart our lawful nomination, which only solidifies our belief that change is desperately needed on the Board.
Dialectic's Solution
In order to address management's failed strategy and apparent inability to communicate a clear strategy for the Company moving forward, we believe the Board must be reconstituted with directors that will bring a fresh perspective and shareholder-oriented mindset to the Board.  It is time for accountability at Covisint.  
We have therefore nominated five highly qualified director candidates for election at the 2016 Annual Meeting, who we believe have the requisite skill sets and relevant business and financial experience to ensure that the Company evaluates, with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency, all alternative strategies to determine the best path forward to maximize value for all shareholders.  
It is unfortunate – but not surprising given the Company's apparent inability to communicate clearly with its shareholders – that Covisint has chosen to waste additional shareholder resources on a proxy contest rather than work constructively with some of its largest shareholders to implement meaningful change at the Company. 
We are open to continuing our discussions with Covisint regarding Board composition and corporate strategy, and remain amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that is in the best interests of all shareholders. However, if an agreement is not reached, we are fully prepared to solicit the support of our fellow shareholders to elect our highly qualified director candidates at the 2016 Annual Meeting.
Sincerely,


          John Fichthorn          Dialectic Capital Management, LP

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Broadwind Energy (NASDAQ:BWEN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $7.50 (72.02% upside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
