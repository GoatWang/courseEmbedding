Ease of use – placed in ideal location at the base of the LA appendage during routine open heart surgery without adding significantly to length of operation – applied in under five minutes. One piece construction of a surgically approved metal alloy. Atraumatic design without teeth to eliminate bleeding.

			×            





				Cosgrove® Retractor Blades			

Dr. Delos Cosgrove®, III has recently added two new angled, narrow, wire basket blades in addition to the original retractor blades for better surgical exposure.

Unlike the Gillinov/Maze retractor blade, the Cosgrove® angled wire basket blades have a shallower depth for better mitral valve exposure (see side below).


			×

			×

They are 13 inches long and vary in diameter sizes from 9mm to 32mm. 


			×            





				Vasectomy Instruments			

These “no scalpel” Vasectomy instruments are designed to simplify the operation by eliminating the scalpel. The forcep, a sharp point and curved instrument is designed to puncture the scrotal sac, pierce the vas where it is then secure by the Fixation Ring Clamp. Then the vas is clipped and divided. The I.D. of the eyelet is approximately 3.5mm. These instruments are made of high quality stainless steel and secure lock ratchets with no sharp edges.


			×            





				The Bariatric Ring Marker by Schreiber-Kapp			

After gastric bypass surgery, the bypassed stomach remains permanently inaccessible for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The Schreiber-Kapp Bariatric Ring Marker is intended to be used to radiographically (with X-Ray) mark the site of the “gastropexy” performed during gastric bypass surgery, thereby making it accessible for future diagnostic, therapeutic and feeding purposes. 


			×            





				SequeiraTM IMA Retractor

			×            





				Hardy Spinal Retractor			

INDICATIONS: The retractor for transthoracic disc excisions through limited exposure. It also can be used for lumbar laminectomies, and could be adapted for trans-abdominal exposures for cage insertion or other applications. 


			×            





				Strip-T's Sterile Adhesive Surgical Organizer			

Surgical instrument organizer keeps tethered instruments from falling on the floor. Sterile, self-adhesive STRIP-T’S holds and organizes all surgical tubes, scopes and instruments when attached to any location on the surgical field. Economical and easy to use. 


			×            





				Radial Head Implants - Custom			

Approved For Patient Match & Off The Shelf Consignment.
For use of the radial head prosthesis including radial head fractures not amenable to fixation, radiocapitellar arthropathy due to degeneration or malunion of a radial head fracture, complex fracture dislocation of the elbow with loss of radial head support and Essex-Lopresti fracture-dislocation with loss of the radial head, rupture of the interosseous membrane and disruption of the distal radioulnar joint. In these cases, Landsman and Seitz have shown silastic to be inadequate, metallic replacement to be stable and biologic reconstruction to be promising but unproven and with the potential for high degree of complications.  The “off-the-shelf” prosthesis which are available are relatively few and are extremely expensive. What the surgeon finds is that the limited available sizes fit no particular anatomy perfectly. In general one size fits a limited few patients correctly, but will not fit all patients. The question which must be asked is why not provide a custom prosthesis which is easy to insert and provides a degree of stability necessary for these complex injuries.


			×            





				Total Shoulder Instruments			

Kapp Surgical offers a complete line of shoulder instruments. All instruments are custom designed for maximum reliability and strength. They are made of the highest quality stainless steel. 


			×            





				Total Knee Retractors			

INDICATIONS: One set of 5 soft tissue & bone retractors used to expose the Distal Femur & Proximal tibia to allow precise saw cuts. These stainless steel retractors will protect the Posterior Cruciate ligament and the Medial/Lateral ligaments during the total knee implant surgery.


			×            





				Surgical Knee Immobilizer			

This sterile, disposable Knee Immobilizer stabilizes the knee for total knee implant reconstruction. It is disposable and is used to keep the knee stable in both flexion and extension position. 


			×            





				Special Flexor Tendon Clamps			

The fang is used to hold flexor tendons during tendon repair. Some instruments used in flexor tendon repair “crush” the tendon and can lead to stimulation of the scar response and subsequent adhesion formation, while other instruments that transfix the tendon may not adequately immobilize the tendon ends to be sutured, and make for a difficult and potential traumatic repair. The Fang transfixes the tendon close to the cut ends via two needle size teeth directed in an anterior to posterior direction. This is done without crushing the tendon or stimulating the epitenon and allows well controlled passage of suture into the tendon end, a variety of different suture techniques can be utilized. A stop prevents the fang from closing on the tendon and contacting the epitenon and essentially allows for a “touch-less” technique.

				Radial & Ulnar Head Implants			

“The Patient Match implant philosophy has the metal conforming to the bone as opposed to the off-the-shelf implant which has the bone surgically altered to meet the metal. The Seitz Solution Implants are individually designed to fit the patient’s anatomic bone structure.” William H. Seitz, Jr., M.D. – Cleveland Orthopedic and Spine Hospital at Lutheran – Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio

				Modified Javid Clamps			

The Modified Javid Clamps are used to secure various sized shunts (used) during carotid endarterectomy procedures and are manufactured in three sizes with soft rubber inserts. Also, they are designed to close gradually. On the first ratchet the tips remain open approximately 3 to 4 millimeters and close completely on the last ratchet. This new design will prevent damage to the intima of arteries due to the surgeon’s gradual clamping control and rubber inserts.

				Martinez Clamps (Angled Clamp with Cooley Teeth)			

These CVT Surgical Clamps are ideally suited for clamping of arteries located in the depths and superficial vessels of the surgical field. The double angulation of the clamp permits placement of i9ts handle to one side, allowing an unobstructed view of the operative field. the instrument is manufactured in pairs, each being the mirror image of the other, for use on one side or the other, depending on the circumstance. The Martinez Clamp (Angled clamp) is designed to control the internal, external, and common carotid arteries during carotid endarterectomies: for the control of brachial artery during thrombectomy and/or repair following cardiac catheterizaton, and for profunda femoris artery control during femoral artery procedures.

				Loop Aorta CVT-Soft Jaw Aorta Clamp			

We have devised a light, strong clamp for use on the distal ascending aorta. Its advantages are that it may be used with “cushioned jaws” or similar padded inserts, and it conforms to the depth of the superior mediastinum. The clamp lies flat against the neck and does not protrude near the operative field.

				Disjointed Aneurysm Clamps			

This Cleveland Clinic designed disjointed aneurysm clamp is used to clamp the aorta at the neck of the aneurysm Vertically for the Humphries clamp and Horizontally for the Beven clamp. The size used will depend on the size fo the aorta. The Humphries clamp is handed to the surgeon with the lock side in the down position, then the other half of the clamp.

				Bulldog Clamps			

Unlike all other Bulldog Clamps, these clamps give the surgeon complete control of the pressure required as needed. The vast range of pressure (from very weak to very strong) allowed by this Bulldog Clamp can be attributed to its unique design and variable spring. These clamps are manufactured straight 1-3/4” and 2-1/4” long, also 2” long with a right angle 1/4” tip if desired.

				Adult Renal Clamps			

These CVT Surgical Clamps are ideally suited for clamping of arteries located in the depths and superficial vessels of the surgical field. The double angulation of theclamp permits placement of its handel to one side, allowing an unobstructed view of the operative field. The instrument is manufactured in pairs, each being the mirror image of the other, for use to one side or the other, depending upon the circumstance. The large Adult Renal Clamp (Angled Clamp) is designed to control the common iliac artery, the external of internal iliac arteries during surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy of for aorto-iliac occlusive disese. It can also be used for controlling the distal external iliac artery during aorto-bi-drmoral bypass procedures, femoral-popliteal reconstruction, profundaplasties, or femoral embolectromies.
