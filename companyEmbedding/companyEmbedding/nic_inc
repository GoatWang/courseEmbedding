FAQ











Frequently asked questions


How does the weather affect your product?
                    Both the XLP and LP seals are made of Polycarbonate plastic with UV additive. Polycarbonate is ideal for outdoor use as can be seen by its use on meter covers in the industry today.
What is your wire made of?
                    Both the XLP and the LP wires are made from a high grade Stainless steel type 304. This ensures that the wire will not corrode in coastal areas and in areas where chemicals are present.
What makes your product better than the competition?
                    For security tests, all products manufactured by NIC PRODUCTS INC. are tested by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico. In addition our seals were designed with the customer in mind. The seal was designed to facilitate work in the field. The seal has an ergonomic design that makes the seal very easy to use.
Why should I change?
                    The main reasons for change are:
                    • Security
                    • Cost
                    • Ease of use
                    • Versatility
                    • Quality
What Companies do you currently do business with?
                    Some of the current companies that we do business with today are:
                    • Meralco (Philippines)
                    • CFE (Mexico)
                    • USPS (USA)
                    • Pacific Gas and Electric (USA)
                    • Pacific Corp (USA)
                    • An Post (Ireland)
Can the wire that is attached to the seal come in longer length?
                    Yes, In order to use the seal with a longer length wire, NIC supplies the customer with rolls of wire that may be cut to the desired length.
Can the seal have my Company Logo on it?
                    Yes, NIC can place your company logo on the seal. In order to do this NIC would need a JPG, BITMAP, or TIFF file in order to have the logo made.
Up to how many numbers can the seal have?
                    The seal can have up to 7 digits.
How do I install the seal?
                    Please refer to this installation and inspection guide.
How do I know if the seal has been tampered with?
                    Please refer to this installation and inspection guide.
How do I train my employees on how to use the seal?
                    Please refer to the installation instructions.
How am I sure that someone not related to my company wont buy my seals from you?
                    NIC’s policy is that all seals manufactured leave the plant with the end users logo or initials on the seal. All international orders are checked with the end customer and verified with a purchase order.

About us











NIC Products history


Founded in 1994, NIC Products, Inc. is a recognized leader in the security seal industry, producing and marketing a line of seals that combine breakthrough technology with cost-effectiveness and versatility. NIC's seals are used all over the world by leading utilities, government agencies and laboratories. NIC is headquartered in Walnut Creek, California, USA, with a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in the US and a secondary plant in Mexico for assembly and packaging.
History
                NIC Products Inc. was founded in 1994 with the mission to develop the world's best tamper-evident security seals. In 1997, after three years of intensive design, development, and testing, NIC produced the Quickseal XLP. These one-piece wire (or "loop") seals were a break through in security seals due to the quality of the materials, ergonomics, ease-of-use, and the integrity of their indelible identification system.

                NIC's seals were first put to the test by the United States Postal Service (USPS) - a high profile customer with a demanding application: to guarantee the security of its postage meters. A somewhat smaller version of the Quickseal XLP was created, and it was named the Quickseal LP.

                While in use at the USPS, the outstanding performance of the Quickseal LP caught the attention of the United States Department of Defense. Subsequently, Quickseal LP and XLP seals were tested by the Los Alamos National Laboratory Vulnerability Assessment Team (LANLVAT), a world-renowned authority in the assessment of security seals. Besides being judged as the most effective wire seal available, the Quickseal received the highest form of endorsement-the lab began to use the Quickseal for their own applications! Subsequently, many other national labs began to use the Quickseal for their own sensitive materials safeguards programs.

                NIC then turned its focus to providing solutions for revenue protection in the utility industry. The Quickseal LP and Quickseal XLP were enthusiastically adopted as highly effective means of preventing theft and tampering. To date, they have been used in various applications for electric meters, panels, transformers, demand meters, etc., as well as water and gas meters.
Looking Forward
                Today, NIC is expanding is developing products to solve additional problems within the government sector, the utility industry, and additional industries. This year, for example, NIC introduced the Secu-Tape seal, a highly-secure, exceedingly tamper and counterfeit-resistant tape seal. The tape seal is useful for securing devices or equipment to which a wire seal can't be applied.

                In addition, NIC is developing a seal to provide previously unavailable protection for demand meters and a seal that will solve major theft problems in the petroleum industry.

                NIC realizes that effective security does not end with the application of a seal. To achieve the highest level of security, an overall security program is required. A major portion of any successful security program is a system for maintaining the "Chain of Custody" of security devices, i.e., a system that keeps track of who is accountable for a given seal at any given time. Such a system could be very complex and costly to implement, but NIC has the answer - Huru software. Huru software combines a secure but easy-to-use seal tracking system together with the latest technology in bar code scanning and signature authentication to provide a highly effective and economical means of maintaining the Chain of Custody. Increased accountability and ability to pinpoint causes of loss enables drastic reductions in revenue loss.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

WELLNESS


Promoting our employees’ wellbeing is the foundation of our company doing well.

​
BENEFITS
At NIC, the health and happiness of our people aren’t coincidental, they’re essential to us. That’s why we’re proud to cover 100% of group medical premiums for employees and their families, in addition to 100% of group dental, disability and life insurance premiums to all employees beginning one month after joining the company.   DENTAL LIFE DEPENDENT LIFE DISABILITY  
The financial health of our people is equally important to us, so we also offer a generous 401(K) plan, a stock purchase program and educational reimbursement as well.   401(K) INVESTMENT PLAN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM EMPLOYEE EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM 














ACHIEVE IT WELLNESS PROGRAM
Our new Achieve IT Wellness Program is focused on helping employees achieve physical, mental, and financial wellbeing. Employees are engaged through several Achieve IT challenges throughout the year. The more you participate, the higher the rewards! One lucky Grand Prize winner will even win a paid trip for two to anywhere we have an office. Can you say “Aloha”?






 LEADERSHIP SUPPORT It all starts at the top. Setting a good example is vital to
encouraging wellness in the workplace. Our CEO, Harry
Herington, and members of the executive team literally hop on a
plane and visit NIC teams across the country to join them for a
marathon or other wellness initiatives. Execs and employees have
run through mud, climbed over barb wire, jumped over fire, and
even swam through electric shock waters – talk about dedication. 


















ACHIEVE IT AMBASSADORS
Your wellbeing is important to you, which means it's important to us. That is why we have designated wellness ambassadors in each of our 34 offices. Our Achieve IT Ambassadors play an integral role in communicating all wellness initiatives and promoting a culture of wellbeing throughout the office.






 WELLNESS We are passionate about wellness. It is one of the cornerstones of
our healthy organizational culture. Our robust and very rewarding
wellness program offers several wellness challenges throughout
the year and many opportunities to earn exciting awards.
Whether it is a pedometer tracking challenge about a virtual walk
from state capital to state capital, or a challenge encouraging
swapping bad habits for good ones, we make sure our employees
stay engaged, connected, and proud of their achievements.
