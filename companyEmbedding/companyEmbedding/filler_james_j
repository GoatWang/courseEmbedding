Wood Filler Buying Guide





If you are a person that likes to handle DIY projects around the house, you will eventually become acquainted with the need to use wood filler. Wood fillers are commonly usedstuff that can be used for numerous wood repair tasks that you may take on around the house or in your shop. Because there are different projects that will present themselves, there are wood fillers designed to accommodate the distinct needs of various tasks.
There are some wood fillers that have a consistency that is ideal for wide gaps, and then there are those that are more suitable for smaller and more detailed areas. It will be important to have an idea of what the filler will be used for before beginning the search. Following is information and particular tips that will help a user find the wood filler that will be right for their specific project. This can have an immense bearing on the ability of the user to successfully complete specific tasks in which wood filler is needed.
Various Types of Wood Fillers
Generally speaking, you’ll find four types of wood fillers available for consumers to purchase. Each of these wood fillers has unique features that make them ideal for specific uses. Reviewing these types of wood filler and how they are used can help a user determine which wood filler will be best suited for the project that they are working on.
Gypsum-Based Wood Filler
A gypsum-based wood filler is composed of a formula comprised of a mixture of different mineral powders and water, forming a crystalline substance that will not pull away or shrink from the edges of the space that is filled. The use of this type of filler should be restricted to spaces that will be painted after the repair has been completed. This is because this type of filler is almost guaranteed to cause staining. It is also important to note that gypsum-based fillers used on indoor projects one, due to the fact that they aren’t water-resistant.
Cellulose-Based Wood Filler
This type of filler is comprised of a formula that includes a combination of binders and wood fibers. They can be purchased in either, dry-mix, pre-mix or water soluble pre-mixed formulas. Many people prefer the dry mix formula because it has the longest shelf life and it is inexpensive. Another benefit of the dry-mix formula is the fact that the user will be able to use as much as they need at any particular time. The benefit of a pre-mixed wood filler is that it has a shorter dry time. Cellulose-based fillers of good for indoor or outdoor use, as they are waterproof.
Vinyl-BasedWood Filler
The vast majority of vinyl-based filler consist of a polyvinyl acetate or emulsion — which serves as a binder — and calcium carbonate. This results in a very lightweight substance. Vinyl-based fillers are also easy to clean with water. This substance dries very quickly, but its rapid drying formula necessitates the use of thin layer applications. Thick layers could crack once they are dry. This type of wood filler is best for those small repairs around the house, such as plasterboard and wood that will be painted after the repair. Although this type of wood filler does not stain, it could leave white residue.
Epoxies
Epoxies are formulas that come in a two-part compound that is petroleum based. This type of filler works as a wood or adhesive consolidate. When this filler is combined with other materials, a powerful wood filler is formed. The challenge with this type of filler is that it does not tolerate wood stains; however, the user will be able to sand, nail or saw over the material  prior to it drying. This filler also bonds with wood very well, and it is moisture resistant, making it ideal for outdoor use.

Basic Wood Filling Tips
As a general rule, most fillers are very pliable, meaning that the user can use whatever type of tool they are most comfortable with, including cotton swabs, craft sticks, putty knives, or even their fingers. It is important to respect the recommended drying time to prevent damage. Taking the time to remove the excess from the around the edges will create a neat and professional appearance. In order to determine if the wood filler has dried and set, the user can make an indention with their thumbnail. If they are able to get the indention to give in, it means that the filler would need to dry a little longer.
Where to Buy Wood Fillers
Although wood fillers can be purchased in traditional brick and mortar stores, it is not necessarily a good idea. The process of locating the right location can be time consuming, and the prices are usually considerably more expensive than online.
Going through an online retailer will allow the user to conduct a more efficient product search, and the price will be less expensive than going through a brick and mortar store. It is important to conduct some pre-purchase research to make sure you know the type of filler that will work best for your specific situation. Use specific keywords to narrow down the search for the best results.
These guidelines and tips should make the process of finding the wood filler that is right for you much easier.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
