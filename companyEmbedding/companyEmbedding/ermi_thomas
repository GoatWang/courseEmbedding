Products & ServicesEach and every day, Physical Therapists (PT) and other clinicians, use overpressure stretching techniques as a key component for treating patients and improving their ability to move. As a result, patients regain flexibility or range of motion, as well greater strength and balance.
Our unique devices are the only ones that create the overpressure and stretching similar to a PT, leading to greater motion gains with shorter treatment times. (Source:  Uhl & Jacobs. Journal of Arthroplasty, March 2011)
In fact, the difference is that ERMI devices have been shown to more effectively treat range of motion problems when compared to low-intensity devices.
As part of our value added service, ERMI supports patients by verifying insurance benefits and pre-certifying and authorizing coverage while workings with doctors and physical therapists to document medical necessity and to determine if our devices are an appropriate treatment. Once qualified, a trained ERMI representative, delivers the device, makes appropriate adjustments, and educates the patient in a recommended protocol, if the prescribing physician or physical therapist has not provided one already. The ERMI representative then works in partnership with the treating therapist and physician to help the patient.

TREATMENT PROTOCOL: EVIDENCE BASEDWhile all range of motion mechanical therapy devices most likely have a clinically based protocol, many patients find them difficult to use or wear, so compliance is low and the devices are less practical and less effective. ERMI devices are designed with both clinical evidence (i.e. scientifically based results) and the patient’s compliance and use in mind. 
Consequently, ERMI devices are increasingly referred and prescribed by Clinicians for both new patients (who never tried similar products and are often confuse ERMI devices with competitive low intensity devices) and those patients, who failed treatment with seemingly similar devices due to complications associated with disease and/ or low compliance and use.
[Learn More]


THE ERMI DIFFERENCEA recent head to head study comparing ERMI High Intensity in-home mechanical therapy devices with low intensity stretch devices was conducted on Total Knee Arthroplasty patients with decreased Range of Motion. The study contrasted, from baseline to follow up Range of Motion and WOMAC outcome scores. The High Intensity ERMI Knee/Ankle Flexionator resulted in significantly improved Range of Motion and knee related outcome scores from baseline to follow up.
The majority of patients (91%) who utilized the ERMI Knee/Ankle Flexionator  were able to achieve functional range of motion greater than 110 degrees. By comparison, a much smaller group (22%) who used the low intensity device increased their range of motion to that same level.  
[Read More]

Furthermore, these results statistically correlated with increased outcome scores because patients were able unable to perform activities of daily living significantly better. We believe as motion increases, so does a person’s ability to perform activities of daily living without pain. The study used The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). WOMAC is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (score range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0–68). [2]. Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties.[3]
Source: Papotto and Mills Treatment of severe flexion defecits following total knee arthroplasty. A Randomized Clinical Trial. Journal of Orthopaedic Nursing. January/February 2012. 31(1). 29-34




DID YOU KNOW?In a Head to Head Random Control study, 9 out of 10 ERMI knee patients gained their functional motion back, compared to about 2 out of 10 patients getting their functional motion back when using competitive devices / Non ERMI products.
ERMI guarantees results.  The Company stands behind our products 100 percent. If a patient using ERMI products as instructed fails to make motion gains, we will not accept payment for the device.
ERMI is accredited by The Joint Commission. The Joint Commission is the nation’s predominant standards-setting and accrediting body in health care. Since 1951, The Joint Commission has maintained state-of-the-art standards that focus on improving the quality and safety of care provided by health care organizations. Today, The Joint Commission surveys and accredits over 20,000 healthcare institutions.

Can manage, create and modify your work based on your needs.ConsManagement SUCKS, this company is a group of people who treat their enployees as number's. They have favorites and only promote their favorites. They never post position's of higher pay, rather inform the person they want for the job. There a company of "good Ole boys". The few minorities are "white washed". Manager's can't lead, rather direct with no true directional success. Their expectations have zero merit.Advice to ManagementTreat employees like human beings. Not number's. Have a heart, use your role to empower and promote, not degrade, nor devalue. Use your resources, & help your reps as if their success is yours, if they hurt you hurt. People, product, process should be numbet 1. Not promotion to get a company credit card to use for your personal gains.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) ERMI Response seconds agoEdit • Delete ERMI 2016-12-04 21:08 PST Oct 20, 2016 Helpful (1)"sales rep"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales RepresentativeFormer Employee - Sales RepresentativeDoesn't RecommendPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at ERMI full-time (More than 5 years)Prosyoure able to create your own scheduleConsThe device is big and bulky and will definitely scratch you and you're vehicle up transporting it around.
