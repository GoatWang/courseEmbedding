But buying it can be confusing. How much coverage do you need? Should you buy term or whole life insurance? What determines your rate—and how do you know if you’re getting a good quote?We’re here to help you understand, compare and buy the best life insurance for you and your loved ones. First, let’s go over the basics:What is life insurance?Life insurance is a financial protection policy for your family that gives them a tax-free cash payment if you die while the policy is in effect.Term Life InsuranceTerm life gives you coverage for a set period of time—usually while you have dependents relying on your income.Whole Life InsuranceWhole life insurance covers you for your entire life. It’s a more complicated product that, if you live to an old age, eventually gives your family back the money you’ve put in.PolicyGenius recommends term life as the best choice for most shoppers over whole life or other forms of permanent life insurance.Types of Life InsuranceHere is a summary of some of the basic features and differences between the different types of life insurance.Need more info? See our full analysis of term vs. whole life insurance.   -- Table scrolls left to right --    Term Life Return of Premium Term Life Whole Life Universal Life Variable Life Variable Universal Life     Duration 1-30 Years 1-30 Years Life Life Life Life   Guaranteed Death Benefit Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes   Guaranteed Cash Value No No Yes Protected from risk, but can be depleted to pay premiums No No   How Cash Grows (or Shrinks) - - Earns interest at pre-determined rate Variable rate determined by insurer Subaccounts - pool of investor funds offered by insurer Subaccounts - pool of investor funds offered by insurer   Premiums Can increase periodically OR be guaranteed to remain level Can increase periodically OR be guaranteed to remain level Level Varies, up to the customer (subject to federal tax laws) Level Varies, up to the customer (subject to federal tax laws)   Notes No risk of losing coverage, but no cash value when term ends Refunds your premiums at the end of the term if you outlive the policy No risk compared to other permanent types, but there are probably better investment options - Risk of holding expensive insurance policy with little to no cash value Risk of holding expensive insurance policy with little to no cash value       Where do I start?The first step to buying life insurance is calculating how much coverage you need. Our life insurance calculator will help you understand your needs based on your life circumstances and your financial situation.Once you know how much coverage you need, PolicyGenius will compare quotes from the nation’s top carriers and find the best rates available for you. Even better, we’ll guide you through the entire application process until your policy is complete.Ready to calculate your coverage? Let's get startedAverage Cost of Life InsuranceTerm life insurance is one of the most affordable ways to provide financial protection for your family. Many Americans overestimate the cost of life insurance by more than double. In reality, $250,000 of coverage often costs less than most other monthly expenses.*Based on a 30-year old with $60K salary  -- Table scrolls left to right --     Monthly Cost     Eating out$225  Health insurance$180   Phone bill$120   Car insurance$95   Internet$80  Term Life Insurance $30      Best Life Insurance Companies for Term Life InsurancePolicyGenius is fully licensed in all 50 states to work with some of the top-rated life insurance companies, with decades of excellent service and the highest ratings from J.D.

That means we:   Offer all the top life insurance companies so you don't have to shop elsewhere Provide the most accurate online quotes, without requiring any contact info from you Explain what you need to know in plain English so you don't have to research elsewhere Don't sell your info off to life insurance agents as a "lead." Our team is with you from start to finish. Stand by our best price promise. If the insurer approves your application at a different rate than what we quoted, we'll shop your offer around to see if another life insurer can beat it.  All this service at no extra cost to you. Shouldn't I try more than one comparison site?You can, but we've worked hard to offer the easiest life insurance shopping experience you'll find online. We offer the widest selection of A-rated life insurance companies so that you can find the right policy for you.Also, any policy you see on our site won't be any cheaper at another comparison site. That's because each life insurance company files its rates with state regulators, and everyone is required to show those filed rates. And if you see the same policy for a cheaper rate on another site - make sure you're comparing apples to apples. Is it for the same amount and term? Did the other site ask detailed health questions to make sure they can accurately quote you? We do that but not every site does.We stand by our promise - so we make it easy to save your quotes with us (and email them to yourself) to keep shopping. And when you're ready to buy, we hope you'll come back to us. How does PolicyGenius make money?We get paid a commission by the life insurance company when we help you find a life insurance policy, submit an application, and get approved. Commissions are already priced into the cost of life insurance - so you're not paying extra to work with us (or any agent or broker). Our commissions are similar across the life insurers we work with, so we never play favorites. Want to know how much commission we make? Feel free to ask us.Are the life insurance quotes on the PolicyGenius site accurate?We like to say we're in the business of no surprises. Our life insurance quotes are the most accurate available online today. Other sites take your basic information and show you the best health class and price. That's not the right way to quote. We collect more health information upfront to show the most accurate quotes possible (as long as you give us accurate information).If the price on our site is higher than you're seeing elsewhere, for the same policy, that site may not be showing you an accurate quote. Over 80% of policies we sell are within $10 of what we quoted online.If our site can't instantly quote you (which happens when someone has a more complicated health history), one of our licensed advisors can custom quote you.Shouldn't I buy directly from a life insurance company?There's no reason to (and a very big reason not to). First: you don't save any money by buying directly from the life insurance company. By law, the price you get from a given life insurance company is the same through them, or through an agent or broker. Second: the rate you get quoted may not be the rate you're approved at. Life insurance companies do a process called 'undewriting' in which they look at your health history and risk profile to determine whether the rate they quoted is actually accurate. If you apply with the life insurance company directly, and you're approved at a different rate, you're stuck. They won't help you figure out if you can get a better offer elsewhere. If you apply through PolicyGenius, we'll shop that offer around to every life insurance company we work with to see if they can beat it. No extra work for you and no extra cost.

Our term life policies offer some of the most competitive premiums in the industry for a variety of policy periods, coverage levels, and underwriting classes.

                    Whole life insurance can deliver lifetime protection as long as you pay your premiums. If you are concerned with protecting your family from the high costs of settling final expenses, such as funeral expenses, debt settlements, and legal costs, we offer a guaranteed whole life insurance product designed to help meet your needs. Whole life insurance can be an excellent way to protect your family.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
