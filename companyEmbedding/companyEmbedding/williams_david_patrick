A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

Description
Comments (0)



      This is one of a pair of portraits painted by David Patrick (1822-99) of the Williams family; the other painting is of John Williams' wife, Mary holding their baby daughter, Sarah.  David Patrick was brought up in Carmarthen and was in his youth a sailor.  He tried to earn a living as a portrait painter in Carmarthen during the 1850s but by 1861 was listed as a house painter.  No other portraits by this artist have been identified.  Patrick was clearly an untrained artist but this somewhat naive work portrays a vigorous, worthy citizen.  John Williams, a carpenter, was clearly satisfied as he made solid wooden frames for the two portraits.  Oil on panel. Dimensions: 28.5cm x 22.5cm.
