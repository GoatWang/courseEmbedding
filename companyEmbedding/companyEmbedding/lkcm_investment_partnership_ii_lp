The development of investment opportunities for this partnership emanates from the fundamental research process led by our experienced internal research staff.   This team performs rigorous, primary research that seeks to identify small, mid and large capitalization companies as well as private companies that have a true competitive advantage in their industry.  This philosophy provides the basis for our investments in this partnership and is consistent with our firm-wide approach of seeking to build long-term value for our clients.
