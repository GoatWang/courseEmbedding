      recalling 551,090 pounds of chicken products produced at its plant in 
      Hazlehurst, Mississippi.
    

      A sample of the products analyzed by a customer of the Company and the

      the Company has voluntarily recalled approximately 551,090 pounds of

      None of the products that are the subject of this recall were shipped to

      for additional processing into further processed chicken products. The 
      Company has identified all of the products and notified its customers to 
      place the products on hold, return them to the Company and further 
      execute the recall of these products.
    

      The products involved in the recall were produced at the Hazlehurst, 
      Mississippi, plant on September 17 and 18, 2015. The Company is aware of 
      no injuries or adverse reaction caused as a result of consuming this 
      product.
    

      If any customer of the Company or consumers have any questions regarding 
      this recall, they should call the Company at 1-800-844-4030.
    

      Sanderson Farms, Inc. is engaged in the production, processing, 
      marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken and other 
      prepared food items. Its shares trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market 
      under the symbol SAFM.
    

This press release may include forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking 
      statements are based on a number of assumptions about future events and

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

	Sanderson Farms has grown from a small general feed and seed business in 1947 to one of the nation's leading food corporations in fiscal 2016, with sales of more than $2.80 billion. We are currently the third largest poultry producer in the U.S., processing over 3.7 billion pounds of meat in fiscal 2016.

	 

	Our state-of-the-art facilities provide us the capacity to process more than 10.625 million chickens per week. We currently operate 12 poultry plants, with the opening of our newest complex in January 2017 in St. Pauls, North Carolina. This location will provide additional quality products for new customers, opportunities for our employees and, above all, value for our shareholders. Combined with our company-owned feed mills and hatcheries, we are well positioned to keep up with the growing demand for our products.

	 

	Our 13,000+ employees and over 900 independent growers are committed to offering our customers the very best products on the market today. Perhaps that's why the products produced by Sanderson Farms can be found in nearly every state in the country as well as overseas.

	 

	Sanderson Farms was incorporated in Mississippi in 1955 as a fully integrated poultry processing company that produces, processes, markets and distributes fresh and frozen chicken products. Our stock became publicly traded in May 1987 and is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol SAFM.

	 

	Today, the company continues to build upon its rich traditions, believing that our success is largely due to the values instilled by the tenacious efforts of our founders and our extended family of employees. This includes the tradition of providing quality products to our customers and being responsive to their diverse needs, a hallmark of our business for 70 years.
