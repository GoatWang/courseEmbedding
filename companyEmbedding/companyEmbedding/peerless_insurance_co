Welcome to LTC Tree.com, the number one site for Long Term Care Insurance comparisons of all the top blue-chip LTC companies. We provide Long Term Care Insurance quotes, rates, reviews, ratings, company comparisons and other cost information that will help you save money on your Long Term Care Insurance purchasing decision.
We start with the foundational concept that Long Term Care Insurance is like any insurance, you may buy the coverage and never even use it.  Thus, finding that balance between too much insurance and too little is what we help our clients drill down to achieve.

Long Term Care Insurance
Long Term Care Insurance is more than just ordinary retirement planning.  It removes the worry of having to earmark your nest egg for the uncertainty of needing care, so you can enjoy doing the things that make you happy.

Harvard Magazine says that women are living an average of 81.4 years and men are living an average of 76.8 years. Advancements in medicine increase the chance that a person will need long term health care.  More LTC statistics.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that about 51% of people 65 years and older will eventually need these services.
The Wall Street Journal states that a staggering 55% of seniors 85 and older have Alzheimer’s or some other form of dementia, the number one reason for needing assistance.  WSJ also reports that even children are buying policies for their parents to protect their inheritance.

Longevity Increases Need.
Modern health technology is helping the average United States citizen live a longer life.  This extended longevity is increasing the likelihood a person will need Long Term Care services at some point during their life.  In addition to Alzheimer’s and dementia, there are other degenerative diseases such as obesity, diabetes, stroke, heart problems, cancer, Parkinson’s disease as well as accidents and injuries resulting in things like bone fractures which may also create the need for services.  Long Term Care Insurance can help pay for the cost of caring for those conditions so you will have peace of mind knowing you are protected if it were to happen to you.
What Does Long Term Care Insurance Pay For?
Your Long Term Care Insurance benefits can be used to pay for Home Health Care, Assisted Living Facilities, Adult Day Care and Nursing Homes.  In fact, 72% of all LTC claims are paid for Home Health Care. This service is where an aide comes into your home to help with with your Activities of Daily Living and also provide help with cooking and cleaning.  Long Term Care Insurance will help ensure you will be able to stay in your own home to receive care.
The problem: The high cost of needing Long Term Care could drain your life savings.
When planning, consider the high average annual cost of receiving Long Term Care:


Nursing Home – $86,525
Assisted Living Facility – $46,880
Home Care – $42,215



The solution: Plan ahead with Long Term Care Insurance.
The high cost of receiving Long Term Care can erode your nest egg that you have worked so hard to save.  The average stay in a nursing home is now 3.3 years.  That length of time adds up to an average cost of $285,532 per person or $571,065 for a married couple.  That high expense is figured at today’s costs and inflation will likely triple that cost in the next 30 years.  The plan will have inflation protection so your benefits do not lose purchasing power over time.
What if you could protect yourself from the greatest financial risk you will face in your retirement?  Having Long Term Care Insurance coverage can save your nest egg and your retirement.  Imagine how relaxed you’ll feel knowing that you planned ahead and now you and your family are protected.
LTC Tree’s assistance was invaluable in helping us decide which Long Term Care Insurance policy was best for us, while saving us money and providing peace of mind. -Kelly W.   –>More Testimonials

Long Term Care Insurance will help to:
 Maintain your independence.  It allows you receive Home Health Care in the comfort of your own home.
 Protect your Nest Egg (IRA’s, 401K, CD’s, Stocks).  It will help you avoid depleting your investments, losing your home, and then receiving substandard care from a Medicaid-welfare nursing home.
 Avoid being a burden on your family.  Purchasing a plan will prevent you from ever having to ask your kids or family to take care of you.

Peerless Insurance - Peerless is a Poorly run company. Their own workers don't have a clue about their own contracts. My ins Co and I believed that repairing a tiny windsheild crack has NO deductable. Replacing does. 




                                    I bought a used van from a dealer. It was delivered here but not driven (because I was waiting for an electronic key) and I did a full video of it to show any damage- there was none.

I hired the contractor who...

We approached our Insurance agent, and he talked to them, and they agreed to reinstate the Insurance. The next day, they changed...

They have strategically placed people in claims who are disrespectful and insulting. Do not trust Allstate, as you will be in worst hands.

So I got the minimum coverage and still I felt that my rate was too high. I again inquired and was told that once I became age 65, that my rates go up again. But , since my...

            life  insurance,
            home  insurance, and

            for coverage. Learn  more about the value of free insurance quotes today!
        


Many people go online because they're looking for cheap insurance quotes.  Price is definitely a concern, but what you really need to evaluate is the  value you 
                    are getting for that price. There are many companies that will give  you free insurance quotes  online, but what you want is to find a company that will give 
                    you the  bottom line. You need to know what you are getting for that price. Cheap  insurance that offers you no real coverage is not really a value at all.
An effective way to compare insurance  quotes is 
                    to use our site, which offers a type of matchmaking service.  These companies will take your information and match you with companies that will contact you 
                    and help you purchase their products. When you do your  insurance quote comparison you get to talk to a real person. When you buy insurance online in  this 
                    manner it is still more convenient than driving all over town to meet with  insurance agents.
Getting insurance quotes does  not have to be a hassle. 
                    Getting a quote comparison can be done without leaving your home. Time is valuable and many people want to buy insurance online instead of making countless trips to 
                    visit different insurance agents.
When you want cheap insurance, quotes are plentiful.  You must consider what you will be sacrificing when you buy cheap insurance  based on price alone. You could be buying 
                    yourself nothing more than a huge  headache. Problems can range from bad customer service to a lack of coverage  that could cost you hundreds, even thousands, of dollars.
Buying insurance in reality is just taking steps towards  protecting your investments. Whether you are looking to compare online  insurance quotes or you 
                    want instant insurance quotes, remember that the things you are  insuring are some of the biggest investments you make in your life. When you insure your home,  
                    automobile, health and life you are protecting the most valuable things in your  life, thereby ensuring your financial  stability and protecting  your loved ones.
You should not have to chase down the best deal for your insurance needs. You are the customer and the insurance companies should be trying to earn your business. 
                    Being able to discuss your insurance needs with an agent over the telephone combines the service of having a personal agent with the convenience of shopping online.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
