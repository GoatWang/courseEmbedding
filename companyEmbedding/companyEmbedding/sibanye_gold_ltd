P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.87      Net Money Flow ($)  -172,639    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Consensus Ratings for Sibanye Gold Ltd (JSE:SGL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

JOHANNESBURG – Sibanye Gold on Monday announced the appointment of Ken Kluksdahl as chief operating officer for the United States region.
This comes as Sibanye earlier this month appointed Chris Bateman as executive vice-president of the United States region to head and lead the team at the Stillwater Operations.
Kluksdahl, who originally hails from Montana, will play an integral part of the US Regional executive led by Bateman. He has over 30 years’ experience in operational mining roles at a number of global mining companies including Homestake Mining, Rio Tinto and more recently, AngloGold Ashanti.
Kluksdahl served as senior vice-president of projects for AngloGold Ashanti in North America between 2010 and 2011 and then, prior to joining Sibanye, for six years as AngloGold Ashanti senior vice-president for Colombia.
“We welcome Ken to Sibanye’s US Region executive team and look forward to his contribution,” Bateman said.
“Ken brings a wealth of knowledge in strategic operational leadership, project management and continuous improvement and I am confident that he will ensure continued gains in productivity at the Stillwater Operations.”
In May, Sibanye completed the acquisition of Stillwater, the United State’s sole provider of platinum and palladium, for $2.2 billion (about R30 billion), in a bid to create a premier global precious metals miner.

JOHANNESBURG – Sibanye Gold on Monday announced the appointment of Ken Kluksdahl as chief operating officer for the United States region.
This comes as Sibanye earlier this month appointed Chris Bateman as executive vice-president of the United States region to head and lead the team at the Stillwater Operations.
Kluksdahl, who originally hails from Montana, will play an integral part of the US Regional executive led by Bateman. He has over 30 years’ experience in operational mining roles at a number of global mining companies including Homestake Mining, Rio Tinto and more recently, AngloGold Ashanti.
Kluksdahl served as senior vice-president of projects for AngloGold Ashanti in North America between 2010 and 2011 and then, prior to joining Sibanye, for six years as AngloGold Ashanti senior vice-president for Colombia.
“We welcome Ken to Sibanye’s US Region executive team and look forward to his contribution,” Bateman said.
“Ken brings a wealth of knowledge in strategic operational leadership, project management and continuous improvement and I am confident that he will ensure continued gains in productivity at the Stillwater Operations.”
In May, Sibanye completed the acquisition of Stillwater, the United State’s sole provider of platinum and palladium, for $2.2 billion (about R30 billion), in a bid to create a premier global precious metals miner.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Sibanye is a primarily South Africa-focused mining company committed to paying industry-leading dividends. An independent mining group – domiciled in and focused on South Africa – Sibanye currently owns and operates high-quality gold and uranium operations and projects throughout the Witwatersrand Basin. The Group’s corporate office is located close to Westonaria, in the province of Gauteng, near its West Wits operations. In 2016 produced the company around 1.6 Mio. ounces gold and the reserves rose to 31 Mio. ounces gold and 114 Mio. lbs Uranium. The 2015 AISC stood at 1,031 USD/ounce gold with falling tendency to now 895 USD/ounce gold as mentioned in the Q1-2016 report. The operational margin was in 2015 at solid 28%. Sibanye is amongst the Top 10 of the worldwide gold producers, mines in addition Uranium on a by-product basis and starts in 2016 the Platinum production. As a responsible corporate citizen, Sibanye fosters and maintains constructive engagement with all stakeholders in order to deliver on its vision to deliver superior value to all of its stakeholders, to maintain its licence to operate, and ultimately for the long-term success and sustainability of the business. The Group currently owns and operates four underground and surface gold operations in South Africa – the Cooke, Driefontein and Kloof operations in the West Witwatersrand region, and the Beatrix Operation in the southern Free State province. In addition to its mining activities, Sibanye owns and manages significant extraction and processing facilities at its operations where gold-bearing ore is treated and beneficiated to produce gold doré. Sibanye is currently investing in a number of organic projects. Those currently being developed include the Kloof and Driefontein below infrastructure projects on the West Rand and the Burnstone project on the South Rand of Gauteng province. Engineering design is underway on the West Rand Tailings Retreatment Project (WRTRP) and financing options are being considered for this project, which awaits environmental permits before it is submitted to the Board for approval. A dedicated projects team continues to assess and refine plans for projects, including Beisa, Bloemhoek and De Bron Merriespruit in the Free State. In line with Sibanye’s strategy to create value for stakeholders and enhance or sustain its dividend, it entered into two separate transactions to acquire the Rustenburg platinum assets from Anglo American Platinum Limited (Rustenburg Operations) and Aquarius Platinum Limited (Aquarius) in 2015. These transactions are expected to be finalised during the course of 2016. Sibanye mines, extracts and processes gold ore to produce a beneficiated product, doré, which is then further refined at Rand Refinery Proprietary Limited (Rand Refinery) into gold bars with a purity of at least 99.5% in accordance with the Good Delivery standards determined by the London Bullion Market Association. The refined gold is then sold on international markets. Sibanye holds a 33% interest in Rand Refinery, one of the largest global refiners of gold, and the largest in Africa. Rand Refinery markets gold to customers around the world. In addition, Sibanye derives uranium ore as a by-product of gold production from the Cooke operation and keeps it separate from other gold ores by way of a dedicated stream into the uranium section of the Ezulwini gold and uranium plant. The uranium ore is first treated for uranium and then subsequently to recover gold. Production of uranium as a by-product enables Cooke’s gold Mineral Resources to be optimised. Revenue from the sale of uranium is offset against gold production costs, thereby allowing lower-grade gold resources to be mined profitably.     Company Objectives      Sibanye Gold wants to close the two Platinum transactions and start Platinum production as soon as possible with a target above 1 Mio. ounces per annum. Continued and rising dividends for the next years are a major target of the company as well to maintain the high safety standards and good relations to the government and the communities.         Chart      Data & Facts     ISIN:ZAE000173951 WKN:A1KBRZ FRA:0SG JSE:SGL NYSE:SBGL        Outstanding Shares:   2,125,844,078                   Management        Head Office:   Libanon Business Park, 1 Hospital Street         Libanon, Westonaria,1780 - South Africa               Management:   Neal Froneman, CEO         Charl Keyter, CFO         Hartley Digkale, Executive VP Corporate Affairs         Dawie Mostert, Executive VP Commercial Services         Jean Nel, Divisional CEO - Platinum Division         Wayne Robinson, Divisional CEO - Gold & Uranium Division         Richard Stewart, Executive VP - Business Development         Robert van Niekerk, Executive VP - Organisational Effectiveness         John Wallington, Executive VP - Coal and Energy                      News Sibanye Gold Ltd.          1  2   3  ....  7    Next                        Sibanye appoints head of the Southern Africa (“SA”) region      Further to the announcement released on 3 July 2017, Sibanye is pleased to announce that Robert van Niekerk has been appointed as Executive Vice...

Stakeholder engagement - Sibanye Resources

Stakeholder engagement



The outcomes of stakeholder engagement – the concerns of our primary stakeholders – are important determinants of Sibanye’s material issues and hence inform decisions taken to control risk and identify opportunities for the business.
Sibanye is committed to proactive, open and constructive stakeholder engagement, which informs participative decision-making. Our stakeholder engagement aims to:

strategically inculcate a culture of effective engagement within the organisation
develop and implement formal and informal systems of communication for the benefit of the Group and stakeholders
ensure regular engagement and response to issues material to stakeholders
accurately understand the influence of business activities on stakeholders and the potential impact stakeholders may have on the business, whether positive or negative, to enhance the engagement process
ensure engagement is conducted in a timely, accurate and relevant manner
continuously monitor, review and improve engagement activities

As a responsible corporate citizen, Sibanye fosters and maintains constructive engagement with all stakeholders in order to deliver on our vision to create superior value for all stakeholders, to maintain our licence to operate, and ultimately for the long-term success and sustainability of the business.
The Board’s performance and interaction with stakeholders is guided by the South African Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, and management is tasked with the development, and implementation of corporate citizenship policies and programmes for relevant stakeholders.
Sibanye expects employees and communities to appreciate the importance that a profitable and sustainable business holds for them and the other stakeholders who rely on the mining industry.




REFLECTING ON STAKEHOLDERS


INVESTORS AND MARKET ANALYSTS
Excluding Gold One, which represents a consortium of Chinese investors who have acquired a strategic 20% stake in the Group, Sibanye’s investors are primarily geographically diverse institutional investors, located predominantly in the US and South Africa. Engagement is regular and structured with quarterly operational updates, and more detailed six-monthly operational and financial reviews, which enable investors to engage directly with management via live webcast or conference calls. Senior management also undertakes regular global roadshows to interact directly with current and prospective investors. Shareholders expect management to deliver on operational forecasts and the communicated corporate strategy. Adherence to the highest standards of corporate governance are expected. Shareholder investment strategies and tenures differ, making it difficult to target and cater to specific investor groups. A consistent and transparent strategy is crucial to building investor confidence.
Sibanye is widely covered by sell-side analysts who provide investment research and advice to existing and prospective institutional investors. Sell-side analysts tend to do relatively detailed and in-depth analyses of relevant sectors and companies, including peer-group comparisons and benchmarking. Sibanye is comprehensively covered by local and international sell-side analysts from smaller brokers to global, bulge bracket banks. At least nine analysts produce independent research on the Group at any given time.



SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACTORS
Sibanye has categorised its suppliers and contractors into three groups: strategic, tactical and local. Strategic suppliers provide services and products that could have a high impact on Sibanye’s operations, such as reagents and underground support. Without their inputs, production would be seriously hampered. Engagement with them is interactive and contracted to minimise any potential risk to production. Continuous innovation would enhance solutions and drive down costs. A highly interactive partnership ensures that Sibanye’s ability to produce is enhanced.
Tactical suppliers provide Sibanye with the bulk of the day-to-day goods and services required for production. Engagement with these suppliers takes place at an operational level and any issues are managed through the supply chain, which is bound by the Group’s procurement policy. The quality and cost of goods and services are managed through tenders and the ordering process.
Local suppliers are small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) within communities around Sibanye’s operations. Engagement is highly active as the Group needs to develop and grow these suppliers to enable them to support local economic development (LED) and job creation. The skills and experience of local suppliers need to be developed and enhanced to ensure good-quality and sustainable supply of goods and services. These stakeholders expect to play an active and sizeable role in Sibanye’s supply chain.





CHAMBER OF MINES AND INDUSTRY PEERS
Sibanye engages regularly with its peers in the gold, platinum, coal and bulk minerals segments. Collaborative engagement, involving non-competitive issues of common interest, is more prevalent in the gold sector with information and other lessons, particularly sharing health and safety management and community engagement, and collaboration is actively pursued where it can be more effective. The Group also co-operates in strategic industry interventions with potential for synergies. Co-operation is based on agreed mechanisms for and mature rules of engagement. Among gold-mining companies, particularly, co-operation to promote achievement of common goals is strong.
The Chamber of Mines, which plays an important role in expediting peer engagement and in lobbying national government on behalf of the industry, protects the collective interests of mining companies and promotes a positive image of the mining sector as being progressive, transformed and effective, in consultation with other national stakeholders. Chamber membership is voluntary and most major South African mining companies are members.
The Chamber provides a platform, through company representation on collective committee structures, to discuss matters of strategic importance to the mining industry and to provide a mandate to the Chamber. Experts within the Chamber provide leadership in strategic thinking on a broad range of policy domains. Established communication channels are in place to secure strong alignment between the Chamber and its members.


EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISED LABOUR
Sibanye employs 46,269 people with a diverse set of skills, and various educational and cultural backgrounds. They provide services ranging from core mining to processing and support services. Engagement varies, based on the nature of the issue and level of employee. Engagement with management is generally constructive.
Allied to engagement with employees is engagement with organised labour, which includes unions representing certain employee categories, principally those involved in core mining and processing. The unions with whom Sibanye engages are AMCU, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the United Association of South Africa (UASA) and Solidarity. The nature of this engagement is formal. Wage negotiations, conducted collectively for the gold producers under the auspices of the Chamber of Mines, are the most visible subject in union engagement. Inter-union rivalry and its effects are a major concern. Sibanye’s engagement and interaction with the unions is generally respectful and constructive.
Since listing, Sibanye has made significant effort to re-establish direct lines of communication with its employees. Given the close contact and consistent communication, there has been a shift from an adversarial to a more collaborative approach, albeit with some level of scepticism. Sustainable employment, higher wages and benefits are the main tangible employee expectations. However, they also expect a relationship based on values. Union relationships tend to be more complex with a clear political influence affecting relations. The quality of the relationship with employees is evident in greater participation in Group programmes, feedback and the degree of workplace disruptions.





COMMUNITY AND CONSULTATIVE FORUMS
Communities in the vicinity of and affected by Sibanye’s operations, together with those in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) labour-sending areas, are an important stakeholder grouping. Engagement is undertaken with formal and informal representatives through community and consultative forums as well as civic groups, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and other special-interest groups. These forums, which are often multi-stakeholder in nature, comprise local community leaders and representatives as well as local government officials. They address issues of mutual concern, such as employment and LED, especially business development and access to supply chain opportunities. The forums have introduced greater degrees of transparency and openness between Sibanye and communities. Ongoing, structured engagement facilitates positive dialogue to identify and address the negative impacts of mining on communities. The chief focus is to identify, discuss and resolve issues affecting communities.

Sibanye engages with all levels of government and various government departments but principally with office bearers based in the Gauteng and Free State, as well as (following the Burnstone acquisition) the Mpumalanga regional offices of the DMR regarding safety and mining rights. Other departments with which Sibanye engages include environmental affairs, water and sanitation, labour, health and education, among others.
Engagement with the national offices is on an as-and-when-needed basis. Engagement is ongoing and generally robust yet constructive. Inconsistencies in the application of regulatory requirements and individuals’ preferences can be problematic, and engagement at local level is frequently included in the community and consultative forums in which local government is represented.
Other regulators with whom Sibanye engages are the National Nuclear Regulator and National Energy Regulator of South Africa as well as the JSE, the NYSE and US SEC regarding its stock-exchange listings.
