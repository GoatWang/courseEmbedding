Varex: An Overlooked Spin-Off With 25% Upside - Varex Imaging Corporation (NASDAQ:VREX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Varex: An Overlooked Spin-Off With 25% UpsideJun. 6.17 | About: Varex Imaging (VREX) Tom Yuz Special situations, Deep Value, event-driven, contrarianSummaryVarian’s spin-off Varex is trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple that is a fourth of the industry average despite its market leading position in medical and industrial markets.The recent acquisition of PerkinElmer's medical imaging segment offers overlooked opportunities for product cross-selling and manufacturing scale, enabling a potential 30% share price appreciation.Enhancement in Varex's international operations will fuel greater margin expansion and top-line revenue growth, even as markets remain fixated on domestic production.Varex Imaging Corporation (NASDAQ: VREX) - Current Price: $34.95 | EBITDA: 121.4M | MV: 1.32B BUY with Target Price Appreciation: Bear: --2.37%, Base: 25.30%, Bull: 32.0 Investment Thesis & Recommendation Varian's spin-off Varex has hit the ground running, growing into a leading producer in the world's $26 billion dollar diagnostic imaging market. The multi-layered complexity of digital detector and X-ray tube products has stimulated inefficiencies in market pricing of VREX's assets (EV/EBITDA multiple trading at a fourth of the industry average), while the recent acquisition of PerkinElmer's medical imaging business offers overlooked opportunities for product cross-selling and manufacturing scale. With a price target of $42.09, Varex presents an appealing 25.30% upside even without assuming complete utilization of potential synergies with PerkinElmer's medical imaging segment. Company Overview Varex is an international designer and manufacturer of cost-effective diagnostic imaging solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in medical (82% of sales) and industrial (18% of sales) segments. 1) The Medical Imaging segment manufactures over 100,000 X-ray tubes for four primary medical diagnostic radiology applications: computed tomography ("CT") scanners, radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging, special procedures, and mammography. OEM customers incorporate VREX products into their medical diagnostic, radiation therapy, dental, and veterinary imaging systems. 2) The Industrial business segment designs, manufactures, sells and services X-ray accelerators, imaging processing software, and image detection products for use in security and industrial inspection applications, such as cargo screening and nondestructive examination in a variety of applications. For instance, OEM customers sell the systems with VREX components to customs and other government agencies for use in ports and borders to screen overland, rail, and sea cargo for contraband, weapons, narcotics and explosives, as well as for manifest verification. Varex also sells its Industrial products to commercial enterprises in the casting, power, aerospace, chemical, petro-chemical and automotive industries for nondestructive product examination purposes, such as industrial inspection and manufacturing quality control.
 

 Industry Overview 1) Medical Imaging: The most immediate market for VREX's technologies is a $3 billion dollar X-Ray radiography market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3% to 2020. In the medical imaging market, flat panel detectors are experiencing rapid growth, driven by a market transition from analog to digital systems due to X-ray dose reductions, lower production costs, increased patient throughput, and U.S.-legislated reimbursement cuts for analog systems. As product cycles shorten, there will be significant replacement opportunity for the 500,000-plus analog units that exist globally. With a fragmented competitive landscape and many OEMs lacking scale, the industry continues to outsource flat panel detector manufacturing to specialists such as VREX while offering substantial potential for consolidation. Moreover, the need for accurate imaging is capable of addressing modalities from magnetic resonance imaging, to medical sonography, to nuclear medicine functional imaging: combining these segments of biological imaging taps into a cumulative $34.43 billion medical imaging market (6% CAGR). Each sophisticated imaging approach sends signals into the body to spatially map out organs. Although these other types of imaging do not require X-ray tubing, they utilize VREX products such as digital detectors (45% of VREX revenues) and connectors + processing workstations (10% of revenues). 2) Industrial and Security Imaging: As disruptive technologies such as 3D printing achieve greater adoption and automation continues to redefine the industrial landscape, in-process inspections using imaging and detection software continue to experience growing demand. The addressable industrial market, currently at $850 million, is expected to more than double to $2 billion dollars by 2025 for a CAGR of 10%. Furthermore, with airport screening and baggage security at the forefront of the public consciousness, security imaging is expected to also grow to $2.5 billion by 2020 in the United States alone. The capital-intensity of manufacturing imaging components will provide sustainable moats to leading manufacturers such as VREX and prevent competitive entry going forward.
 

 Mispricing & Value Drivers 1) The market is discounting the cross-selling capabilities of Varex's acquisition of PerkinElmer's medical imaging business. On May 1st, 2017, Varex completed the acquisition of PerkinElmer's imaging business for $276 million. The move consolidates two of the three major independent producers in the high-end dynamic detector market. PerkinElmer is head-quartered in Waltham, Mass., with multiple operations across Europe, and specializes in producing high-resolution, digital flat panel CMOS detectors. Currently, PerkinElmer is already projected to add $140 million in annual sales (~51% of purchase price) with end-markets in medical, industrial, and dental imaging. However, VREX's new product portfolio, which blends offerings of x-ray tubes, linear accelerators, and now CMOS-based digital detectors, can achieve rapid margin expansion and top-line revenue growth through successful PerkinElmer-VREX package offerings. For example, if a VREX X-ray tube is sold with each digital detector bought by newly acquired detector customers, sales would rise by an additional $30 (~11% of purchase price) million in annual revenues. With combined production volumes also increasing manufacturing scale and improving direct material costs, PerkinElmer's imaging business serves as a bulwark against margin deterioration and offers return above its purchase price within two years (even without extensive cross selling). 2) Deeper understanding of VREX's product mix reveals robust opportunities for gross margin improvements protected by long-term economic moats and product scale. X-Ray Tubes: Radiographic X-rays use a small amount of radiation that passes through the body to quickly create a 2D image of a patient's anatomy to assess injury or disease. Computed tomography (CT) combines the power of multiple 2D X-rays with computers to produce 3D, cross-sectional views of the body; the system delivers up to two times improvement in volumetric resolution, detecting smaller lesions in tissues that differ in physical density by 1%. The competitive dynamics of the X-ray tube market are split between higher end CT tubes and lower-end radiographic tubes. Radiographic tubes, which are cheap and easy to manufacture, have experienced a highly competitive market with multiple producers. On the other hand, upper-tier CT imaging components are defined by amplified levels of technological complexity, intellectual property, and engineering that result in higher sales prices and gross margins. Due to manufacturing complexity, there are no independent manufacturers of CT tubes other than Varex, with production limited to OEM's with in-house production capabilities (such as GE, Siemens, Phillips, Toshiba). During the second quarter of 2017, VREX accepted and shipped an order for a package of components for several hundred general radiographic systems. Consequently, the quarter's unfavorable shift to lower-margin components dropped gross margin 2.3% to 37.2%.
 However, management has recognized the competitive merits of pursuing higher-end product markets, and a significant portion of revenues going forward will come from the sale of high-end X-ray Tubes used in CT imaging. For instance, VREX recently renewed a 3-year pricing agreement with Toshiba Medical Systems for $345 million dollars' worth of CT Tubes. A separate one-year pricing agreement to supply digital detectors and high-voltage connectors (worth ~$25 million) will further boost revenues while securing higher margins in the future. Of the Top 3 CT Scanners per Providian Medical (GE's BrightSpeed Elite, Philip's Brilliance 16, and Siemens SOMATOM Sensation 10), VREX produces a partner CT tube product for all of them. Even more so, nearly 80% of tubes revenues comes from replacement tubes. CT tubes not only produce the highest product margins, but are also replaced more frequently (every 2-3 years) than radiographic tubes (3-5 years). Based on previous analysis of Varian's medical imaging patent portfolio, VREX owns approximately 220 patents issued in the United States and 108 patents issued throughout the rest of the world and had 129 patent applications on file. By targeting upper-level X-ray tube segments and locking in patent protection, VREX stands to secure long-term organic revenue growth and sustained margin expansion. Digital Detectors: The second largest chunk of VREX revenues stems from digital detectors, which are also broken down into the lower-end radiographic detectors and the higher-end dynamic detectors. When watching a movie, dynamic detectors can be likened to a five-minute scene while radiographic detectors are single shots. While the highly-competitive market for radiographic detectors has been experiencing price erosion since initial product introductions 10 years ago, dynamic detectors are only beginning to blossom. For U.S users, reimbursements for studies digitized with a radiographic readers will be cut starting in 2018, fueling further adoption of higher-margin digital detectors. Management already produced 22% more detectors in the quarter than one year ago. Continued demand for higher-margin digital detectors will be driven by the growth of the global dental imaging market (7% CAGR) and the growth of mobile C-arm systems for surgical applications (less than 20% of mobile C-arms manufactured by OEMs are shipped as digital systems). As the cost difference between analog image intensifiers and digital detectors continues to diminish, digital detectors will grow to dominate the market in coming years.
 3) The market is preoccupied with VREX's domestic operations, even as key opportunities for expansion lay in emerging markets. VREX's second quarter revenue break-down saw only 33% of revenues stem from sales in the Americas ($51.2 million), while EMEA ($46.9 million) and APAC ($56.7 million) comprised 30% and 37% of sales respectively. While revenues in the Americas and EMEA saw contraction of 6.2% and 0.2% respectively, APAC experienced a notable 17.6% rise in sales (pulling total revenues up 3.3%). Americas revenues declined primarily due to lower sales of x-ray sources and digital detectors. Meanwhile, APAC revenues rose due to higher sales of X-ray tubes, digital detectors, and high voltage connectors, partially due to a large tender-based order shipped during the quarter. In the Q2 2017 earnings call, management noted that, "We're working on a number of new CT tubes and high-voltage connectors for Chinese OEMs who have CT imaging systems in various stages of development and market introduction." It is precisely such distinctions between market development of American and Asian provinces that leads to sharper insight into VREX's future growth trajectory. While management believes that approximately 50% of X-ray imaging systems in the U.S. have already converted to full digital, the world-wide conversion rate toward digital is only at 33%. By 2020, medical imaging is expected to convert from 67% analog to 56% analog, while industrial imaging is expected to convert from 75% analog to 65% analog. Of the 20 new OEM's in China serving as system aggregators (compiling components into a full CT System), VREX has already established 12 new partnerships. As Chinese markets are focused on advanced cardiac CT applications and new CT tubes for mammography, VREX's expansion in international operations will yield incrementally higher margins than domestic operations while delivering more room for future growth (mediating the 2% margin deterioration recently seen in the medical imaging segment).
 

 Valuation & Assumptions 

 VREX is currently trading at a severe discount to industry peers (DXCM, GMED, ALOG, CMD, ABMD), with an EV/EBITDA of 11.68 compared to an industry median of 18.2. Given the above-mentioned opportunities for modest margin expansion as the gradual integration of the PerkinElmer assets into company operations, the base case undershoots management revenue-growth expectations by 4%, assumes a 2021 EV/EBITDA substantially below the current industry median, and targets 25.3% appreciation. 

 

 Given the above sensitivity analysis, multiple expansion toward the industry median serves as a robust confirmation of the discounted cash flow analysis summarized above. Catalysts v Third Quarter Reporting of sales combining synergies from the PerkinElmer deal would demonstrate enhancement of revenues from the new product portfolio and increase market awareness of VREX's new top-line revenue composition.
 v Future Purchase Orders from APAC Clients would induce greater media attention around VREX's growing dominance in Asia. Key Risks & Mitigants v International Customers: More than half of VREX's revenues are generated from customers outside of the United States. Strengthening of the dollar will raise external sourcing costs, increasing customer petitions for discounts, causing delayed purchasing decisions, or increasing reliance on in-house manufacturing. Mitigant: VREX's accretive acquisitions have improved scale and increased cost competitiveness, while complexity of production in higher-end products precludes competitive entry in production. v Separation Agreement: Per the Separation and Distribution Agreement, VREX will transfer all cash and cash equivalents in excess of $5 million to Varian for 2017. Mitigant: The excess cash payments to complete the transfer is approximately $45.1 million, which will be amply covered by cash currently held on balance sheet of $79.6 million.

About Us









 



Varex Imaging Corporation
Varex Imaging Corporation is the world’s largest independent supplier of medical X-ray tubes and image processing solutions. From medical imaging, to cargo screening and border security, our components are used by X-ray imaging system manufacturers everywhere to detect, diagnose, and protect.
Our products are designed to harness the power of X-ray energy to pioneer advances in any application. This requires us to maintain an extensive catalog, and we are a leading supplier of high-voltage connectors, X-ray collimators, ionization chambers, mammography paddles, solid state automatic exposure control systems and buckies for digital imaging.
As a leader in imaging components, our goal is to help our customers become world-class system suppliers by strengthening their competitiveness, and enabling them to bring products to market faster. Our rich history spans 50+ years of dedication to the imaging industry, but our everyday work is devoted to our partners’ success.






History
Despite its young age, Varex Imaging Corporation has a rich history of experience that dates back to the 1930’s, when Jack McCullough and Bill Eitel created Eimac Products. Eimac quickly became known for producing high-quality, high-power transmitter tubes, and relocated its manufacturing operations to Utah, after receiving a large military contract in 1941.
Foreseeing the end of the war, Eimac Products began to expand its expertise to include new tube types, such as television cathode ray tubes (CRT) and microwave tubes for radar applications. Eventually, Eimac would merge with Varian in 1965.
As Varian grew to a global household name in X-ray imaging, it became apparent that a “spin-off” company would be needed to operate and hold its ever-expanding imaging components business. For this purpose, Varian Medical Systems created Varex Imaging Corporation on January 1, 2017. Together, the two companies are able to concentrate their efforts on the unique needs of each business, and pursue distinct opportunities for long-term growth and profitability in the imaging industry.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

This renewed agreement will be effective April 1, 2017.Potential sales of CT tubes associated with this renewed agreement are estimated to be in the range of $345 million to $385 million. Orders under this renewed agreement will be booked when placed over the three-year term. CT tube pricing and expected volume ranges under this renewed agreement are consistent with CT tube purchases made in the past two years under the prior pricing agreement. Innovation and product performance also factor into the supply agreement with Toshiba Medical, with some tube pricing incorporating price adjustments based on extending CT tube performance.In addition to this renewed pricing agreement, Varex has in place separate one-year pricing agreements to supply to Toshiba Medical other imaging components, including digital detectors and high voltage connectors. Annual sales of these additional components have ranged from $20 million to $30 million per year."The continuation of our four-decades long relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems is a testament to its strength and Toshiba Medical's confidence in our ongoing ability to develop new X-ray imaging component technology that improves performance, contributes to faster time to market and reduces cost as Toshiba Medical introduces a number of next-generation imaging systems over the coming years," said Sunny Sanyal, Chief Executive Officer of Varex Imaging Corporation.

Varex Imaging Announces Financial Results For The Second Quarter Of Fiscal Year 2017HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)LISTENWho is the face of pro baseball?Yahoo Finance's Dan Roberts and Myles Udland debate the business of baseballVarex Imaging Announces Financial Results For The Second Quarter Of Fiscal Year 2017PR NewswireMay 4, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSALT LAKE CITY, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Varex Imaging Corporation (VREX) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. These are its first financial results since becoming a new public company following the spin-off from Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) on January 28, 2017. Comparable financial statements for fiscal year 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 reflect operating results for the Imaging Components business of Varian prior to its separation and include estimates of cost allocations for various corporate functions, interest expense and tax expense.Varex Imaging CorporationMoreQuarterly HighlightsRevenues increased 3% to $155 millionGross profit margin was 37%Operating profit margin was 15%Net earnings increased to $15.0 million, or $0.40 per diluted shareSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 ResultsRevenues rose by 3% to $155 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 from $150 million in the prior year quarter due to solid sales increases in X-ray sources, connect and control components and software that was partially offset by a decline in digital detectors. Net earnings for the second quarter were $15.0 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $14.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the same quarter a year ago.The company-wide gross margin declined to 37% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 from 39% in the year-ago quarter due to higher costs of quality and a shift in product mix to lower margin radiographic components, which were partially offset by increased sales of higher margin X-ray sources for security applications. During the quarter, the company accepted and shipped an order for a package of components for several hundred general radiographic systems consisting of X-ray tubes, digital detectors and high voltage connectors. While this package increased Varex's revenues, it created an unfavorable mix shift to lower margin components, which was a contributing factor in reducing the gross margin rate. The operating margin was 15% in the second quarter versus 17% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the lower gross margin. Higher R&D investment was largely offset by lower SG&A expenses."I am pleased to report top-line growth of 3% for the current quarter and 5% year to date. Since the slowdown in our revenues in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, all of our product lines have experienced good recovery and the trailing 12 month revenue growth rate was 7%," said Sunny Sanyal, Chief Executive Officer of Varex Imaging Corporation. "I am also encouraged to see lower SG&A costs in the second quarter. This was a 27% sequential improvement from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, which included allocations from Varian and separation costs. We have successfully completed the separation from Varian and are well prepared to operate as a stand-alone company."Medical segment revenues increased 3% to $126 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 from $122 million in the year-ago quarter due to higher sales of digital detectors and software. The Medical segment gross margin rate was 35% in the second quarter compared to 38% in the same quarter a year earlier. This decline was due to higher costs of quality, and to a lesser extent, a shift in product mix to lower margin radiographic components.Industrial segment revenues increased 6% to $29 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 from $27 million in the year-ago quarter primarily due to higher sales of X-ray sources to security customers that were partially offset by lower digital detector sales to industrial customers. The Industrial segment gross margin rate was 45% in the second quarter compared to 46% in the same quarter a year earlier.Read MoreSanyal added, "During the quarter we also extended our multi-decade long relationship with our largest customer, Toshiba Medical Systems, with a renewed three-year pricing agreement for our CT X-ray tubes. This is a vote of confidence in our ongoing ability to develop new X-ray imaging component technologies that improve performance and reduce time to market as Toshiba Medical introduces several of their next-generation imaging systems over the coming years."At the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $80 million. During the quarter, the company established a $300 million credit facility, borrowed $200 million and paid this amount to Varian in connection with the separation. At the end of the second quarter, the company's debt was $202 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, Varex replaced its prior credit facility with a larger $600 million credit facility made up of a $400 million five-year term loan plus a $200 million revolving line of credit. The company used $497 million of this new credit facility to repay existing debt and fund the acquisition of the PerkinElmer medical imaging business and credit facility fees.Year-To-Date Fiscal Year 2017 ResultsFor the first six months of fiscal year 2017, revenues increased 5% to $312 million from $297 million in the prior year period. Net earnings were $26 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $29 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period. The gross margin was 37% in the first six months of fiscal year 2017 versus 39% in the prior year period. The operating margin was 13% in the first six months versus 16% in the comparable year-ago period, primarily due to allocations from Varian and separation costs that were incurred prior to the company's separation from Varian, as well as lower gross margins.Acquisition of PerkinElmer's Medical Imaging BusinessOn May 1, 2017, Varex completed the purchase of the PerkinElmer's medical imaging business. This digital detector business is expected to add approximately $140 million in annual sales with margins similar to Varex. The audited financials for this acquisition will be filed with the SEC by mid-July 2017. During the next 12 to 18 months, this business will be integrated into Varex's Medical and Industrial segments, with a transition services agreement with PerkinElmer supporting this integration. This acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive on a cash basis.Varex OutlookAs a reminder, the company previously stated that Varex will provide guidance on an annual basis. Also, as Varex just closed the acquisition of PerkinElmer's medical imaging business earlier this week, at this time the company is only able to include the added revenues in its guidance. Varex expects to update its full year revenue and EPS guidance to include this acquisition when the company reports its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.For fiscal year 2017, Varex maintains its previous expectation that organic revenues will grow by 3% to 4% over fiscal year 2016. The added revenues from the acquisition are expected to increase Varex's revenue growth by an additional 9% to 10% over fiscal year 2016.The incremental increase in interest expense resulting from the higher debt level of Varex's new credit facility is expected to reduce net earnings in the fiscal year by approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Including this impact, the company's net earnings for the second half of fiscal year 2017 are expected to be in a range of $0.69 to $0.79 per diluted share, which does not include financial results from the acquisition.In order to provide enhanced transparency to Varex's ongoing operations that adjust for the impact of its acquisition of PerkinElmer's medical imaging business, the company intends to provide certain non-GAAP financial measures starting with the reporting of its financial results for the third quarter of 2017.Conference Call InformationVarex is scheduled to conduct its second quarter fiscal year 2017 conference call at 3:00 p.m. MT today. This call will be webcast live and can be accessed at Varex's website at investors.vareximaging.com, then clicking on the link for this quarterly earnings call.
