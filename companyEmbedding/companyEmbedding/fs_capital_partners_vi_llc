1The public offering price of FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to an upfront sales load of up to 4.25%. Shares of FSIC IV’s Class T common stock are also subject to an annual distribution fee of 1.00% of the estimated value of the shares as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The public offering price is subject to change. FSIC IV’s total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common stock was 7.74% for the period from January 6, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC IV’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully.
        

2The net investment amount for shares of FSIC IV’s Class T common stock is the public offering price, net of the maximum upfront sales load of 4.25%.
        

3The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share of Class T common stock (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share of Class T common stock as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by the public offering price per share of Class T common stock as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate and amount shown are net of the 1.00% annual distribution fee and may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC IV’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 30% of FSIC IV’s distributions were funded through net investment income (prior to expense reimbursement) and 70% of FSIC IV’s distributions were funded through short-term capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, on a tax basis. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC IV’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC IV’s fiscal year and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC IV’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually of Form 1099-DIV.

1Stockholder returns (without sales charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at the public offering price for FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock, excluding any selling commissions, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC IV’s distribution reinvestment plan (DRP). Valuation as of the end of each period is the repurchase price pursuant to FSIC IV’s share repurchase program on such date. Stockholder returns (without sales charge) are net of a 1.00% annual distribution fee and do not include selling commissions, which, effective as of January 25, 2017, could total up to 4.25% of the public offering price per share of Class T common stock. Had such selling commissions been included, the performance shown would be lower.
              

2The stockholder return (with sales charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC IV’s public offering price per share of Class T common stock, including the then applicable maximum selling commissions (up to 2.20%), at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC IV’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period assumes such investor tendered all shares of Class T common stock pursuant to FSIC IV’s share repurchase program at the repurchase price on such date.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017, and are net of the 1.00% annual distribution fee. The payment of future distributions on FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC IV’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions

      View risk factors disclosure




Investing in FSIC IV may be considered speculative and involves a high level of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC IV’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in the section of FSIC IV’s prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC IV’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC IV’s common stock and FSIC IV is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before FSIC IV completes a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than you paid for them. While FSIC IV intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for FSIC IV’s shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC IV may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a discount to the current offering price on the date of repurchase.FSIC IV intends to invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid.FSIC IV’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to FSIC IV for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses.An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC IV’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC IV’s investments may adversely affect FSIC IV’s business.FSIC IV is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on FSIC IV’s investments.FSIC IV has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of FSIC IV’s investments and may increase the risks of investing in FSIC IV’s securities.FSIC IV has limited operating history and is subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.If FSIC IV is unable to raise substantial funds in its ongoing, continuous “best efforts” public offering, then FSIC IV will be more limited in the number and type of investments it may make.FSIC IV’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees that are subject to repayment to FSIC IV’s affiliate, FS Investments, and FSIC IV’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of these distributions may not be based on FSIC IV’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments were not to reimburse certain of FSIC IV’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of any amount owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled.Please see FSIC IV’s prospectus for a more complete list of risks associated with investing in syndicated loans.







To invest in FSIC IV, an investor must have either (i) a net worth (not including home, furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth (not including home, furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $250,000. Some states impose heightened suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. 
Shares of FSIC IV are currently not available for investment by residents of New Jersey. This webpage is not approved for use in Massachusetts.
An investment in FSIC IV’s common stock involves significant costs and investors should review the information in FSIC IV’s prospectus regarding fees and expenses.

	FSIC Overview



FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies.  Investment approach  We seek to invest primarily in the senior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, the subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns for our investors. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive or purchase equity interests such as common and preferred stock, warrants or options.  FSIC is differentiated by our flexible investment strategy which allows us to invest across the corporate capital structure and provide diversified exposure across multiple industries. Our core investment strategy is focused on direct originations and opportunistic investments, such as event-driven investments and anchor orders, which we believe allow us to take advantage of market inefficiencies. In certain circumstances we may also opportunistically invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Managers  FSIC is advised by FB Income Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of FS Investments, a leading manager of debt-focused alternative investment funds, and sub-advised by GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of Blackstone. With approximately $93 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017, GSO Capital Partners is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers with approximately 345 employees in New York, London, Dublin and Houston. We seek to leverage our size and resources with GSO’s global brand, underwriting capabilities, network of relationships and origination platform to maximize returns and preserve capital.  Since FSIC’s inception in January 2009, it has grown to become one of the largest BDCs in the market. As of March 31, 2017, FSIC had approximately $4.3 billion in assets under management and investments in 108 portfolio companies across 16 industries.  FS Investments is the largest sponsor of BDC assets with approximately $18.3 billion in BDC assets under management as of March 31, 2017.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)
