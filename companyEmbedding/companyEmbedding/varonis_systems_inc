Varonis Systems is an American software company with headquarters in New York City with R&D offices in Herzliya, Israel. They developed a security software platform to let organizations track, visualize, analyze and protect their unstructured data. Varonis performs User Behavior Analytics (UBA) to identify abnormal behavior and defend enterprise data from cyberattacks.[2] Their software extracts metadata from an enterprise’s IT infrastructure and uses this information to map relationships among employees, data objects, content, and usage - giving organizations more visibility into their data, and protecting their critical and sensitive information.[3]

History[edit]
Varonis Systems was founded in 2005 by Yaki Faitelson and Ohad Korkus, in order to address security issues such as file activity tracking, information rights management, and access control.[4][5] Prior to Varonis, Mr. Faitelson and Mr. Korkus held leadership positions in the global professional services and systems integration divisions of NetVision and NetApp.[6]
In 2003, a number of critical files - expensive, high res images of the ocean floor - disappeared suddenly from the file servers where they were stored. The energy company that had spent millions of dollars to create those images wanted to know who deleted the files, and who had access to the folders holding the files. Storage experts Faitelson and Korkus quickly realized that there were no existing systems able to answer these questions, and founded Varonis in order to create a better way to protect, track, analyze, and visualize data.[7][8]
Faitelson and Korkus invented a solution that would retrieve metadata contained in file systems. They brought in Dr. Jacob Goldberger, an expert in statistical modeling and machine learning, to help develop the algorithms that would provide the user-data link.[9] In 2005, Faitelson, Goldberger, and Korkus filed a patent, “Automatic management of storage access control, which was granted in 2006.[10] The result of their work was the Intelligent Data Use (IDU) classification platform, a platform for gathering and analyzing file data use. The first product based on this platform, DatAdvantage, was released in 2006 - built so that enterprises can monitor file activity and user behavior, and manage data ownership, data access rights, and responsibilities of file system data.[11][12]
Varonis continued with core platform development. In 2009, Varonis added the IDU Classification Framework, which allowed Varonis products to search for keywords, phrases and patterns from file content.[13] In 2013, Varonis released DatAlert to detect and uncover insider threats and potential data breaches, notifying and alerting on suspicious file system activity including unusual access to sensitive data and changes to permissions and configuration files.[14]
Varonis raised capital from Accel Partners, Evergreen Venture Partners, Gitano Venture Capital, and EMC. On February 28, 2014 an initial public offering of Varonis stock raised about $106 million.[15][16]
Technology and Architecture[edit]
The Varonis Metadata Framework is implemented at two levels. Non-intrusive monitoring resides on file servers, feeding both real-time file event information and ACLs to a separate server.[17] The collected data is stored in a database. The second part, the IDU analytics engine, performs statistical analysis to derive data owners, baseline user activity, and user groupings. The Metadata Framework is able to incrementally index file metadata, thereby allowing it to efficiently maintain the current state of file metadata in its database. DatAdvantage presents this information to IT administrators. As of April 30, 2016, Varonis had 28 issued patents in the United States and 43 pending U.S. patent applications.[18]

Varonis Systems is an American software company with headquarters in New York City with R&D offices in Herzliya, Israel. They developed a security software platform to let organizations track, visualize, analyze and protect their unstructured data. Varonis performs User Behavior Analytics (UBA) to identify abnormal behavior and defend enterprise data from cyberattacks.[2] Their software extracts metadata from an enterprise’s IT infrastructure and uses this information to map relationships among employees, data objects, content, and usage - giving organizations more visibility into their data, and protecting their critical and sensitive information.[3]

History[edit]
Varonis Systems was founded in 2005 by Yaki Faitelson and Ohad Korkus, in order to address security issues such as file activity tracking, information rights management, and access control.[4][5] Prior to Varonis, Mr. Faitelson and Mr. Korkus held leadership positions in the global professional services and systems integration divisions of NetVision and NetApp.[6]
In 2003, a number of critical files - expensive, high res images of the ocean floor - disappeared suddenly from the file servers where they were stored. The energy company that had spent millions of dollars to create those images wanted to know who deleted the files, and who had access to the folders holding the files. Storage experts Faitelson and Korkus quickly realized that there were no existing systems able to answer these questions, and founded Varonis in order to create a better way to protect, track, analyze, and visualize data.[7][8]
Faitelson and Korkus invented a solution that would retrieve metadata contained in file systems. They brought in Dr. Jacob Goldberger, an expert in statistical modeling and machine learning, to help develop the algorithms that would provide the user-data link.[9] In 2005, Faitelson, Goldberger, and Korkus filed a patent, “Automatic management of storage access control, which was granted in 2006.[10] The result of their work was the Intelligent Data Use (IDU) classification platform, a platform for gathering and analyzing file data use. The first product based on this platform, DatAdvantage, was released in 2006 - built so that enterprises can monitor file activity and user behavior, and manage data ownership, data access rights, and responsibilities of file system data.[11][12]
Varonis continued with core platform development. In 2009, Varonis added the IDU Classification Framework, which allowed Varonis products to search for keywords, phrases and patterns from file content.[13] In 2013, Varonis released DatAlert to detect and uncover insider threats and potential data breaches, notifying and alerting on suspicious file system activity including unusual access to sensitive data and changes to permissions and configuration files.[14]
Varonis raised capital from Accel Partners, Evergreen Venture Partners, Gitano Venture Capital, and EMC. On February 28, 2014 an initial public offering of Varonis stock raised about $106 million.[15][16]
Technology and Architecture[edit]
The Varonis Metadata Framework is implemented at two levels. Non-intrusive monitoring resides on file servers, feeding both real-time file event information and ACLs to a separate server.[17] The collected data is stored in a database. The second part, the IDU analytics engine, performs statistical analysis to derive data owners, baseline user activity, and user groupings. The Metadata Framework is able to incrementally index file metadata, thereby allowing it to efficiently maintain the current state of file metadata in its database. DatAdvantage presents this information to IT administrators. As of April 30, 2016, Varonis had 28 issued patents in the United States and 43 pending U.S. patent applications.[18]

					Full Description



Varonis Systems, Inc. (Varonis), incorporated on November 3, 2004, provides a solutions that protect data from insider threats and cyberattacks. The Company's products include DatAdvantage, DataPrivilege, Interface Data Unit (IDU) Classification Framework, Data Transport Engine, DatAnywhere and DatAnswers. The Company's platform allows enterprises to analyze, secure, manage and migrate volumes of unstructured data. It specializes in file and e-mail systems that store valuable spreadsheets, word processing documents, presentations, audio and video files, e-mails and text. Its Metadata Framework is a technology platform that extracts metadata from an enterprise's information technology (IT) infrastructure. Data often contains an enterprise's financial information, product plans, strategic initiatives, intellectual property, and confidential employee, customer or patient records. IT and business personnel deploy its software for a range of use cases, including data security, governance and compliance, user behavior analytics, archiving, search, and file synchronization and sharing. The Company's subsidiaries include Varonis Systems Ltd. (VSL), Varonis UK (VSUK), Varonis Systems (Deutschland) GmbH (VSG), Varonis France SAS (VSF) and Varonis Systems Corp. (VSC).DatAdvantageDatAdvantage is built on the Company's Metadata Framework, and captures, aggregates, normalizes and analyzes every data access event for every user on Windows and UNIX/Linux servers, storage devices, e-mail systems and intranet servers, without requiring native operating system auditing functionalities or impacting performance or storage on file systems. Through a graphical interface, DatAdvantage presents insights from human-generated data using normal computing infrastructure. It is also the Company's presentation layer for IT departments, which provides a map of user, group and data objects, and usage and content, facilitating analysis from multiple vectors.DataPrivilegeDataPrivilege is designed for use by business unit personnel. DataPrivilege provides a self-service Web portal that allows users to request access to data necessary for their business functions and owners to grant access without IT intervention. DataPrivilege also enables IT and business users to make access decisions based on queries, user requests and metadata analytics information. DataPrivilege provides a presentation layer for business users to review accessibility and usage of their data assets, and grant and revoke access.Interface Data Unit Classification FrameworkThe IDU Classification Framework identifies and tags data based on criteria set in multiple metadata dimensions, and provides business and IT personnel with actionable intelligence of this data, including a prioritized list of folders and files containing sensitive data and those with inadequate permissions. For the identified folders and files, it also identifies users having access to that data, using it, owning it, and recommending ways to limit access without disrupting workflow. The IDU Classification Framework provides visibility into the content of data across file systems and intranets sites, and combines it with other metadata, including usage and accessibility.Data Transport EngineThe Data Transport Engine software provides an execution engine that unifies the manipulation of data and metadata, translating business decisions and instructions into technical commands, such as data migration or archiving. Data Transport Engine allows both IT and business personnel to streamline activities for data management and retention from day-to-day maintenance to platform and domain migrations and archiving. Data Transport Engine ensures that data migrations automatically synchronize source and destination data with copying even if the source data is still being used; translates access permissions across platforms and domains, and provides reporting capabilities for data migration status. It also enables IT personnel to schedule recurring migrations to automatically find and move certain types of data, such as sensitive or stale data, and to perform migrations, dispositions and archiving.DatAnywhereDatAnywhere allows users to collaborate with other users that use the common Internet file system shares through mapped drives or universal naming convention paths. DatAnywhere ensures that the shared data remains on firm file servers and retains the approved access permissions without any need for data to be moved from existing file shares or migrated to a repository. DatAnywhere also integrates with the existing backup policies, cache devices, distributed file system, replication, and existing data governance and compliance technologies, processes and policies.DatAnswersDatAnswers provides search functionality for enterprise data. Capitalizing on the Metadata Framework infrastructure and its analysis of data access events, file system and directory services metadata, DatAnswers indexes files as they are created and changed without requiring continual scanning; filters out results users should not see based on the recommendations engine in DatAdvantage and classification results found by the IDU Classification Framework, and ranks results using analysis of data usage. DatAnswers is used for end-user search and e-discovery projects.The Company competes with Veritas Technologies LLC and Francisco Partners and Elliot Management.

DATADVANTAGE
Take your data security to the next level
Monitor file activity and user behavior, prevent data breaches, and make permissions management and auditing a breeze.
Request a Demo





 











Take control of your data
We don’t just show you where sensitive data lives, we show you where it’s overexposed, who is accessing it, and how to lock it down. DatAdvantage will also identify stale data that is no longer accessed by actual humans – save disk space, lower cost and simplify your environment all at once. 
DatAdvantage uses machine learning and bi-directional cluster analysis to pinpoint users that have access to files they don’t need to do their job. It’s your single interface for managing permissions and security groups. 




Get a Free Data Risk Assessment
95% of our customers said the free risk assessment helped them build a plan of attack to reduce the likelihood of a data breach. Read more…












One platform to rule them all
Full visibility and control over your unstructured data, wherever it lives.

Exchange

DatAdvantage for
UNIX/Linux













Secure your data from the inside out
Varonis performs User Behavior Analytics (UBA) to secure your data from the inside-out, using machine learning to find patterns and anomalous behavior to stop breaches before they happen.
Our sophisticated threat models analyze behavior across multiple platforms and alert you to suspicious activity and potential data breaches. From CryptoLocker infections to compromised service accounts to disgruntled employees, we’ll detect and alert you on all sorts of abnormal user behavior.




Request a Demo












Monitor and analyze every single file touch
Monitoring with DatAdvantage is non-intrusive and doesn’t require native auditing – making it easier than ever to perform security investigations, prove compliance, and find lost files.
Automatically detect and correct changes that don’t meet your organization’s change management policies. Satisfy many of the requirements prescribed by SOX, HIPAA, PCI, GLB, FERC/NERC, and more.












“DatAdvantage has enabled us to remove the risks associated with data permission changes within our IT environment. As an organization, we can prove to our regulators that our IT controls are stringent and that we are providing effective protection around our data.”
-Colin Lennox, Technical Services Manager, Baillie Gifford




Who uses DatAdvantage?












DatAdvantage for Windows ensures that only the right people have access to the right data at all times, all access is monitored, and abuse is flagged.

Common Questions





What hardware/software do I need?

A Windows Server 2008 or newer (can be virtual) with 80GB disk, 8GB RAM, and 2.3 GHz CPU or better
SQL Server 2005 or newer
A basic domain user for crawling AD
A domain user with local admin on the install server (usually the same account as above)






Do you need to run as domain admin?
Nope. We’ll need admin credentials to install, but our services do not need to run as domain admin once they’re there. 
In fact, we really prefer they don’t. To monitor Windows servers, for example, we need a domain user with backup operator and power user rights. In UNIX, we run as a normal user.





Is there any performance impact on my production servers?
We typically measure between a 1% and 2% increase in CPU utilization for NAS devices. Our windows agent/filter usually takes between 0-1% CPU, 6-10 MB of RAM, and we never write to disk on the system we’re monitoring. For Windows, SharePoint and UNIX/Linux environments, the Varonis agent is co-installed with a ‘watchdog’ service that ensures it never exceeds defined boundaries of CPU and memory utilization.





Do you require agents to get audit events?
It depends on the platform we’re monitoring:

Windows = agent
SharePoint = agent
UNIX/Linux = agent
Exchange = agent
Active Directory = no agent
Office 365 = no agent
NAS = no agent on most platforms






Ew, agents?
We all wish every platform had good built-in auditing, but many don’t. So we’ve been writing file-system filters (agents) since 2005, tackling Windows, Solaris, Linux, AIX, SharePoint and Exchange. Varonis filters/agents have been battle-tested with thousands of customers. Our Windows filter, for example, usually takes between 0-1% CPU, 6-10 MB of RAM, and we never write to disk on the system we’re monitoring.
No agents required to get permissions, users & groups, or classify data





What’s a free risk assessment?

We’ll build a personalized risk report that showcases your security wins and vulnerabilities
We outline your problem areas – wondering about global access? Exposed sensitive data? Stale data? We got this. We’ll prioritize risk, and give you concrete steps to take to improve your data security
We’ll help you fix real production security issues
While we’re running, we’ll even enable automatic detection for things like ransomware, privilege escalations, misconfigurations, and odd user behaviors







Take control of your enterprise data



All Varonis products are free to try and come with complimentary concierge onboarding and installation.

Detect security gaps and insider threats. Analyze behavior across multiple platforms and trigger alerts on suspicious activity and potential data breaches.
Enforce a least privilege model. Get full visibility on domain and local admins and identify accounts with unnecessary privileges.

“Varonis works across the whole organization. It works with our infrastructure, our Active Directory, it works on all the hardware and software we have. It’s allowed us to see what goes on – and see what’s out there. We were able to detect and disable a ransomware infection within 10 minutes of an attack.”
– Wade Sendall, Vice President of IT, Boston Globe

About Us

	We provide an innovative software platform that allows enterprises to manage, analyze and secure enterprise data. We specialize in creating software that manages and protects enterprise data against insider threats, data breaches and cyberattacks by detecting and alerting on deviations from known behavioral baselines, identifying and mitigating exposures of sensitive data and automating processes to secure enterprise data. Enterprise data under our scope is typically comprised of sensitive information that is stored in spreadsheets, emails, word processing documents, presentations, audio files, video files, text messages and any other data created by employees. This data often contains an enterprises financial information, product plans, strategic initiatives, intellectual property and numerous other forms of vital information. Our Metadata Framework is a proprietary technology platform that extracts critical metadata, or data about data, from an enterprises IT infrastructure and uses this contextual information to map functional relationships among employees, data objects, content and usage. IT and business personnel deploy our software for a variety of use cases, including data governance, security, management, archiving and information collaboration.

Reflecting those trends, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rose a so-so 1.21% in June, leaving them with a 2.66% advance for Q2 and a 7.68% gain year to date,

Varonis Systems is an American software company with headquarters in New York City with R&D offices in Herzliya, Israel. They developed a security software platform to let organizations track, visualize, analyze and protect their unstructured data. Varonis performs User Behavior Analytics (UBA) to identify abnormal behavior and defend enterprise data from cyberattacks.[2] Their software extracts metadata from an enterprise’s IT infrastructure and uses this information to map relationships among employees, data objects, content, and usage - giving organizations more visibility into their data, and protecting their critical and sensitive information.[3]

History[edit]
Varonis Systems was founded in 2005 by Yaki Faitelson and Ohad Korkus, in order to address security issues such as file activity tracking, information rights management, and access control.[4][5] Prior to Varonis, Mr. Faitelson and Mr. Korkus held leadership positions in the global professional services and systems integration divisions of NetVision and NetApp.[6]
In 2003, a number of critical files - expensive, high res images of the ocean floor - disappeared suddenly from the file servers where they were stored. The energy company that had spent millions of dollars to create those images wanted to know who deleted the files, and who had access to the folders holding the files. Storage experts Faitelson and Korkus quickly realized that there were no existing systems able to answer these questions, and founded Varonis in order to create a better way to protect, track, analyze, and visualize data.[7][8]
Faitelson and Korkus invented a solution that would retrieve metadata contained in file systems. They brought in Dr. Jacob Goldberger, an expert in statistical modeling and machine learning, to help develop the algorithms that would provide the user-data link.[9] In 2005, Faitelson, Goldberger, and Korkus filed a patent, “Automatic management of storage access control, which was granted in 2006.[10] The result of their work was the Intelligent Data Use (IDU) classification platform, a platform for gathering and analyzing file data use. The first product based on this platform, DatAdvantage, was released in 2006 - built so that enterprises can monitor file activity and user behavior, and manage data ownership, data access rights, and responsibilities of file system data.[11][12]
Varonis continued with core platform development. In 2009, Varonis added the IDU Classification Framework, which allowed Varonis products to search for keywords, phrases and patterns from file content.[13] In 2013, Varonis released DatAlert to detect and uncover insider threats and potential data breaches, notifying and alerting on suspicious file system activity including unusual access to sensitive data and changes to permissions and configuration files.[14]
Varonis raised capital from Accel Partners, Evergreen Venture Partners, Gitano Venture Capital, and EMC. On February 28, 2014 an initial public offering of Varonis stock raised about $106 million.[15][16]
Technology and Architecture[edit]
The Varonis Metadata Framework is implemented at two levels. Non-intrusive monitoring resides on file servers, feeding both real-time file event information and ACLs to a separate server.[17] The collected data is stored in a database. The second part, the IDU analytics engine, performs statistical analysis to derive data owners, baseline user activity, and user groupings. The Metadata Framework is able to incrementally index file metadata, thereby allowing it to efficiently maintain the current state of file metadata in its database. DatAdvantage presents this information to IT administrators. As of April 30, 2016, Varonis had 28 issued patents in the United States and 43 pending U.S. patent applications.[18]

Varonis Systems was founded in 2005 by Yaki Faitelson and Ohad Korkus, in order to address security issues such as file activity tracking, information rights management, and access control.[4][5] Prior to Varonis, Mr. Faitelson and Mr. Korkus held leadership positions in the global professional services and systems integration divisions of NetVision and NetApp.[6]
In 2003, a number of critical files - expensive, high res images of the ocean floor - disappeared suddenly from the file servers where they were stored. The energy company that had spent millions of dollars to create those images wanted to know who deleted the files, and who had access to the folders holding the files. Storage experts Faitelson and Korkus quickly realized that there were no existing systems able to answer these questions, and founded Varonis in order to create a better way to protect, track, analyze, and visualize data.[7][8]
Faitelson and Korkus invented a solution that would retrieve metadata contained in file systems. They brought in Dr. Jacob Goldberger, an expert in statistical modeling and machine learning, to help develop the algorithms that would provide the user-data link.[9] In 2005, Faitelson, Goldberger, and Korkus filed a patent, “Automatic management of storage access control, which was granted in 2006.[10] The result of their work was the Intelligent Data Use (IDU) classification platform, a platform for gathering and analyzing file data use. The first product based on this platform, DatAdvantage, was released in 2006 - built so that enterprises can monitor file activity and user behavior, and manage data ownership, data access rights, and responsibilities of file system data.[11][12]
Varonis continued with core platform development. In 2009, Varonis added the IDU Classification Framework, which allowed Varonis products to search for keywords, phrases and patterns from file content.[13] In 2013, Varonis released DatAlert to detect and uncover insider threats and potential data breaches, notifying and alerting on suspicious file system activity including unusual access to sensitive data and changes to permissions and configuration files.[14]
Varonis raised capital from Accel Partners, Evergreen Venture Partners, Gitano Venture Capital, and EMC. On February 28, 2014 an initial public offering of Varonis stock raised about $106 million.[15][16]
Technology and Architecture[edit]
The Varonis Metadata Framework is implemented at two levels. Non-intrusive monitoring resides on file servers, feeding both real-time file event information and ACLs to a separate server.[17] The collected data is stored in a database. The second part, the IDU analytics engine, performs statistical analysis to derive data owners, baseline user activity, and user groupings. The Metadata Framework is able to incrementally index file metadata, thereby allowing it to efficiently maintain the current state of file metadata in its database. DatAdvantage presents this information to IT administrators. As of April 30, 2016, Varonis had 28 issued patents in the United States and 43 pending U.S. patent applications.[18]

Opening A Case



How do I open a case?
Open a case through the portal, via email or using our support line (see numbers at the top of the page).
For more information about the portal or opening a case via email, refer to the How To Open a New Case with Support via Web Browser and How To Open a New Case with Support via email articles.



What kind of information is helpful to provide when opening a case?
Will you request to upgrade?
If so, please follow instructions in the Connect KB article named What to Check When Planning to Upgrade the Varonis IDU Suite.
Do you have a ‘how do I do….’ type of question or a technical issue?
Depending on the nature of your issue, the following details could be useful for the support team to better understand and help resolve your issue:



General Information – details like the software version, the architecture and any related environmental information.
Scenario

For a technical issue: In case the issue occurs after some action is performed, describe the scenario as best as you can.
For an ‘how do I…’ question: Describe what you are attempting to accomplish.


Screenshots (if applicable) – Compliment the Scenario description with screenshots (before / after, error messages, screen the question is relevant to), it helps tremendously to understand the scenario, and bridges the gap of mismatching terminology.
Logs – Windows event logs, SQL logs, specific product logs (for example: DP, DN), network traffic captures and any other piece of data that relate to the issue.
Business Impact – description of the limitations that the issue presents to business users.






When opening a case, what does the severity level mean?
When opening a case through the portal, you are asked to select the severity level. The support team will use the severity level and other supporting information in your case to assign a priority to your case. Listed below are the severity levels that you can choose from.
Severity levels:

Severity 1 – A down situation where core components of the software are non-operational and there is no known work-around.
Severity 2 – A major component of the software is not functioning and no work-around is available, but the software still supports core functionality.
Severity 3 – A minor component of the software is not functioning and any other case where a software feature is not operating as documented.

If you believe that the support team has not prioritized your case correctly, you can let the support team know by responding to your case (via email or through the portal) and provide more details about your situation.



Can the support team help me create reports?
The support team can help answer general How-To questions about the reports and help utilizing additional resources to make the most of your Varonis experience.
However, if you need a consultation or you would like to work through multiple concerns with an individual Varonis contact, Varonis recommends that you contact your local sales team or register for our complimentary Office Hours service.





After Submitting A Case



What happens after I submit a case?
After you submit a case, the support team will perform a detailed review of your case, determine the appropriate severity level, and send you a response. The initial response you will receive may include one of the following: a solution to your issue, a request for more information or a request to schedule a remote session.



What can I do if my case needs more attention?
If circumstances around your case change and you believe it needs more attention from the support team, you can respond to the email that you have received from the support team or go to your case in the portal and request an update.
When requesting an update, include details, such as new factors, concerns about a deadline, etc.



What happens if I report a bug?
If you report a bug and the support team has been able to fully reproduce it, the engineering team will investigate the feasibility of a fix. Based on the severity of the problem the engineering team will deliver a patch or integrate a solution into a future maintenance release.

Why we’re here
In 2003 a large oil and gas company nearly had a disaster. They spent millions of dollars capturing hi-resolution images of the ocean floor and stored them on their file servers. One day these images were gone.
Were they accidentally deleted? Deliberately stolen? Two storage experts discovered that there was no record of what had happened, and no easy way to figure it out.
From this potential disaster, these storage experts saw opportunity. File systems were growing exponentially in complexity and size. Data was becoming more valuable than ever, and it needed to be better protected.
And so in 2005, those storage experts – Yaki Faitelson and Ohad Korkus – founded Varonis to give organizations more visibility into their data, and to protect their critical information.







One-of-a-kind technology
Our platform collects, stores and analyzes metadata non-intrusively, in real-time, on the major platforms that store unstructured data. It was architected from the ground up by a team of technologists with deep domain expertise and the hunger to tackle massive problems.

In what language is Support available?

Opening A Case



How do I open a case?
Open a case through the portal, via email or using our support line (see numbers at the top of the page).
For more information about the portal or opening a case via email, refer to the How To Open a New Case with Support via Web Browser and How To Open a New Case with Support via email articles.



What kind of information is helpful to provide when opening a case?
Will you request to upgrade?
If so, please follow instructions in the Connect KB article named What to Check When Planning to Upgrade the Varonis IDU Suite.
Do you have a ‘how do I do….’ type of question or a technical issue?
Depending on the nature of your issue, the following details could be useful for the support team to better understand and help resolve your issue:



General Information – details like the software version, the architecture and any related environmental information.
Scenario

For a technical issue: In case the issue occurs after some action is performed, describe the scenario as best as you can.
For an ‘how do I…’ question: Describe what you are attempting to accomplish.


Screenshots (if applicable) – Compliment the Scenario description with screenshots (before / after, error messages, screen the question is relevant to), it helps tremendously to understand the scenario, and bridges the gap of mismatching terminology.
Logs – Windows event logs, SQL logs, specific product logs (for example: DP, DN), network traffic captures and any other piece of data that relate to the issue.
Business Impact – description of the limitations that the issue presents to business users.






When opening a case, what does the severity level mean?
When opening a case through the portal, you are asked to select the severity level. The support team will use the severity level and other supporting information in your case to assign a priority to your case. Listed below are the severity levels that you can choose from.
Severity levels:

Severity 1 – A down situation where core components of the software are non-operational and there is no known work-around.
Severity 2 – A major component of the software is not functioning and no work-around is available, but the software still supports core functionality.
Severity 3 – A minor component of the software is not functioning and any other case where a software feature is not operating as documented.

If you believe that the support team has not prioritized your case correctly, you can let the support team know by responding to your case (via email or through the portal) and provide more details about your situation.



Can the support team help me create reports?
The support team can help answer general How-To questions about the reports and help utilizing additional resources to make the most of your Varonis experience.
However, if you need a consultation or you would like to work through multiple concerns with an individual Varonis contact, Varonis recommends that you contact your local sales team or register for our complimentary Office Hours service.





After Submitting A Case



What happens after I submit a case?
After you submit a case, the support team will perform a detailed review of your case, determine the appropriate severity level, and send you a response. The initial response you will receive may include one of the following: a solution to your issue, a request for more information or a request to schedule a remote session.



What can I do if my case needs more attention?
If circumstances around your case change and you believe it needs more attention from the support team, you can respond to the email that you have received from the support team or go to your case in the portal and request an update.
When requesting an update, include details, such as new factors, concerns about a deadline, etc.



What happens if I report a bug?
If you report a bug and the support team has been able to fully reproduce it, the engineering team will investigate the feasibility of a fix. Based on the severity of the problem the engineering team will deliver a patch or integrate a solution into a future maintenance release.
