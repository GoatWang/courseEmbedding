ERP Operating Limited Partnership Key Developments

ERP Operating Limited Partnership Enters into New $2.0 Billion Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement
Nov 3 16
On November 3, 2016, ERP Operating Limited Partnership entered into a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced the operating partnerships then existing revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature on April 2, 2018. Equity Residential (“EQR”), the sole general partner of the operating partnership, remains a guarantor of the Operating Partnership’s obligations under the new credit facility. The new credit facility is with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Co-Syndication Agents, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and a syndicate of other banks. The new credit facility matures on January 10, 2022. The Operating Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $750 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. The interest rate on the advances under the new credit facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread, which is dependent on the current credit rating of the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt and is currently 82.5 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, which is based on the credit rating of the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt, and is currently 12.5 basis points.


Equity Residential Announces Early Results of Cash Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations for Certain Outstanding Debt Securities
Jan 29 16
Equity Residential announced the early tender results of the previously announced tender offers and solicitations of consents by its operating partnership subsidiary, ERP Operating Limited Partnership to purchase for cash certain debt securities listed in the tables below. The offer is being made solely pursuant to and is subject to the terms and conditions in the Operating Partnership’s offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement, dated January 14, 2016, and a related Consent and Letter of Transmittal. The Operating Partnership’s Consent Solicitations sought consents from holders of the 5.125% Notes due 2016 and the 5.375% Notes due 2016 to amend the indenture governing the 2016 Notes to alter the notice requirements for optional with respect to each such series of Securities. Adoption of the Proposed Amendments required the consent of a majority of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of each series of the 2016 Notes to be effective with respect to such series. As of the Early Tender Date, the Operating Partnership had received the Requisite Consents from holders of the 5.375% Notes. As a result, the company intends to enter into a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, to be effective as of the Early Settlement Date, effecting the Proposed Amendments with respect to the 5.375% Notes only, which will be binding on all remaining holders of the 5.375% Notes, and issue a notice of redemption to call for redemption all of the 5.375% Notes that remain outstanding following the Early Settlement Date. In the event the Requisite Consents are received from holders of the 5.125% Notes following the Early Settlement Date, but on or prior to the Expiration Date, the company reserves the right to enter into a Supplemental Indenture effecting the Proposed Amendments with respect to the 5.125% Notes, which would be binding on all remaining holders of the 5.125% Notes, and issue a notice of redemption to call for redemption of all of the 5.125% Notes that remain outstanding. The Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on February 11, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Operating Partnership.

Customer Success Stories







What others are saying about MISys Manufacturing Software



Texas manufacturer realizes 50% reduction in inventory levels, improved production management and stronger gross profit margin by using MISys Manufacturing Software.“Everything connected to inventory.” There was no inventory management system in place at the company. The values and quantities of inventory were not remotely accurate, no item numbers existed, purchasing used multiple spreadsheets to determine if there was enough inventory on hand for production schedule, inventory costs were not accurate and not up to date, unable to price jobs accurately because of lack of true costing of the inventory. Sage 50 did not have the functionality needed. The cost of processing Purchase Orders (departmental expense allocated to purchasing activities/number of POs issued) was really high.Read Case Study



SOLIDWORKS Integration with MISys Manufacturing "Overall it works great. I can import an entire folder of items in a matter of minutes, a task that would have taken me much longer to do without the new import feature. The time savings alone make this a great new improvement. However, it also allows me to easily check that all of the revisions are correct, that the formatting is the same for all the items being imported, and that I have correctly titled the items, which eliminates quite a few data entry errors (which seem to get easier to make the more data you have to enter). I am very much impressed with the new feature."Watch Demo Video

Sage 50 did not have the functionality needed. The cost of processing Purchase Orders (departmental expense allocated to purchasing activities/number of POs issued) was really high.Read Case Study



SOLIDWORKS Integration with MISys Manufacturing "Overall it works great. I can import an entire folder of items in a matter of minutes, a task that would have taken me much longer to do without the new import feature. The time savings alone make this a great new improvement. However, it also allows me to easily check that all of the revisions are correct, that the formatting is the same for all the items being imported, and that I have correctly titled the items, which eliminates quite a few data entry errors (which seem to get easier to make the more data you have to enter). I am very much impressed with the new feature."Watch Demo Video
