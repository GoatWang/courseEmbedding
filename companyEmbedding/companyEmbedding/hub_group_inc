Intermodal

We Are Tens of Thousands of Containers Full of Reliability
We are over 45 years of time-tested solutions. We are also home to nearly 2,700 drivers and many full-time intermodal professionals, whose collective industry experience spans over a full millennium.
Our strategy is not only innovative, it’s incredibly effective – a model that gives you access to a fleet of over 32,000 of our own 53-foot freight containers, and over 90,300 rail assets. This brings you the most flexible and reliable intermodal shipping service operating throughout North America. Plus, we know the kind of personalized attention this requires.
We can handle a variety of freight. From transporting hazardous cargo to using climate-controlled containers, we can match specialized equipment to your transportation needs.
Request a Quote
We are Movers of Marine Containers
Our Marine Container Solutions feature programs with the top ocean carriers, allowing us to offer competitive intermodal rates to our customers who utilize 20-foot, 40-foot, 40-foot HC and 45-foot containers.
We Are Coast to Coast and by Your Side
Hub Group’s relationships with UP, NS, KCS, CN, CP, CSX, BNSF, FXE and FEC railroads ensure flexibility and dependability.
We also offer cross-border shipping between the United States and Mexico. For information on Hub Group Mexico, click here.
Not only do our rail suppliers offer the most extensive networks in the country, they’ve made significant enhancements to decrease transit times and increase service across the board. Union Pacific invested approximately $4.3 billion in capital during 2015 to enhance the safety and capabilities of their 32,000-mile network. Norfolk Southern invested roughly $2.4 billion in 2015 to improve infrastructure. In total since 2011, Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have spent a combined $29.8 billion in capital expenditures. Improved capacity allows freight rail service to grow and promotes a cleaner environment. It also offsets fuel costs, which can save you a lot of money.
