Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

London, June 15, 2017 – Bloomberg hosted its International China investor roadshow themed “China: Navigate the New Silk Road” in London today. About 200 top Chinese and UK government officials, market participants and financial institutions attended the event to discuss China’s economic outlook and the investment opportunities and challenges in China’s bond and equity markets.
London has become a dominant offshore hub for trading the RMB. As of March 2017, SWIFT’s data shows that, over 36% of RMB transactions were conducted with the UK this year. Last year, China chose London for its first-ever sovereign RMB bond issued outside of China.

“The Belt and Road Initiative is helping to shape open, global cooperation. In building the Belt and Road, the UK and China have every reason to join hands. The UK’s strength, including experience, knowledge and creativity will find a good match with China’s strength such as unique growth model, technology and marketing capability,” said H.E. Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “This would definitely help London further consolidate its standing as a global financial centre. At present, London is the largest RMB offshore market outside China. These are opportunities for us to achieve win-win by increasing market connectivity.”
“The Belt and Road initiative and the opening up of China financial market present enormous opportunities to global investors,” said Constantin Cotzias, Bloomberg’s Global Head of Government Affairs. “Bloomberg is in a unique position to help investors find opportunities and connect the markets – and we’ll keep looking for ways to do that.”
In panel discussions, speakers from Aberdeen Asset Management, Bank of China, China AMC, China Europe International Exchange, China International Capital Corporation (CICC), Hefeng Family Office, HSBC, ICBC Standard and Bloomberg discussed the opportunities and challenges in China’s bond and equity markets.

In a survey conducted at the event, 43 per cent of respondents indicated that they are actively exploring investment opportunities in China’s bond market and 41 per cent said they have already entered the market. Market participants are optimistic about the outlook of foreign investment in China’s bond market with 41 per cent believing that although growth is slow this year, it will be exponential in the next five years. In comparison, 80 per cent of respondents are already investing in China’s equity market. However, majority of respondents (52 per cent) thought it is unlikely that China A shares will be included into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index this year.
Bloomberg’s market specialist Rachel Li introduced the recently launched Bloomberg RMB Bond Suite to investors in London. The RMB Bond Suite is the industry’s most advanced set of fixed incomes tools for onshore and offshore investors tracking China’s bond market.
This is the sixth year that Bloomberg is bringing its signature International China investor roadshow to London. The roadshow will covers over 10 cities worldwide in 2017, providing platforms for global investors to better understand and appreciate the opportunities of investing in China.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.
