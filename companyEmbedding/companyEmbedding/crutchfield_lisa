Product Research

Features
Compatibility: The Nikon EN-EL23 Lithium-Ion rechargeable 
battery pack is compatible with select Nikon Coolpix cameras, including the 
P900, P610, P600, and S810c. The battery weighs approximately 1.2 ounces.
Battery Life: A fully-charged EN-EL23 battery, when used in 
the P900, will provide power for up to approximately 360 still images, or 1 hour 
20 minutes of movie shooting. Battery life with other cameras may vary slightly.
Charging Information: The EN-EL23 is typically charged in 
the camera using the EH-71P Charging AC Adapter, supplied with the camera. Charging time is approximately 
3 hours 40 minutes. When the camera is connected to a computer via USB, charging 
takes place in about 6 hours 10 minutes. Using the optional MH-67P Battery Charger, 
a fully-exhausted battery charges in approximately 3 hours 20 minutes.

Our Product Research Team
At Crutchfield, you'll get detailed, accurate information that's hard to find elsewhere. That's because we have our own in-house Product Research team. They verify what’s in the box, check the owner's manual, and record dimensions, features and specs. We stay on top of new products and technologies to help people make informed choices.
