CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
 
OF
 
PINKBRICK HOLDINGS INC.
 
(Pursuant to Section 102 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law)
 
1.     The name of the
corporation is Pinkbrick Holdings Inc. (the "Corporation").
 
2.     The address of its
registered office in the State of Delaware is 1811 Silverside Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19810, County of New Castle. The name
of its registered agent at such address is Vcorp Services, LLC.
 
3.     The nature of the
business or purposes to be conducted or promoted is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized
under the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the "DGCL").
 
4.     The Corporation is to have perpetual
existence.
 
5.     The total number
of shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is: eighty five million (85,000,000). These shares
shall be divided into two classes with seventy five million (75,000,000) shares designated as common stock at $0.0001 par value
per share (the “Common Stock”) and ten million (10,000,000) shares designated as blank-check preferred stock at $0.0001
par value per share (the “Preferred Stock”).
 
The Preferred Stock of
the Corporation shall be issued by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in one or more classes or one or more series within
any class and such classes or series shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations,
preferences, limitations or restrictions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine, from time to time.
 
Holders of shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share held at all stockholders' meetings for all purposes, including the election
of directors. The Common Stock does not have cumulative voting rights.
 
No holder of shares of
stock of any class shall be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase or receive any part of any new or additional
issue of shares of stock of any class, or of securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, whether now hereafter authorized
or whether issued for money, for consideration other than money, or by way of dividend.
 
6.     The Board of Directors
shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation.

7.     No director shall
be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such director
as a director. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law, (i)
for breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL hereafter is amended to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the
limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended DGCL. No amendment
to or repeal of this Article 7 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation
for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment.
 
8.     The Corporation shall
indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, as amended from time to time, each person that such section
grants the Corporation the power to indemnify.
 
9.     The
name and mailing address of the incorporator is Blake Baron, c/o Richardson & Patel LLP, 405 Lexington Avenue, 49th
Floor, New York, NY 10174.
 


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
undersigned, being the incorporator hereinbefore named, has executed, signed and acknowledged this certificate of incorporation
this 12th day of November, 2014.

Pinkbrick
Holdings Inc.
Notes
to Financial Statements
 
1.
Organization and Description of Business
 
Pinkbrick
Holdings Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination.
 
Going
Concern
 
These
condensed financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis because the stockholders have undertaken to provide continuing
financial support so that the Company is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.
 
2.
Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The unaudited financial statements included
herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and notes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the
three months ended February 29, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim
period or the entire year. For further information, these unaudited financial statements and the related notes should be read
in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2015, included in the Company’s
annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2016.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of the condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
 
Cash
 
Cash
includes funds held in the Company’s bank accounts.
 
Uninsured
Cash Balances
 
Cumulative
balances in excess of $250,000 for 2016 per institution are not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company. At February
29, 2016 the interest bearing deposits which exceeded the federal depository coverage were approximately $0.
 
Preferred
and Common Stock
 
The
Preferred Stock of the corporation may be issued by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in one or more classes or one or
more series within any class and such classes or series shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and
such designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine, from time
to time. Holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share held at all stockholders meetings
for all purposes, including the election of directors.
 
Income
taxes
 
The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities
be computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will
result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus
the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
 
The
Company has no unrecognized tax benefits at February 29, 2016.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
This
section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements,
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not
directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,”
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”
“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and
similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may
differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes
thereto, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters,
months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in November and the associated quarters, months and periods
of those fiscal years. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue
into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future.
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
 
Business
Overview; Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months
 
Pinkbrick
Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was organized as a vehicle
to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being
a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time is to achieve long-term
growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential
candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury, if any, or with additional money contributed
by our management, stockholders or another source. The Company, based on current business activities, is a “blank
check” company. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines those companies as “any development stage company that
is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified
company or companies.” Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank
check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also a “shell company,” defined in Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does
not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully
concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for
so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
During
the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of Exchange Act reports and costs relating to consummating
a business combination. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts,
as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
 
We
may consider a business combination with a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of
additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established
business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative,
a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital,
but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant
expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.
 
Our
management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business
combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject
to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable or early stage or potential emerging growth
companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance
that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
 
Our
management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing,
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s
plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another.
 
We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions,
rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there
are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital that we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly
traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of, and investors
in, a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business
combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.

Results
of Operations
 
Three
Months Ended February 29, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended February 28, 2015
 
We
have not earned any revenues since our inception in November 2014. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we
are able to enter into a business combination.
 
We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of $6,000 for the three months ended February 29, 2016, compared with $18,991 for the
three months ended February 28, 2015. The entire amount for both periods was attributable to operating expenses, principally costs
associated with Exchange Act filings.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
As
of February 29, 2016, we had $0 in current assets, $24,000 in liabilities and $(245) in working capital. We currently do not engage,
nor do we intend to engage, in any business activities that provide cash flow until we enter into a successful business combination.
 
In
its March 1, 2016 report, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
We
expect that our management and the Company, through its various contacts and affiliations with other entities, will locate a business
combination target. We expect that funds in the amount of approximately $30,000 will be required in order for the Company to satisfy
its Exchange Act reporting requirements during the next 12 months, in addition to any other funds that will be required in order
to complete a business combination. Such funds can only be estimated upon identifying a business combination target. Our management
and stockholders have indicated an intent to advance funds on behalf of the Company as needed in order to accomplish its business
plan and comply with its Exchange Act reporting requirements, however, there are no agreements in effect between the Company and
our management or stockholders specifically requiring they provide any funds to the Company. Therefore, there are no assurances
that the Company will be able to obtain the required financing as needed in order to consummate a business combination transaction
 
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
As
of February 29, 2016, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
 
We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under
this item.
 
Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
As
of February 29, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. This was due to our status as a shell company
and our limited resources, including the absence of a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise.
 
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended February 29, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

View Pinkbrick Holdings Inc. Quartely report 3/2016 SEC Filing for free. The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
