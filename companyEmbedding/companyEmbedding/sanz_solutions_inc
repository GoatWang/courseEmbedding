Company Assessing Investor Interest, Looks to File Reg A Plus Tier 2 to Raise Additional Working Capital






Miami Lakes, Florida (PRWEB)
April 27, 2016
 Sanz Solutions, Inc. (Sanz) announced today that it has launched online a "Testing the Waters" campaign at http://Sanz.Solutions/RegaPlus  to gauge potential investor interest in the going public transaction. The Company is measuring public support by targeting family, friends, customers, dealers, vendors and others as it seeks to raise up to $3MM of additional working and investment capital to support its growth strategies and surpass its operational goals. 
Sanz Solutions, Inc. stated that its intention is to file a Regulation A Plus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upon its "Testing the Waters" campaign reaching the threshold of $500K. The Company disclosed that it is targeting investors through targeted social media and through email campaigns inviting them to participate in the "Testing the Waters" campaign for the possible Regulation A Plus offering.
In the past only qualified investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms have had the opportunity to invest via special securities in private to public transactions. This has changed as of June 2015 through the passing of the JOBS Act in April 2012 and the SEC's recent release of the regulations governing the new rules. In light of this change, the Company is considering allowing existing customers, dealers, friends, and investors along with the general public to participate in the Sanz Regulation A Plus Offering. The Regulation A Plus offering will be presented to investors in the order they participated in the "Testing the Waters" campaign. If you are interested in finding out more or participating in this going public transaction, you can indicate interest through the dedicated webpage, http://Sanz.Solutions/RegaPlus 
Sanz must first qualify the offering with Federal regulators, before investment into this Regulation A Plus deal can occur. Prior to doing so, Sanz is "Testing the Waters" to gauge market demand from potential investors for an Offering under Tier II of Regulation A. No money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response, it will not be accepted. Offers to buy securities cannot be accepted, and no part of the purchase price can be received, until an offering circular on Form 1-A is qualified. Any offer can be withdrawn or revoked at any time before notice of its acceptance is given after the qualification date of the offering circular. No sales of securities will be made or commitment to purchase accepted until qualification of the offering statement by the Securities and Exchange Commission and approval of any other required government or regulatory agency. An indication of interest made by a prospective investor is non-binding and involves no obligation or commitment of any kind. No offer of securities will be made without a qualified offering circular.
The Company is working with Teton International Advisors Inc., http://www.TetonInt.com  a boutique consulting firm that specializes in reg a plus, crowdfunding and social media. The company also reported that it has retained Harold P. Gewerter, Esq. of Gewerter & Dowling as the company’s securities attorney for the A/1 filing. The company has not retained a registered PCAOB, firm for the company’s audit.  The Company's web domain is http://www.Sanz.Solutions

Sanz Solutions, Inc. Launches Regulation A+ Tier II SEC Qualified Offering
























MIAMI LAKES, FL, Apr 24, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
The Company's campaign is targeted to raise $2.5M in equity capital and able to take investments immediately


                                        








MIAMI LAKES, FL--(Marketwired - Apr 24, 2017) - Sanz Solutions, Inc. (Sanz) announced today it has launched its Regulation A+ Tier II Offering online at         www.SanzRegA.com
. The Company's campaign is targeted to raise $2.5M in equity capital and able to take investments immediately. On March 14, 2017, the Company was notified by the SEC that it had qualified its Form 1A Application. This qualification allows the Company to move forward with the Offering which will leverage the key component of the Reg A+ Tier II rules allowing for the solicitation of the general public as well as traditional investors and financial institutions.


                                        








"The additional capital will help us grow our company faster, but Reg A + is about creating jobs and new opportunities. And it's about providing a level playing field for all types of investors to access investments that only a handful of venture capital, private equity investors have enjoyed up until now. Reg A + is a big win for entrepreneurs because it helps open access to capital, and a win for investors as more people will have the investment opportunities that they simply didn't have access to before," stated Juan Usatorres, President of Sanz Solutions.


                                        








Sanz qualified the Offering with Federal regulators before any actual investment into this Regulation A+ Tier II Offering occurred. Prior to doing so, no money or other consideration was being solicited, and if sent in response, was not accepted by the Company and returned promptly. Offers to buy securities could not be accepted, and no part of the purchase price could be received until the offering circular on Form 1-A was qualified by the SEC. Any offer can be withdrawn or revoked at any time before notice of its acceptance is given after the qualification date of the offering circular. An indication of interest made by a prospective investor is non-binding and involves no obligation or commitment of any kind. The Company's Regulation A+ Tier II Offering will be presented to investors in the order they participated in the "Testing the Waters" campaign and open to anyone else interested in the Offer.

Sanz Solutions Inc.

Sanz Solutions, Inc., a Florida corporation, offers shared service solutions for small businesses that provide routine services for residential and commercial clients specifically focused on the janitorial, cleaning, lawn care and maintenance industries.
Sanz Solutions provides a multitude of programs and benefits to assist independent business owners and small companies better service their clients.  By pooling resources, these companies are able to access professional expertise, guidance and services that would otherwise be cost prohibitive. The company's initial service center will be located in Miami Lakes, Florida.  Intended services offered at Sanz Solutions' centers include communications, marketing, public relations, administrative, accounting, financial, tax, information technology, human resources, and legal services.
Sanz Solutions target market is the janitorial, construction, cleaning, lawn care and maintenance industries because this market is primarily comprised of independent business owners and small companies who lack the resources to obtain the professional expertise and guidance necessary to ensure company growth and success.
Industry and Competition
Janitorial and Cleaning Industry
The cleaning industry can be roughly divided into residential cleaning, commercial janitorial services, specialty cleaning and laundry/dry cleaning services. In 2015 there were approximately 875,000 businesses employing about 3.5 million people.
The industry as a whole is very susceptible to economic downturns and suffered when revenue fell 5.3% in 2008 and another 6.1% in 2009. General cleaning services, and particularly residential services, are considered to be an expendable luxury during financial difficulties. However the industry as a whole has strengthened over the past few years, and in 2015 generated $51 billion in revenue.  Strong economic activity is forecast for the next 5 years as well, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics is predicting job growth of about 6% from 2014 levels to 2020.
The industry is highly fragmented, consisting of both public and private businesses and self-employed workers. The two largest players in the industry are ABM Industries and ServiceMaster, a publicly traded company that owns several national franchises such as The Maids International, Molly Maid and The Cleaning Authority. ABM Industries is also publicly traded but focuses more on providing integrated facility solutions to commercial and industrial markets. The rest of the industry is made up primarily of small, independent contractors. Small, independent janitorial companies account for 70% of the cleaning contractors.
Lawn Care and Maintenance Industry
This industry includes landscape and lawn maintenance, landscape contractors, landscape architects, irrigation contractors, and lawn and landscape product suppliers.  The landscape industry in the United States employs almost 1.6 million workers and generates almost 959,000 jobs in other industries.  The landscape services industry has annual revenues of $78 billion, annual growth of 3.9%, employs 969,257 people, and represents 474,237 businesses.  It is estimated that the lawn care services sector alone generates about 704,000 jobs and $35.6 million in value-added services annually in the US.
Over the five years to 2016, growth in the domestic housing and property markets have led to greater demand for landscaping services. Over the next five years, steady per capita disposable income growth is projected to encourage households to continue outsourcing yard care. Moreover, general economic recovery will likely boost commercial expansion, driving the need for industry operators that can maintain large corporate and resort campuses.
However, this industry is highly fragmented and the top 50 lawn care services companies generate about 15% of the total revenue in the industry, and the remaining 75% percent of the lawn care / landscaping industry is driven by small business owners.
Challenges to Small Businesses Competing in Service Industries

The janitorial industry and the lawn care industry are both service oriented industries that are overwhelmingly comprised of small independently owned small businesses.  Small businesses in the service industry face specific challenges which attribute to nearly half of all new companies failing within the first year and 75% within five years.  Lack of proper tools and resources to handle these challenges results in the average cleaning company losing up to 55% of their customer base every year due to poor service.
Many small business owners face unsurmountable difficulties and challenges as they pursue their business model.  Such times when these entrepreneurs need expert advice, guidance, and assistance from business professionals, they lack the resources to engage the help required.  Without proper guidance, access to best practices and proper information, these owners struggle or completely fail.
In these industries, a majority are run by less than 5 employees and require the owner to focus on areas outside of their scope of expertise and away from areas that promote growth and customer retention.
Time Management
One of the largest factor contributing to the downfall of a small business is the lack of time management.  Small business owners perform several tasks that can take up time on their daily schedule. Entrepreneurs often find it difficult to balance a schedule that includes sales and marketing activities, the search for financing, product development, accounts payable, accounts receivable and business development. Generally these items are not the entrepreneurs strongest skill sets, and as such, take the owner longer to complete, and are done without the care and diligence of a professional in that field.  If a small business owner is unable to hire help in these areas, it can be difficult to give every aspect of the business the attention it requires.
Employee Training & Turnover
Small operators also suffer from employee turnover, and poor staff training.  Poor staff training is especially damaging to this industry as customer service and retention is key to success. Training and ongoing training are crucial in order for a cleaning company to survive and thrive.  However, high employee turnover creates an ongoing obstacle to proper staff training.  Small businesses struggle to attract and keep top talent that can help them move ahead. Employment packages that include health benefits, vacation days, sick days and profit sharing are common with larger corporations. Small businesses have a problem competing with these kinds of employment benefits. Higher wages from larger corporations also attract employees away from small businesses and make it difficult for small businesses to reduce employee turnover.
Accounts Receivable
Small businesses in the service industry are also susceptible to accounts receivable delays that can cripple the company if not handled properly.  Many of these businesses lack the resources to offer advanced technology payment solutions or a dedicated accounts receivable department to ensure proper and timely payment needed to maintain cash flow. Slow collections can be detrimental to the continued operations of a small service business.  The service industry is especially vulnerable to this area, as the company typically outlays the cost for the service - ie the labor and supplies, and does not collect until after the job is complete.  Small businesses must pay for the labor costs and supplies to complete a job even if the client does not.  Small businesses can run out of capital very quickly if finances are not budgeted properly and if clients delay payment.
Marketing
Marketing and advertising are an important way for any business to reach new clients, and with a limited marketing budget it can be a struggle for a small business to reach its target audience. Advertising can be expensive; and even with the many forms of free marketing available on the Internet (social networking websites, blogs, company websites), it is still difficult to reach a target audience without investing in other forms of marketing such as television and print.  Many small business owners also lack the knowledge or skill to manage online technology, and do not have the resources to hire web professionals to maintain a company website, social marketing, and search engine optimization(SEO).
Access to New Technology
When new technology is introduced, it can be expensive to implement. A small business may not have the financial or technological resources to take advantage of new technology that a larger company may have, and this puts the small business at a distinct disadvantage in the marketplace.
Sanz Solutions Shared Services Centers

Sanz Solutions will establish shared service centers that provides a multitude of programs including communications, marketing, public relations, administrative, accounting, financial, tax, information technology, human resources, and legal services to assist small companies in the janitorial, construction, cleaning, lawn care and maintenance industries better service their clients.  By pooling resources, these small companies are able to access a wealth of features and savings that would otherwise be cost prohibitive.

At the heart of Sanz Solutions is the belief that by combining resources, small businesses will be able to provide consistent, and excellent customer service.  To this goal, the Customer Service departments will offer a variety of solutions, including appointment scheduling, customer relations, customer follow up and standardized retention policies.  By utilizing a central customer service department, companies can eliminate redundant activities and improve efficiency, services and overall customer satisfaction.  Employees will receive high level training and ongoing training to ensure the goal of exceeding customer expectations.
Human Resources Division
Sanz Solutions Human Resources Division intends to provide customers a full range of HR services including employee labor relations, equal employment opportunity services, payroll, benefits administration, employee relations, employee records management, recruitment, screening, classification services, reporting, strategic planning, workforce planning, and personnel transactions.
Financial Management

Launches Regulation A+ Tier II SEC Qualified OfferingMarketwiredApril 24, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareMIAMI LAKES, FL--(Marketwired - Apr 24, 2017) - Sanz Solutions, Inc. (Sanz) announced today it has launched its Regulation A+ Tier II Offering online at www.SanzRegA.com. The Company's campaign is targeted to raise $2.5M in equity capital and able to take investments immediately. On March 14, 2017, the Company was notified by the SEC that it had qualified its Form 1A Application. This qualification allows the Company to move forward with the Offering which will leverage the key component of the Reg A+ Tier II rules allowing for the solicitation of the general public as well as traditional investors and financial institutions."The additional capital will help us grow our company faster, but Reg A + is about creating jobs and new opportunities. And it's about providing a level playing field for all types of investors to access investments that only a handful of venture capital, private equity investors have enjoyed up until now. Reg A + is a big win for entrepreneurs because it helps open access to capital, and a win for investors as more people will have the investment opportunities that they simply didn't have access to before," stated Juan Usatorres, President of Sanz Solutions.Sanz qualified the Offering with Federal regulators before any actual investment into this Regulation A+ Tier II Offering occurred. Prior to doing so, no money or other consideration was being solicited, and if sent in response, was not accepted by the Company and returned promptly. Offers to buy securities could not be accepted, and no part of the purchase price could be received until the offering circular on Form 1-A was qualified by the SEC. Any offer can be withdrawn or revoked at any time before notice of its acceptance is given after the qualification date of the offering circular. An indication of interest made by a prospective investor is non-binding and involves no obligation or commitment of any kind. The Company's Regulation A+ Tier II Offering will be presented to investors in the order they participated in the "Testing the Waters" campaign and open to anyone else interested in the Offer.The Company recommends to any investor to read its Form 1A Statement and other public reports and financials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for further information. All public filings, financials, management profile and other Company information are available on the Company's web site.
