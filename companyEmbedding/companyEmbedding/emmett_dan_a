Biography[edit]
Of Irish ancestry, Dan Emmett was born in Mount Vernon, Ohio, then a frontier region. Growing up with little formal education, he learned popular tunes from his musical mother, and taught himself to play the fiddle. At age 13, he became an apprentice printer and enlisted in the United States Army. He became an expert fifer and drummer at Newport Barracks, Newport, Kentucky, and published his own Fifer’s and Drummer’s Guide in 1862 in cooperation with George G. Bruce. After receiving his discharge from the army on July 8, 1835, he joined a Cincinnati circus. In 1840–1842 he toured with Angevine and other circuses as a blackface banjoist and singer.[3]
In association with Billy Whitlock, Dick Pelham, and Frank Brower, he organized the Virginia Minstrels, which made their first appearance before a paying audience at the Chatham Theatre in New York City in 1843.[4]




Photograph of Dan Emmett in blackface, probably early 1860s.


Although blackface performance, in which white men painted their faces and hands black and impersonated caricatures of African-American men and women, was already an established performance mode at that time—Thomas D. Rice had created the character of Jim Crow nearly a decade earlier, and blackface had been widely popular ever since—Emmett's group is said to be the first to "black up" an entire band rather than one or two performers. The group's full-length blackface performance is generally considered to have been the first true minstrel show: previous blackface acts were usually either an entr'acte for a play or one of many acts in a comic variety show.
Emmett is traditionally credited with writing the famous song "Dixie." The story that he related about its composition varied each time he told it, but the main points were that he composed the song in New York City while a member of Bryant's Minstrels. The song was first performed by Emmett and the Bryants at Mechanics' Hall in New York City on April 4, 1859. The song became a runaway hit, especially in the South, and the piece for which Emmett was most well known. Emmett himself reportedly told a fellow minstrel: "If I had known to what use they [Southerners] were going to put my song, I will be damned if I'd have written it."[5] After the South began using his song as a rallying call, Emmett wrote the fife-and-drum manual for the Union Army. Emmett's song was a favorite of President Abraham Lincoln, who said after the war ended in 1865, "I have always thought that 'Dixie' was one of the best tunes I ever heard... I insisted yesterday that we had fairly captured it."[6]
Another writer named William Shakespeare Hays (1837–1907) (pen name: Will S. Hays) claimed to be its true author. Members of the Snowden Family of Knox County, Ohio, have also been named as writers of the song.
Death and posthumous recognition[edit]
After a tour that was notably successful in the South, Emmett retired to his hometown of Mount Vernon in 1888[7] where he died on June 28, 1904, aged 88 years. From 1893 to the time of his death, he was aided by a weekly allowance from the Actors Fund of America. Emmett was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. A biographical film of his life was produced in 1943, titled Dixie. Starring Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, it is a musical directed by A. Edward Sutherland.
Numerous schools, businesses, and other institutions in Mount Vernon, Ohio, are named after Emmett. The official memorial to him is a large boulder with a placard attached located in front of the Knox County Historical Museum.[8]
Emmett published at least 30 songs between 1843 and 1865, most of which are banjo tunes or walk-arounds. Between 1859 and 1869, he composed another 25 tunes that are in manuscript at the Ohio Historical Society in Columbus, Ohio.[9]

(Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)   By Dan Emmett  By Dan Emmett  March 28, 2014      Dan Emmett, a former Marine Corps captain, retired Secret Service agent and former CIA intelligence officer, is the author of “Within Arm’s Length: A Secret Service Agent’s Definitive Inside Account of Protecting the President,” forthcoming in June.   These are disturbing days for the agency charged with protecting the president of the United States. From prostitutes in Colombia to drunkenness in Amsterdam, it is no wonder that so many members of Congress — as well as former agents — have lost patience with a Secret Service that can’t seem to stay out of the news with embarrassing and high-profile cases of misconduct. I was a Secret Service agent for 21 years, spent two tours of duty on the Presidential Protective Division and four years on the Counter Assault Team (CAT), and was part of trips for three presidents. I retired 10 years ago and have no dog in today’s agency fights. I do not believe that alcohol abuse is a cultural problem within the Secret Service. (In fact, many agents do not drink at all, and those who do tend to consume in moderation.) The problem in the agency is not alcohol or debauchery, but weak leadership. There are too many incompetent managers who want the title, pay and perks of management while performing no duties of leadership. The problem is not bad Secret Service agents but bad leaders of Secret Service agents. The United States Secret Service was created in 1865 and began protecting the president in 1902. During 110 years of presidential protection, the agency accompanied presidents on hundreds of thousands of domestic and overseas trips without bringing any unwanted attention upon itself. That is because, in my experience, agents tend to be intelligent, well-trained and fiercely patriotic Americans — nearly fanatical in their devotion to the mission at hand. Yet, history shows that even the best units perform poorly with poor leaders, and the Secret Service is a prime example. The most disturbing common thread among the recent episodes of misconduct is that supervisors or team leaders have been involved. While it is unacceptable for any agent to commit infractions such as those in Amsterdam and Colombia, it is utterly inexcusable for those in charge to be involved. If managers show continued lapses in judgment, how and why would anyone expect the rank and file to behave better? The Secret Service may not admit it, but its promotion system is primarily designed to move the best-liked people, not necessarily the best-qualified, into managerial positions. Much like in a college fraternity, a small group of senior agents votes on who will be promoted. These decisions are based as much on office politics, popularity and political correctness as the abilities of those being considered for upward mobility. While this practice is widespread in many professions, it is unacceptable in an agency whose primary function is to keep the president of the United States alive and safe. Competence should be the overriding concern in all government agencies, but especially so in an organization whose agents stand next to the president and other top officials with loaded firearms. The agency doesn’t prioritize competence among its managers, yet it somehow stands baffled about why it cannot control the behavior of its agents, forcing the director to return to Capitol Hill again and again to apologize for their conduct. The apologies may temporarily appease critics, but they do nothing to address the catastrophic failure of leadership within the organization. When I became a Secret Service agent in 1983, we were generally well led. Most of our top and mid-level supervisors were armed forces veterans; they managed and led by the ethos of military leadership, which dictates accomplishing the mission while taking care of those entrusted to them. They expected much from their subordinates but knew that they must set the example we would follow. The Secret Service of today is awash in managers, not leaders. Many supervisors have little tangible or leadership experience, yet they are designated as managers on the basis of their titles and long lists of schools attended. Alas, leadership cannot be taught in a classroom alone. In the military, people must first pass Officer Candidate School before assuming leadership roles. In the federal government, more often than not, people are promoted first and then trained to be leaders — the concept is entirely backward. In December, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general issued a report finding no evidence that “misconduct is widespread” in the Secret Service. Though it was dismissed as a whitewash by some critics, I view the findings to be quite correct. The problem of leadership, however, stems in part from the department’s oversight of the Secret Service. From its creation until shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Secret Service fell under the Treasury Department, where it operated efficiently and largely unencumbered. However, after Osama bin Laden attacked America, the Secret Service became part of the Department of Homeland Security — a massive and nightmarish new federal bureaucracy. In this environment, many young and ill-prepared agents were promoted to positions of management far too early in their careers to supervise a significant number of new positions. Today, many of those agents who were promoted too soon are at the highest levels of the Secret Service.         1 of 18       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                         Skip Ad   ×           Myths of 2014      View Photos   Fact or fiction?

A collection from Outlook’s popular Five Myths series.    MYTH: Sanctions never work. “The most complete academic studies on the matter show that sanctions lead to concessions from the targeted government in one out of every three or four cases,” writes Daniel W. Drezner in “Five myths about sanctions. “That is a far cry from never working.” Here, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel leave a joint news conference at the White House in May. The leaders discussed additional sanctions to punish Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. Charles Dharapak/AP  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.           Whenever an elite organization expands too rapidly, care must be taken not to compromise standards. Unfortunately, this was not always done during the large expansion of the Secret Service that followed Sept. 11.  The tragedy of this horrid and ineffective system is that many highly qualified agents who would be superb leaders are passed over for promotion; they are not in “the club.” The result is evident in today’s embarrassing headlines. Can this train wreck be put back on track? Can the Secret Service regain its respect? I believe it can. But congressional overseers need to agree that there is a massive leadership problem in the agency and start a general purge of some top-level managers through forced retirement. Then the Secret Service should begin a leadership school for entry-level managers, preferably conducted by the military. While major corporations and the federal government have become huge proponents of every type of management and business school imaginable, and have spent millions of dollars sending their neophyte managers to them, the military best understands leadership in its most basic form — and that is what the Secret Service is missing. Finally, the next director should come from outside the agency, rather than rising up through the rank and file. When drastic changes are needed, it is difficult for someone who is friends with almost everyone in headquarters to make objective decisions. In this case, the agency needs someone with no allegiances to top-level managers. The best leaders willingly take responsibility for the actions of their people. When I was a 23-year-old second lieutenant with the 1st Marine Division, my first company commander informed me that he would hold me responsible for everything my men did or failed to do. His hard lesson: It is the commander who bears the ultimate responsibility for subordinates’ actions. This lesson seems to be unique to the military, though it should apply non-uniformed government workers, too. If high-ranking officials were terminated or disciplined for the infractions of their wayward subordinates, rather than the wrongdoers themselves receiving all the punishment, perhaps there would be fewer incidents such as the ones haunting the Secret Service of late.  outlook@washpost.com   Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter.         opinions   Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREWithin Arm's Length: A Secret Service Agent's Definitive Inside Account Of Protecting The Presidentby Emmett, Dan"Dan Emmett was just eight years old when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The events surrounding the President's death shaped the course of young Emmett's life as he set a goal of becoming a US Secret Service agent--one of a special group of people willing to trade their lives for that of the President, if necessary. Within Arm's Length is the essential book on the Secret Service--a revealing and compelling inside look at the Presidential Protective Division (PPD) with stories from some of the author's more high-profile assignments in his twenty-one years of service, where he provided arm's length protection worldwide for Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, and George W. Bush, both as a member of the PPD and the Counter Assault Team. Dan Emmett describes the professional challenges faced by Secret Service agents as well as the physical and emotional toll that can be inflicted on both agents and their families. Within Arm's Length also shares firsthand details about the duties and challenges of conducting presidential advances, dealing with the media, driving the President in a bullet-proof limousine, running alongside him through the streets of Washington, and flying with him on Air Force One. With fascinating anecdotes, Emmett weaves keen insight into the unique culture and history of the Secret Service and the inner workings of the White House"--Military, 21st CenturyCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

The New Granola: How Richmond's Health Warrior Built a Chia Empire 

            By Brandon Fox
@bpfox

Health Warrior
Health Warrior helped the Tarahumara reclaim a drought-ridden farm to produce its first crop of commercial chia seeds. Each tiny one is planted by hand.





It’s a daunting trip to the bottom of Mexico’s Barrancas del Cobre, the Copper Canyons of the Sierra Madre. The cliffs are high — higher than the Grand Canyon’s — and the winding roads to the bottom are narrow, with a sheer precipice that hugs the tires of a rugged SUV all the way down. 
“Lots of bad things happen down there and probably will,” Christopher McDougall writes in his book, “Born to Run”: “Survive the man-eating jaguars, deadly snakes and blistering heat, and you’ve still got to deal with ‘canyon fever,’ a potentially fatal freak-out brought on by the Barrancas’ desolate eeriness.”
 click to enlarge                                                   Health Warrior                                                                 Mexico’s vast Barrancas del Cobre are larger than the Grand Canyon.                      
But it isn’t all freaky emptiness — people live there. The Tarahumara are an indigenous people whose members retreated to this unforgiving part of Mexico when the Spanish conquistadors arrived. They have limited contact with the outside world, and the tribe ekes out a living through subsistence farming.
Still, that’s not what fascinates most people about the Tarahumara: They are, despite, or perhaps because of, the formidable terrain, the best long-distance runners in the world. 
And there’s an unexpected connection between this remote running tribe that lives deep in the canyons of Mexico — and Richmond.
Chia seeds. 
More specifically, the company that popularized them in the United States — Scott’s Addition-based Health Warrior — directly links them to this city.
McDougall’s bestselling book inspired the company’s founders, Shane Emmett, Dan Gluck and Nick Morris, to swerve unexpectedly into entrepreneurship.
 click to enlarge                                                   Scott Elmquist                                                                 The chia bars produced by Health Warrior are selling by the millions.                      
After reading “Born to Run,” Morris began experimenting with the tiny seeds that the Tarahumara mix with water — called iskiate by the tribe, or chia fresca in Central America — to help keep them going on their long, grueling runs.
In his 30s, Morris says, his diet “had gone to crap.” But after he began consuming chia, he says: “I started feeling better. I started losing weight and having more energy.”
The nutrient-dense seeds are loaded with fiber, protein, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. But they were difficult to find. 
Morris asked his friend, Dan Gluck, what he thought about them. Gluck, a dedicated long distance runner who still competes in Ironman competitions and marathons across the country, says he became, like Morris, obsessed with chia.
“I really started noticing a difference in my overall level of energy,” Gluck says. “It was then that I started telling other friends about them — with no intention of starting a business.” 
In 2009, both men were working together at a hedge fund in New York, but there was a key difference between the two. Gluck was an investor in the coconut water company, Zico — and he started drawing parallels.
“Zico took a product that was genuinely healthy, indigenous to another country — and popular in another country — but unknown here in the States,” Gluck says. He saw an opportunity to bring chia seeds to a wider audience.

But neither Gluck nor Morris wanted to ditch their day jobs and work full-time to launch a new business. They were spending nights researching chia and looking for suppliers, and they needed help. Enter Shane Emmett — “the greatest human being in the world,” Morris says. 
Emmett, a former lawyer for Barack Obama’s campaign, was finishing up a stint working for then-governor Tim Kaine. Emmett was at loose ends.
The call from Gluck, his former college roommate, came at the perfect time. “I didn’t want to go work for a real law firm,” Emmett says. “Working for [Kaine] was the most interesting legal job I’d ever have.”
Like Morris, Emmett was getting older and wasn’t in the best of shape. He’d reached a point that most of us do when we hit our 30s — the realization that we aren’t immortal, that health matters. All three men had been athletes in college, but only Gluck was still active. 
More importantly, Emmett also was ready for a new cause.
“In typical Shane fashion,” Morris says, “a day later we’ve got a 65-page report of how great chia is and what an opportunity this is.”
A food-industry startup is expensive, so the partners decided to start selling their product on Amazon. The three found a source in South America that could provide the kind of chia seeds they were looking for: a clean product, for one thing. Tiny sticks and rocks usually came along with seeds at the time. They also found one that could be tracked from the farm to the distributor and matched the nutritional profile claimed. And fortunately, chia is a hardy plant, so it’s unusual for farmers to use pesticides on their crops. Even irrigation is mostly unnecessary. 
There wasn’t a lot happening with the seeds online. The three were working out of their homes and had garages piled with product. Emmett says he had 5,000 pounds of chia seeds stored in his condo’s hallway at one point.
A co-founder of Bear Naked Granola, Kelly Flatly, gave them some advice: Get Health Warrior into independent natural food stores.

Qimare competed in the 2016 Boston Marathon wearing handmade huaraches and traditional garb.                      
Emmett enlisted his brother, Casey, who lived in New York, and the two began trying to convince store owners to give them shelf space. They figured out which were the top-selling stores in the country — surprisingly, Richmond’s Ellwood Thompson’s Local Market held the No. 2 spot. The rest, unsurprisingly, were scattered throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. The brothers convinced stores to take the product on consignment, with Ellwood Thompson owner Rick Hood as their first supporter.
It was a hard sell to customers. At demos, they offered samples of the seeds mixed in water. “Honestly,” Casey says, “it grosses people out.”
It’s a drink that’s been compared to frog spawn — chia seeds soak up the water around them and form a gray gel, leaving the little black seed right in the middle, suspended in the drink. Although chia is almost tasteless, the texture that it creates is an unusual one — slick, with a little pop when you crunch it between your teeth.
Making it tougher, no one knew anything about the seeds. For most people, the terracotta Chia Pets hawked on television was the only frame of reference. “If we sold 10 bags in a week,” Casey says, “we were psyched.” 
It wasn’t long before Emmett, Gluck and Morris realized that they needed to sell the seeds in a more palatable form. But they wanted a specific product, one that was a legitimately healthy snack — packed with nutrients, low-calorie and low in sugar — that tasted great.
  Most of the health bars on the shelves — Clif Bar and Lunabar leading the way — largely were things full of sugar that could be called cookies with added nutrients.
“My theory,” Emmett says, “is that sugar is a lot cheaper than using chia seeds or pumpkin seeds or almonds.” If you pump up the sugar, you can pump up the profits. 
Once they had a bar they liked, things began puttering along with the retail business. And then, all hell broke loose.

 click to enlarge                                                   Scott Elmquist                                                                 The company’s chief executive, Shane Emmett, has no plans to move Health Warriors’ headquarters out of Scott’s Addition.                      
Shane Emmett is a towering, bearded man in his late 30s — you can instantly see why he was an athlete in college. He’s also quick to smile and he finds ways to tell his story that’s endearingly self-deprecating, even though he’s been running the show at Health Warrior since his partners more or less took a back seat once the initial team was in place.
“It’s quite remarkable,” Gluck says, “but during the five years or so we’ve run this company, we’ve never had one disagreement or argument.”
With his partners up in New York, Emmett ran — and still runs — the day-to-day operations of the business in Richmond. That meant a lot of traveling, pounding the pavement and in-store demos.
“We were going around and just asking for a shot,” his brother says. “We didn’t know how to write an invoice — we didn’t even know how much this stuff should cost.”
Within one 24-hour period, that all changed. The Wall Street Journal published a story about Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and his secret superfood.
“I was not aware that Ray Rice eats Chia Pets,” teammate Terrell Suggs said in the article. The product sold out on Amazon in an hour, and Health Warrior suddenly had a supply problem.
“We were totally out of stock for two months,” Emmett says. 
About a month later, Whole Foods came knocking. It wanted to launch the bars nationally. “We had no money, we barely had employees and didn’t know what we were doing,” Emmett says. They had four months to get the bars on Whole Foods’ shelves. 
Jesse Itzler, a former rapper under the name Jesse Jaymes, and a partner in Zico, through which he met Gluck, came in as an investor in the company, in what Emmett calls a friends-and-family round of financing. The local investor group New Richmond Ventures came aboard too.
Soon, once Health Warrior found its place on Whole Foods’ shelves, it found athletes investing, including running back Arian Foster of the Houston Texans. He also became the face of the brand in the early days. 
Growth was explosive. Austin Harris, a young analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, had taken the leap in 2012, coming on as chief financial officer. “BB&T thought I was insane,” he says. His co-workers gave him a Chia Pet as a parting gift.
 click to enlarge                                                   Scott Elmquist                                                                 The members of Heath Warrior’s team avidly pursue outdoor sports and share a commitment to change the American diet. They work in two buildings across the street from each other near Isley Brewing Co.                      
Harris helped the company get up to speed, establishing payroll and accounting systems as Health Warrior rapidly expanded. Like the founders, he’s passionate about the outdoors — running, cycling and hiking. He also worked with a lot of food-related businesses at BB&T. 
“I’m a really active person,” Harris says. “Those two themes collided right around the time I met Shane.” Emmett knew he needed a finance guy — “someone who can count,” he said. Harris created the financial backbone of the company. 
At the same time, Emmett “never thought of Health Warrior as a company that’s just going to make a product and sell it to people,” Harris says. “That’s never what it’s been about. Health Warrior — and Shane and our other two founders — has always been about making the Western diet in general much better. Making people healthier.”
It’s a theme I hear repeatedly from everyone I talk to at Health Warrior. It’s a team of true believers. The bars are “radically convenient real food,” they tell me.
“If we actually want to change things,” Emmett says, “we can do it much more quickly and build value at the same time by doing it in our industry — which is exactly what we’re doing. We’re not the food police but food cheerleaders.” 
The growth has continued apace — 13,757 percent since 2012, to be exact. “Our first run was 25,000 [bars],” Emmett says. “We had no idea how we were going to sell all of them— the first batch came in the wrong wrappers, [and] the chia seeds were black and got stuck in your teeth.” Health Warrior now produces millions of bars a month in a manufacturing plant in Ohio. And the company has gone from around 20 stores in the beginning to more than 12,000 now. You can find them in Target, Wegmans and Kroger supermarkets across the country. 
Two years ago, industry group Seurat named Health Warrior as one of the top challenger brands, and in 2016, it took the No. 205 spot in Inc. magazine’s list of the 5,000 fastest-growing companies. Inc. reported that the company’s revenue was $9.8 million in 2015, although Emmett declined to share more recent figures. It now has 34 full-time employees, including a sales team that stretches nationwide, and a product line that’s expanded to include a protein bar and one made with pumpkin seeds that recently launched at Wegmans. Health Warrior rounds out its staff with another 20 part-time employees and 30 independent contractors. 
It’s a long way to come in five years. And more expansion is on the horizon — the company recently secured another round of financing. “We’re really building the company this year for what we’ll need next year,” says Emmett.
Still, Emmett, Gluck and Morris haven’t forgotten the people who metaphorically handed them their first chia seeds — the Tarahumara. The region has experienced crippling drought during the last few years and the tribe’s farms have been decimated. People are moving to towns and cities, and if the trend continues, it’s possible that the Tarahumara culture will be lost.
 click to enlarge                                                   Health Warrior                                                                 The first Health Warrior-funded farm inspired the company to create a Mexican chocolate bar for Operation Farm & Run, a Kickstarter to help the Tarahumara grow chia for the company.                      
Last year, members of the tribe grew their first commercial crop of chia seeds on a farm that Health Warrior helped restore. And several weeks ago, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign, Operation Farm & Run, to continue its work. It’s making a special Mexican chocolate bar that will use seed grown by the Tarahumara. Profits from the bars’ sales will go back to the tribe to help refurbish more farms and increase commercial chia production. 
The work is in line with Health Warrior’s mission. Emmett and his partners are sincere when they say that they want to leave the world a better place.
Along with “Born to Run,” two more books, Michael Pollan’s “The Omnivore’s Dilemma: a Natural History in Four Meals” and Dan Barber’s “The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food,” have inspired the three to push the company in a direction that takes into account more than the bottom line — health, a better planet and a hand stretched out to those in need are instead the goals that the company’s profits support. 
“Our vision is that better health builds a stronger society,” Emmett says. “It’s hard to have a healthy society if it isn’t [actually] healthy — people don’t feel good and it ladders up. That’s what we think, so we’re doing our little part to try and fix that.” S

Synopses & ReviewsSynopsisDan Emmett was just eight years old when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. From that moment forward, he knew he wanted to become a Secret Service agent?one of an elite group of highly trained men and women dedicated to preserving the life of the President of the United States at any cost, including sacrificing their own lives if necessary. Armed with single-minded determination and a never-quit attitude, he did just that. Selected over thousands of other highly qualified applicants to become an agent, he was eventually chosen to be one of the best of the best and provided protection worldwide for Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, and George W. Bush. I Am a Secret Service Agent skillfully describes the duties and challenges of conducting presidential advances, dealing with the media, driving the President in a bullet-proof limousine, running alongside him through the streets of Washington, and flying with him on Air Force One. With fascinating anecdotes, Emmett weaves keen insight into the unique culture and history of the Secret Service with the inner workings of the White House. I Am A Secret Service Agent is a must read for young adults interested in a career in federal law enforcement.
