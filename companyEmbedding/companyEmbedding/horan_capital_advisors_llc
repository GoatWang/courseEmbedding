Our Approach for Individuals
High-net worth investors have various complexities that need both planning solutions and investment solutions. What does this investment portfolio mean to me? What can I expect related to my cash-flow and growth of principal? How and when should I access my accounts for expenses? Are my affairs titled correctly for future beneficiaries? Do I or will I have a taxable estate?
By design, our active approach incorporates all aspects of planning, including generational wealth transfer strategies, charitable and tax efficient investment planning and risk management solutions. We find value in addressing financial planning early in our process and we aim to partner with your other advisory relationships such as estate planning attorneys, accountants and private bankers.
Our portfolio management team works to customize an investment approach so that your assets are working to support your growth and income needs. We seek to maximize growth of principal while employing strategies that minimize market volatility. Diligent research, diversification and a global perspective provide the framework for the investments we make.
We believe the investment advisory business is truly about positioning clients to grow, sustain and protect their wealth.

PRESS RELEASE
Cincinnati, OH (PRWEB) February 25, 2014
HORAN Capital Advisors (HCA), an SEC registered investment advisory firm dedicated to high-net worth and institutional asset management clients, is proud to welcome Dale Wiethe as a Senior Portfolio Manager.
Dale has been in the investment management business for 23 years, and has held the position of portfolio manager for high net worth individuals, foundations, endowments, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans. He has extensive experience with asset allocation and portfolio construction, security analysis and investment policy statement development.
“Dale’s investment philosophy parallels that of HORAN Capital Advisors which will further strengthen the level of service the organization has demonstrated since being founded,” said Terence L.

Prior to joining HORAN Capital Advisors, Dale spent many years at several regional banks before joining Merrill Lynch. Before Dale entered the portfolio management field, he worked for a large family conglomerate in the Accounting and Treasury divisions doing credit analysis, foreign exchange trading and financial analysis.
“I believe the greatest rewards of this business are the lifetime of learning and client interaction aspects,” said Dale Wiethe. “I enjoy helping clients determine their goals and understand how investment markets fit in to achieving those goals. HORAN Capital Advisors is a great fit for me because of our shared philosophy that the investment advisory business is about providing clients with the best position to grow, sustain and protect their wealth.”
He holds a Bachelor’s of Business Administration degree in Finance, Insurance and Real Estate and a Master’s of Business Administration in Finance. Dale received both of his degrees from the University of Cincinnati.
