You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Description
In recent times, the development and manufacture of new products and the necessary tools required to carry out such activities has resulted in vast amounts of knowledge and information being generated. In order to support product development, there is a requirement to capture the knowledge of the manufacturing processes within the organization, which includes the process, materials, resource, design rules, capacity and other constraints that may limit the capabilities of the organization. This book proposes a decision system to support product development. This includes a knowledge based system which identifies, captures, formalizes, and utilizes knowledge within a product development. The outcome is an effective decision support providing information and knowledge in the place, time and format required, thus ultimately reducing product development costs and improving quality. This book will be useful to both academic researchers and industry practitioners who would need to continuously refer to a knowledge base to enable effective decision making in a production environment.Auteur Chike F. Oduoza, is a Professor in Process and Manufacturing Engineering at the School of Technology, University of Wolverhampton and leads the Engineering and Product Design research group. He is a Chartered Chemical Engineer and a Fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers and chaired the UK Society of Chemical Industry (SCI) from 2006 - 201
