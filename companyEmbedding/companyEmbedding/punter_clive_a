At the 57th annual FEPE Congress in Barcelona last week, I joined out-of-home advertising leaders from across the globe to talk about “The Road Ahead” and what will shape our OOH future. This year’s conversation centered on the biggest opportunities and challenges facing our industry: The digital landscape and the optimization of our new digital capabilities (data, mobile, programmatic) and how our bright future can be shaped. After all, we’re only beginning to see the incredible possibility digital technology brings to outdoor advertising in a hugely connected and out-of-home enabled world. Geo-fences that serve mobile ads primed by OOH messages, connected screens that display dynamic content and the build-out of programmatic exchanges for outdoor displays are just some of the advancements revolutionizing our industry. The talent and knowledge needed to shift our organizations to maximize our new possibilities is as important as the advancement themselves.
