Equipment & TechnologyThe right solutions for your unique practice









Patterson works with a diverse group of manufacturer partners to connect you to the equipment and technology solutions that are right for your unique practice. Driven by a long history of innovation, we enable every practice to offer a best-in-class patient experience while improving efficiencies that enable practice growth. Every practice can benefit from innovations in equipment and technology. Among the many benefits new technology brings are improved diagnostics, optimized workflows, a boosted bottom line, and more satisfied patients.
Digital imaging products – both extraoral and intraoral – have an immediate impact on diagnostics and image quality. Beyond digital impressioning and restorations, CAD/CAM technology lets you take on implantology and orthodontic cases. And up-to-date operatory equipment enables smoother workflows and efficiencies. It’s not just through equipment and technology, either. Patterson also offers practice management software solutions that keep your practice running efficiently and effectively.

    Scott Paterson                Saabnet.com Poverty2Prosperity.org Facebook Kiva Loans LinkedIn Twitter Contact     Tweets by @ScottyInCali  Poverty2Prosperity.org Saabnet.com Saab 97 Sonett   Scott Paterson Online      I'm Scott Paterson and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife, Elle, and daughter, Lily Bee. I have six sisters and one brother. I grew up inRochester NY and went to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.   Who is this guy? I was born in 1967 (the sixties) and my first name is Robert but I go by Scott. I was also given my grandmother's maiden name of Vrooman hence my initials are R.S.V.P. I had a great childhoodand started playing hockey when I was 5 - I would later re-discover it in College and play through adulthood. I started running in middle school competitively and after spending a yearliving in France with my mom and going to public school (learning to speak in about 3 months), I started high school and began running seriously. As a senior, I ran 10 miles in 52:14 and the mile in 4:19. Later,as a freshman at Dartmouth College, I improved on my mile by running a 4:14. After that, I had a series of injuries (back, 4 stress fractures at once in my legs, and my achilles blew out) and I didn't getmuch further. I tried running for a number of years, but the injuries mounted and the miles dwindled to zero. That's when I re-discovered my passion for ice hockey which I still play three-four times a week.During college, I bought my first Saab - a 1985 900 Sedan. I was on the Internet (we had hardwired connections in our dorm rooms) looking for some advice on a leaking water pump and when I posted a questionon rec.autos, the responses I got where along the lines of "you should have bought a BMW or a Ford or whatever". Since that was decidedly unhelpful, I decided to create a mailing list just for Saab owners andin the fall of 1988, I created The Saab Network.In the first year there were about 100 users and the mailing list grew to about 3,000 when the web was born and I took the discussions and createdSaabnet.com - the first Saab resource on the Internet. Since then, the site has had well over a million Saab visitors with literally, billions of hits and millions of pagesaccessed every single month. The bandwidth was so demanding, I had to have a T1 (1.5Mbps) installed at my house for something like $800 a month. Now it resides on a 50Mbps connection that costs about $150 a month.I created The Saab Network on my Mac SE which had a 20MB hard drive (the first hard drive I ever owned - I actually started out with a Mac 512KE) and I've been producing The Saab Network site on Macs ever sincealthough the server has always run on Linux (currently Red Hat Linux). I'm a certified Mac fanatic - our household of three also includes three iPhones, 4 Macs, an AppleTV, and a few iPods.After college I went directly to work for Novell working on messaging software doing technical marketing. Mostly I wrote technical papers for end-users, gave demonstrations, worked trade shows, did quite a bit ofpublic speaking and generally became a know it all on our products. Unfortunately and sadly this became the story of my professional career, Novell was dominated by Microsoft and while I gave up on the messaging, I stayeda couple years longer working on server-based TCP/IP (Internet) services like ftp, web, telnet and others. I generally had a good time at Novell and when I went to my exit interview after I resigned, I really didn't haveanything to complain about other than the company going into a tail-spin.After that stint, I joined Be, Inc in 1996. That was exciting. Be was working on a revolutionary new operating system designed for general user use on Macs and later PCs but also specialized in optimized media performance.The system was very impressive. I did product marketing and again wrote quite a bit, did a TON of public speaking mostly to user groups and any crowd that would gather for a demo - a lot of trips to college campuses - I evengot to return to Dartmouth to give a demo. I think the thing that most impressed that audience was that an English major could be so technical. I eventually 'graduated' to Director of Marketing with a team of about 8 peoplereporting directly to me and I reported directly to the CEO, none other than Jean-Louis Gasee himself (former President of Apple, Inc.). After sadly declining a $200M offer to be bought by Apple (by the way, I love Mac OSXevery day, so having them buy NeXT instead worked out in the end for me [not so financially, I admit]), I ran headlong into Microsoft again. We were selling a PC version of the OS, but we couldn't get any OEM deals becauseMicrosoft threatened to revoke their licenses if they bundled any other operating system pre-installed. So, in 1999, with a bleak outlook, I resigned again, but the good news is that Saabnet.com was making a decent livingfor me so I got to take that up full time.Jump ahead to 2008 and I discovered microlending. I was so enthralled by my ability, through Kiva.org, to make a $25 loan (as part of a larger amount that was crowd-sourced) tosomeone in the third world who was poor and didn't have access to traditional credit, but who wanted to lift themselves out of poverty by starting or continuing a business. This was a way to give a help-out ratherthan a hand-out. I was so excited that I wanted to do more than just my own personal lending, so I went through the process to create an official 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called,Poverty2Prosperity.org that allowed corporations or individuals who didn't want to have to manage a microlending account/portfolio on their own to donate funds to belent out perpetually (we call it a perpetual fund). The great news is that repayment rates to date are over 99% and our lending team has made over $2M in loans (12/13).Just after I started that effort, my daughter, Lily Bee, was born on June 28th. Kim Shu was our nanny for about two and half years and that gave Lily Bee some extra attention while Elle and I worked full-time, but sinceLily Bee turned 2 1/2, and since I have a very flexible schedule, I've been primarily taking care of Lily before and after school. It has been the most enjoyable few years and I get so much joy from all the time Iget to spend with her. She's the most amazing girl and I write about her all the time on my Facebook timeline just like most parents do.In 2012, after doing some volunteer work in the area of addiction, I created RandomScreening.com. This site provides a service, mostly aimed at home users, for those thatwant to schedule random drug tests and receive notifications daily if it is time to take a test or not. It allows families to take the bias out of determining when a drug test is to be taken. Nobody is telling anyoneelse that, today, they have to take a drug test for no reason or any reason. The software simply says whether today is a test day or not based on the variables (like percent chance for a test to happen on any given day) thatthe users set.I am also very interested in physics. If you want to read a book that will totally change your view of our universe and give a good explanation why we live in a steady-state universe, check outHidden in Plain Sight 2: The Equation of the Universe.If you are a Kindle user, it's just 99 cents.After my so-called professional career was well-over, I started my tattoo collection. I now have nine tattoos all below my knees and a sleeve. In all, I have 43 flowers tattooed on my body (I love flowers and flowergardening). You can see my tattoo gallery by clicking the linked image below.  I'm also a fan of Deth P. Sun art. I never had much of a connection to art - got a D in Art History at Dartmouth - but my sister in law, Joanne, introduced me to some local, young artists and I connected with Deth's work.I own 19 paintings, one print, and two tattoos of his work. Click on the image below to see the paintings we own.  So, that's kind of who I am and what I do and in my last hockey game (championship game) I had a hattrick - I tied the game with 38 seconds left and then we won with a goal with 8 seconds left (12/13).  Scott's Favorites...
