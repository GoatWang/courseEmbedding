About Us – Venture Capital
 Home About Us – Venture Capital 




Our Firm – Venture Capital







  
  
  






We take a unique approach to investments, and it has to do with the people in, behind, and associated with our firm. We make all investments as a team; every member of our firm is involved in every investment that we make. We seek the advice of a wide range of expert advisors. Our Limited Partners include both strategic partners (several large biotech and pharma companies) and qualified financial investors. We listen to our LPs and include their expertise in our diligence. We believe we make better decisions this way.







Additional Information



 
Our Philosophy – Venture Capital
 


venBio invests in promising companies at various stages: from early to late stage, and from academic startups to spinouts. We tend to lead most of our investments, and we enjoy building syndicates and teams.
We are mindful of potential acquisition partners from the outset, and we ensure that our companies are best positioned to meet their requirements. This includes IP, CMC, and the details of clinical trials, including indication, trial design, endpoints, powering, and regulatory considerations. Our team’s expertise and involvement helps companies make a bigger impact, and this leads to impactful and lasting relationships with the leaders that we work with.





 
Our Venture Funds
 


Founded in 2011, venBio’s venture funds comprise approximately $520M of committed capital. We are currently investing out of our second fund of $340M committed capital. Our team combines scientific, clinical and operating experience in our investment decisions. Paul Brooke, a former Managing Partner, retired in 2016.






Our Mission

  We seek out teams who are developing treatments that will have a meaningful impact on patient care. Our mission is to put our companies in the best possible position to succeed, by helping teams think through the best development plan to bring these therapies to patients.

About Us – Venture Capital
 Home About Us – Venture Capital 




Our Firm – Venture Capital







  
  
  






We take a unique approach to investments, and it has to do with the people in, behind, and associated with our firm. We make all investments as a team; every member of our firm is involved in every investment that we make. We seek the advice of a wide range of expert advisors. Our Limited Partners include both strategic partners (several large biotech and pharma companies) and qualified financial investors. We listen to our LPs and include their expertise in our diligence. We believe we make better decisions this way.







Additional Information



 
Our Philosophy – Venture Capital
 


venBio invests in promising companies at various stages: from early to late stage, and from academic startups to spinouts. We tend to lead most of our investments, and we enjoy building syndicates and teams.
We are mindful of potential acquisition partners from the outset, and we ensure that our companies are best positioned to meet their requirements. This includes IP, CMC, and the details of clinical trials, including indication, trial design, endpoints, powering, and regulatory considerations. Our team’s expertise and involvement helps companies make a bigger impact, and this leads to impactful and lasting relationships with the leaders that we work with.





 
Our Venture Funds
 


Founded in 2011, venBio’s venture funds comprise approximately $520M of committed capital. We are currently investing out of our second fund of $340M committed capital. Our team combines scientific, clinical and operating experience in our investment decisions. Paul Brooke, a former Managing Partner, retired in 2016.






Our Mission

  We seek out teams who are developing treatments that will have a meaningful impact on patient care. Our mission is to put our companies in the best possible position to succeed, by helping teams think through the best development plan to bring these therapies to patients.
