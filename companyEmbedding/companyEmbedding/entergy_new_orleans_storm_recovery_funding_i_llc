Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For the full year, the company reported a loss of $(3.26) per share on an as-reported basis and operational earnings of $7.11 per share. The as-reported losses for the quarter and full year resulted from asset impairments reflecting the effects of strategic decisions in the EWC business.“2016 was a pivotal year for our company - a year in which our objectives were ambitious and our execution was on the mark,” said Entergy chairman and chief executive officer Leo Denault. “We completed our plan to exit the merchant power business and transition to a pure-play utility. While previously disclosed charges at our EWC business led to an as-reported loss, adjusted earnings at our core Utility, Parent & Other business increased by more than 40 percent in 2016. Our strong operational results for the year are the outcome of disciplined execution on our strategy over the past few years, a strategy intended to fundamentally reposition our company and set it on a steady, predictable earnings and dividend trajectory.”Business highlights included the following:
