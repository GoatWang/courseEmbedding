TRUST FCU - About Us





























About Us



Trust Federal Credit Union is a federally chartered credit union with primary operations in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  We service employees of Unum Corporation, Cigna Corporation and many smaller businesses.  
In addition, anyone who lives, works, worships or attends school in downtown Chattanooga may join.  If anyone in your family is a member, you are also eligible. 





Mission Statement

To provide safe and sound financial services and products to our field of membership while maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity.





Vision Statement

To offer financial products at competitive prices coupled with superior member service utilizing the most efficient delivery channels available. 





History

In 1934, employees of Provident Life & Accident wanting better banking services banded together to form Provident Employees Credit Union.  Over the years the name has changed several times as our membership has changed and is now known as Trust Federal Credit Union.





Ownership

At Trust Federal Credit Union, you are treated like the owner.  This is because you are the owner.  Trust Federal Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial institution owned by the members.  Each member has an equal share in the credit union.  Unlike banks, profits from the credit union’s operations are reinvested in additional services to benefit you the member, not used to satisfy Wall Street investors.





Safety and Soundness

Your deposits are federally insured up to $250,000 by the NCUA at Trust Federal Credit Union.  We maintain a capital ratio that is considered “well-capitalized” by the NCUA.  TFCU did not contribute to the financial melt-down that occurred in 2008 and 2009 and did not receive TARP funds.  We have not invested in high risk securities or made sub-prime mortgage loans.  At TFCU, your money is as safe as it can be anywhere. 





Community Involvement
We take our role as a partner in the community seriously.  Trust Federal Credit Union has been a proud supporter of Chattanooga Room in the Inn along with many other charities, local and national.  Our employees have spent hundreds of hours in support of our community during the past year.   





Why Trust?

We value you as a member.  You are more than an account number with us; you are a member of our community.  Decisions are made with your best interest in mind as we do not have stockholders to appease.  Plus, we offer big bank products with credit union service and pricing.  









Your savings federally insured to at least $250,000. National Credit Union Administration, a U.S. Government Agency.












We do business in accordance with the Federal Fair Housing Law and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
