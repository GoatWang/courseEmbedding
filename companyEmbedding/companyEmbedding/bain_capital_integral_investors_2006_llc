A termination agreement is a document used when a business arrangement is terminated. The agreement is most often used in an employment context, such as when an employee leaves a company. A tenant and landlord may sign a termination agreement when a tenant no longer rents from the landlord.The document specifies the terms under which the relationship is terminated, why the relationship was severed, and the conditions of the agreement. For an employee, a termination agreement may contain clauses regarding confidentiality, a waiver of the right to sue, and severance pay, if applicable.There may be also a non-compete clause, and terms regarding an employee's obligation to disclose information about their employment to future employers. The agreement will also contain what state of governing law the contract is under. The termination agreement lets both parties be aware of their rights and agreements for the termination.
