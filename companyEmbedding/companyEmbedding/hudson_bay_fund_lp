Overview


Firm History


Team


Leadership






Firm History 
Hudson Bay Capital is the successor to Gerber Asset Management, a proprietary investment firm established by Sander Gerber in 1997 after a successful career as an equity options market maker on the AMEX. Gerber Asset Management specialized in investing proprietary capital across a broad range of investment strategies, many of which we still utilize today. 
In 2005, Gerber Asset Management sought to offer its investment strategies to outside investors, leveraging its existing infrastructure, personnel and investment process to form Hudson Bay Capital. Originally perched at the top floor of the historic Equitable Building in downtown New York City and adjacent to Wall Street, our offices overlooked the point where the Hudson River meets the New York Bay (giving rise to our “Hudson Bay” name). In 2011, we outgrew our Wall Street headquarters and relocated to Midtown Manhattan where all of our investment and business operations are currently domiciled.
We believe that our team’s experience in successfully managing a proprietary investment management firm for many years without any fee income differentiates us from other investment firms. In particular, by relying upon our ability to generate persistent absolute returns, we fostered a culture that was extraordinarily focused on downside protection and capital preservation. Disciplined risk management was ingrained into the DNA of the firm and is a distinguishing characteristic of our investment philosophy.

Overview


Firm History


Team


Leadership







Sander R. Gerber Chief Executive Officer / Chief Investment OfficerMr. Gerber is Hudson Bay's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer.  He also functions as a Portfolio Manager who opportunistically invests in special situations in addition to monitoring and hedging tail risks.  Mr. Gerber has over 24 years of investing experience in multiple securities classes and derivatives across a broad range of strategies. In 1991, he became a member of the American Stock Exchange, acting as an options market maker. The experience Mr. Gerber gained on the AMEX in managing risk, pricing complicated derivatives and identifying profitable strategies, as well as efficiently managing trade execution and clearing costs, enabled him to leave the floor in 1995 to explore opportunities using his proprietary capital in other markets. In 1997, he founded Gerber Asset Management LLC (“GAM”) to develop and engage in proprietary investment strategies, many of which are utilized by Hudson Bay today. In 2005, assisted by certain key employees of GAM, Mr. Gerber founded Hudson Bay which absorbed GAM's business and 15 employees.
Prior to becoming a member of the American Stock Exchange, Mr. Gerber was an Associate Consultant at Bain and Company, a leading strategic management consulting firm, where he assisted the senior management of multinational corporations to identify and implement corporate growth opportunities. Mr. Gerber graduated Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania, with a BSE in Finance from Wharton and a BA in Humanistic Philosophy from the College of Arts and Sciences.
Mr. Gerber is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and The New York Economic Club. Mr. Gerber was formerly the Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars (the "Wilson Center"), a public policy research center within the Smithsonian Institution, where he still serves as Chair of the Investment Management Committee.
