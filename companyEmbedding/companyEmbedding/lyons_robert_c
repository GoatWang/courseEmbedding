This is Dr. Jaime Garza responding to the review written on 7/14/2011 by "beautiful":I am so sorry that you didn't get the results that you wanted, and I'm sorry that you didn't have the positive experience most of my patients have. I certainly remember you and your surgeries. I first performed a rhinoplasty on you over 7 years ago. It is my understanding, reviewing our records, that you were quite happy with your results at your three month and twelve month postoperative visits and that you even requested a second operation after your three month visit on another facial structure to further enhance your appearance, which I performed to your satisfaction. I certainly wish that I could have your permission to post your photographs so that you would be able to see that your ethnicity was not only maintained but enhanced as you requested and I agreed with. There is no evidence in your postoperative photographs of a crooked nose or a pointy tip. I last saw you 2 ½ years after your initial surgery and all was well at that appointment. We never heard from you again until my office saw this review. If I fail to provide the best result possible given the limitations of the patient’s individual features, I'm always willing to make things right. Unfortunately, unless a patient tells me they're not happy with their results, I cannot address the problem effectively. Because of the disparity in our views of your results, I want to make sure that we do not have our wires crossed and that you are actually the patient that we are referring to in this response. I am more than willing to make every attempt to address and resolve the issues you have raised to your satisfaction. Every patient matters to me, so I hope that you will call my office to clear up any misunderstanding that may have occurred. Sincerely and respectfully. Jaime R. Garza, MD, DDS, FACSDonald D Dilworth PAJames E. rated Saw and was treated by this doctor for a bilateral inguinal hernia repair. Truely amazing doctor. Office wait was moderate length. Told me from the very beginning in good detail what he was going to do with the mesh. Listens and responds extremely well which seems to be somewhat rare for alot of doctors. Went to NE baptist to get my surgery taken care of by him. The hospital wait was 2-3 hours overall but once I was wheeled in and put to sleep, I was awake before I knew it with 2 scars on my groin. Hospital staff was very courteous and friendly, great nurses, as well as his own staff at his office. Pain was alot for me at first, but this was my very first surgical procedure. Was put on some basic hydros and the doc put a pain belt on me that was connected to my 2 nerves in my groin that greatly eased the pain with regular set injections of numbing meds. Overall I'm greatly satisfied with how it went and how I feel now after 2 weeks recovery and am very pleased to not have any of the problems I've currently had for years now with my 2 hernias and can now live a normal active healthy life again. It does take a while for your body to get used to the mesh though. Would recommend this doc to just about anybody. 5 stars.Gonzaba Medical GroupKaren K. ratedWas planning to change to another practice until I found out we were moving out of state.  I originally switched to this office because it was closer to our home.  I've had three doctors and a couple of them spoke English with such a heavy Hispanic accent that even I had trouble understanding them and I've lived all over the world and have been exposed to many accents.  My next complaint is that almost every time my prescriptions were changed or I changed pharmacies and gave them the new one, they'd send the prescription to the old one or fail to renew at least one of the prescriptions.  The people were all friendly, but friendly doesn't help if they continually get something else wrong.  There is a huge turnover in the Gonzaba Medical Group from what I can tell in doctors.  One of the best they have is Dr. Denise Tarver.  She only takes Medicare patients and is wonderful and thorough.  Unless you get her first appt of the day or after lunch, expect a long wait because she doesn't herd her patients through like cattle and is constantly running late.  But I'd rather she take her time and study my mom's records, although it's hard on the elderly to have to wait that long though, especially when a patient is over 90.Bandera Family Health Careharrydean.hood.9 ratedBandera Family Health Care wit...Bandera Family Health Care with Dr. Ramon Reyes and his wonderful assistants and staff provide the best health care in the San Antonio, TX Metro area.  Reyes is a wise and capable doctor.  His rapid dianosis and actions very possibly prevented my death when he determined I was infected with an e-coli infection.  He initiated action and treatment that brought my temperature down from 105 to normal and continued treatment and medication till the terrible issue was resolved..  Over the past several years he continues to treat any of my ills with great success.  Furthermore, his assistants and staff provide me fast, friendly, and excellent care and attention.  He continues to add medical facilities/staff that provide one-stop examinations; thus, many times, eliminating the need to drive around the medical center area seeking exams. His facility is growing and expanding and I recommend my family and friends utilize him and his facilities.  Again - Dr. Ramon saved my life.  To me, he and his facility/staff are number one.  Harry Dean Hood, retired aviation consultant, Helotes, TX. Gonzaba Medical GroupSra V. ratedDr. William,                So sorry that I’ve gone to urgent care.  Never thought they could have received me with a doctor, but God knows no energy is. I really have suffered.  Also maybe because I didn’t want to have heart surgery that has never bothered me.  The cardiologist told it was from birth.  I hear they call it a murmur.  I hardly never read the papers that I get at my appt.  Only I started off balance than on top of it I fell.  Luckily I didn’t break my ribs and Melissa Gonzales saw me at Urgent Care.  But you don’t know how much I’m grateful.  I should have gone to the hospital.  There’s no words to express myself to all your employees.  They’re very kind and willing to help me.  I was an orphan.  My Dad died when I was 3, my Mom in 1938 so I didn’t have any school.  I would go to the field to pick cotton.  Those times were hard, but at least I learned a little 3rd grade.  Well again, I just wanted to thank you.  May the Lord richly bless you.  My God I brought back the 30. Sra Dora VillarrealFirefly Pediatrics PllcTia B. ratedI just moved to San Antonio and had some problems with my old Dr keeping up with records and really even listening to my concerns over my children. I called firefly because I needed help with my children's shots before school even though I though my kids old Dr had already done it, seeing as though I took them just for that reason and was told they were up to date. The Dr and staff at fire fly listened to all my problems and concerns about my children and immediately tried figuring out the problem and fixed everything withought a problem. I loved every staff member I met that day and the Dr came in several times asking different questions and just really taking the time to get to know us. It was quick,enjoyable, they took our insurance and I'm excited to finally feel like we have a Dr who pays attention. It's worth the 30 min drive from my house and I'm so please I found a good Dr in San Antonio for my babies. They deserve the best!!!!!Villanuevawindow2soul ratedDr, Villanueva is the most fantastic OB/GYN in the World!Dr. V has been my OB/GYN doctor for 16 years, since I was 20 years old.  He is incredibly patient and caring.  He looks you in the eye when he talks to you and when he is listening to you.  He asks you if you have any concerns and addresses them professionally with educated answers and information.  He has taken care of me many years prior to pregnancy, during my pregnancy, and now afterward.  He was previously part of a practice with other OB/GYNs, but opened up his own individual office about 2 years ago, i believe.  He told me personally that he wanted to do this because he wants to better serve his patients which he is able to do with his own practice.  The hospital he delivers babies at is right across the street from his office.  I have always been comfortable talking with Dr. V as well as during my exams,  My mother has seen Dr. V for many years now as well.  We both just love him!  He is wonderful!Alprin Clifford NLynne M. ratedI love Dr. Alprin, but his appointment clerk (Jamie) is abrupt and rude.  When you are not feeling your best to begin with, do you really want to have a conversation with a person who makes you feel like you're bothering them?  I worked for Medical Associates at the Nix Hospital for years and we would have been fired for speaking to patients in a rude and abrupt manner.  We always treated our patients with respect.  And yes, we were very busy, but we took our time with each patient.  First of all, we loved all our patients and we were always happy to see them.  More times than not, Dr. Alprin's clerical staff seem totally disinterested and unapproachable, but Jamie takes the cake.  "Staff" please get a personality!  Dr. Alprin's patient's will appreciate it!Kellum Jr, Daniel H, MDbenjamin.roath ratedI recommend Dr. Kellum and all of his staff for all of your family medical needs.Dr Kellam has been our family doctor for over 10 years. Him and his staff are always thorough and very polite. Yes, sometimes there is a little bit of a wait. But, they always make up for it when it is your turn. What I really like is that they listen to everything and you never feel rushed like they're trying to get to the next patient. Not like so many other doctor offices where they barely hear you, in and out of the room taking care of other problems. When you are sitting down in front of Dr Kellum or one of his staff it is really your time and you can see that they really care and sensitive to all of your needs.  So, THANK YOU Dr. Kellum for taking care of my family and me. Benjamin E. RoathArzola Jennifer M MDBonnie A. ratedShe was my OB for my son ( second child) and she was awesome. Bc of my previous pregnancy and some complications that seemed recurring she wanted me to admit myself to the hospital earlier than usual. Which was the right thing to do bc she cared about my baby and making sure he was well taken care of and also myself. She fought my insurance when they didn't want to pay for my hospital stay and for me I knew she cared for the well being of my son. When a doctor goes over and beyond this way you know they are not in it for the money but because they care for their patients. It is difficult to find doctors such as Dr Arzola.   I highly recommend her!!Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
