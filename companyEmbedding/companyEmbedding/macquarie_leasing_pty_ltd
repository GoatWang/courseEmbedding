Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited Proposes Interim Dividend for the Half Year Ended March 31, 2016, Payable on July 1, 2016
May 13 16
Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited proposed interim dividend of 80 cents per share fully franked is down 7% reflecting a move to gradually consolidate ANZ’s dividend payout ratio within its historic range of 60%-65% of annual cash profit which provides a conservative, sustainable and fully franked dividend base for the future. The Final Dividend for FY16 is expected to be at least the same as the Interim Dividend in cents per share. The directors proposed that an interim dividend of 80 cents be paid on each eligible fully paid ANZ ordinary share on July 1, 2016. The proposed 2016 interim dividend will be fully franked for Australian tax purposes, and New Zealand imputation credits of NZ 10 cents per ordinary share will also be attached. Record date for determining entitlements to the proposed 2016 interim dividend was May 10, 2016.
