Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the
full $80,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any
proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Anatolii Antontcev, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Antontcev’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link when and if our
common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
and/or OTC Link. Mr. Antontcev will not be paid any compensation or anything
from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of
the funds advanced by Mr. Antontcev. Mr. Antontcev will be repaid from revenues
of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.
Additionally, we do not plan to use our proceeds to compensate our officers.


The business of niche of visa consultancy services is very competitive. Barriers
to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies
anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful visa consultancy
companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining
enough market share to become successful. These competitors have existing
customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such
clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to
our service. If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our
financial performance will be adversely affected.


Company Description
We are a company that seeks to provide visa consultancy services to individuals
or groups of individuals, and legal entities. We intend to consult our customers
on the terms of how to obtain a visa to a particular country, what the
requirements are for visa-free countries, for instance a maximum


 period of stay,
or countries issuing visa on arrival. We seek to provide full and up-to-date
information regarding documents, difficulties or any limitations in the process
of receiving a visa. We plan to assist in gathering documents and filling out
the forms either printed or online, as an embassy requires, or providing step by
step guidelines and instructions to a successful completion of the process. We
may also offer to send the document packages to embassies or other related
services.

The company is currently at the developing stage which means we are able to
provide basic operations seeking to improve our services and expand the list of
services we wish to be provided. Despite that there is a relatively long list of
visa-free countries, travelling abroad people might face various difficulties,
as it is not always clearly stated how a visa is obtained, whether it is issued
upon arrival, in case if it is, whether it is paid and what is the period of
visa-free stay. These data may vary from country to country. Some countries may
be visa-free in case the application is submitted through the website of their
embassy. Such complications may lead to rejection in visa obtaining process, so
we intend to to provide our services that may be described as consultation, or
guidance regarding the steps ought to be taken in order to receive different
kinds of visas to a foreign country. In case if the country is visa-free, but
the visa term is short, we may assist in prolonging the period of stay by
providing all the information from legal issues to any kinds of fees payment
procedures. In cases where visa is required or electronic visa may be issued, we
plan to provide our customers with full and up-to-date guidelines on what legal
or banking documents shall be gathered prior to the filling out the application,
how to fill out the application forms correctly, which sorts of visas require
receiving in person after an interview in the embassy, on the terms and time
spent waiting for the documents to arrive. Previously mentioned are the main
steps which we may split into smaller tasks and guide our customers through
every step. For instance, we provide the information regarding the list of the
documents and places where they may be received, as well as the amount of fees
paid, if it is required so. Also we may offer to collect those documents which
do not require being obtained personally, but can be received by proxy on legal
basis. We also may assist in making requests to the officials on behalf of our
customers, in cases when it is possible.

As additional services we may look for and provide interpreters for the cases
when the applicant must present in person. We intend to provide information on
legal procedures the applicant will have to go through in the country of their
choice depending on the aim of their visit, for instance if they have to be
registered with an official representative shortly after arrival and the
applicants fail to do so, or if they fail to leave the country of their stay
before the free term of stay expires. We plan to organize meeting with
immigration officers or deputies to conduct a meeting devoted to the procedures
of receiving visa for different purposes and the documents appropriate to that
kind of visa. We plan to provide the full step-by-step guidance and assistance
to our customers, as well as we plan to execute small independent operations
such as, guide through filling out only an application or, sending sealed
documents to the embassy and handing them back to our customers. If the business
succeeds it may expand into related markets and the company might offer
additional services such as hotel booking, airline or boat tickets booking,
transportation booking in the country of arrival and other similar services.

We provide our consulting servce in Thailand for Thai citezens. Thai people need
visa for many countries in the world. We provide visa consulting service for
visitors to Schengen area (26 European countires), USA (visitors visa type
B1/B2), Canada, UK, Australia, China, and/or about 30 other countries.

Specially Formulated Lubricants for the Appliance Industry
Dishwashers, washers and dryers, refrigerators, mixers, blenders, and many other appliances have rubber or soft plastic components such as hoses, O-rings, seals, grommets, plugs and more. The slip resistance of these parts makes assembly difficult.  P-80® temporary rubber assembly lubricants significantly reduce friction, helping these parts slide easily into place.

Specially Formulated Cleaners for the Food & Beverage Industry
Precision cleaners that provide consistent results with every use and leave surfaces completely clean. These cleaners have been proven in cleaning applications ranging from mixing tanks, processing equipment and fluid lines to labware, general maintenance, and filter membrane cleaning.

Specially Formulated Lubricants for the Automotive Industry
Rubber’s non-slip quality can make an automotive assembly process very difficult.  Without an assembly aid, tight-fitting rubber components can cause production to slow down, and quality and safety standards to slip. P-80® Lubricants provide a safe and easy way to improve automotive assembly operations.
