Rebecca Hornbuckle Wolfe Carter is my great-great-great grandmother on my mother’s side.  We know we are of Cherokee descent, but due to the very young deaths of my grandmother, great grandmother and great-great grandmother, we have hit roadblocks all along the way of fining out any information.  I have seen the report of being rejected on the Siler rolls because Rebecca denied being Indian.  I live in Kansas, along way from North Carolina.  I do have a second home in Greenville, South Carolina, which isn’t very far from Haywood County, N.C.,  and have been to Cherokee, North Carolina.  If you have any information on Rebecca, I would love it.  I am a descendent though her daughter, Susanna. Thank you!  Karolyn Tacha

Hello cousin!  I have hired a professional genealogist in Raleigh NC to find Rebecca’s parents.  Nancy works in the NC archives….
Rebecca never denied being Native.   That was what the town Cherokees said about her.  Siler told the rich [town] Cherokees that the more people he signed up, the less money any of them would get.   Guion Miller told them the same thing 50 years later…
I take it that your 3rd g grandfather was William Carter?  He was mine, also.
I have a lot of files to share.  Will email them to you.   Also, I have had my DNA tested and my Native ancestry is mainly on chromosome #15.  I am on Gedmatch:  kit #M185010.
I research as an obsession.   I am on facebook:   Marie Brito, with my kindergarten picture.  Keep in touch, we have several dozen cousins waiting for my genealogists’ report!

Rebecca Hornbuckle is my 5th great grandmother on my Mother’s side. I am descended through her daughter Barsheba. I just have found where the native american ancestry comes in.

Dear dcormierm,
    I am descended through Susan, daughter of Rebecca and William.  Do you know Rebecca’s official last name?  Was it Wolfe or Hornbuckle.  I have found where all of William and Rebecca’s children were added to the Siler Rolls in 1854.  Is this the same information you have?  Are you a card carrying member of the Cherokee Nation?

Dear Dcormierm:  Please join my Facebook Group, ‘Rebecca Hornbuckle + William Carter.  There are nearly 100 of your cousins there…

dcormier:  it is vital to our research that you take a DNA test.  You are  a 5th ggdaughter of Rebecca thru your mother;  and if your mother’s mother’s mother’s mother’s mother’s mother was Barsheba Carter who married Hardy William Russell, then your DNA results would prove beyond a doubt that Rebecca was Cherokee.  Please let me know if you would like me to pay for your DNA Family Finder test at FTDNA or for your Autosomal DNA test at 23andMe.
   If you descend thru a grandson or greatgrandson etc of Barsheba, then the results would still be interesting and I still would pay for the test.  Please let me know!

Hello, I have been researching my family tree and it seems that Rebecca Hornbuckle is my 5th Great Grandmother, through my great grandad on my moms side. I also have Rebecca’s parents. I would definitely like to know more about her as far as the Indian myth goes. I have not taken a DNA test but would love to.

cow4, the children applied to the Siler Roll and the grandchildren applied to the Guion Miller Roll, and all of them were rejected because they did not have Rebecca’s mothers’ name.  please come to my cousin page on Facebook.  friend me.  Marie Brito

marie-carter-brito – I found her parents through internet research, but haven’t found a birth certificate – William Lucullus Hornbuckle and Sarah Jane Harden.  From what I found she was born in Haywood County, NC.  
I am still researching details.  I will be happy to share what I find.

dcormier– I sent you an email with some of my research attached.  Was Sarah Jane Harden Cherokee?  Some of these Hornbuckles were in the Baptist Church.  You might find records there….

maria,
   I’m getting ready to send you a long e-mail.  Sorry it’s taken me so long to get back with you.  Thanks for the information.  I’m also wondering where the Native American blood comes from in Rebecca Hornbuckle’s ancestors.  Karolyn

Hello my mother was a descendent of hers through their son David carter. I would love any info that anyone could share with me. Anything on William carter would be extremely helpful also







marie-carter-brito says

Hi Cow4.  Been wondering if you were still living!
My email is Earthchild_Marie@yahoo.com and I would love to get an email from you and add you to my Facebook group!  ‘Rebecca Hornbuckle + William Carter’
  I still have not gotten the final report from the NC genealogist whom I hired last summer.  She is looking for Rebecca’s parents…   I think that Rebecca was born in VA and married several times before she married William.  She may even have been one of his cousins.









MichaelWade says 
January 12, 2017 at 5:37 am 

I have seen the Harden name come up as Rebecca’s mom, but I have another woman down as her mom based on my research.

I think our Rebecca was descended from an Indian slave who was owned by the Hornbuckles.  Or, she was related to the Bolins and raised by the Hornbuckles.  What is your guess?















marie-carter-brito says 
January 16, 2017 at 1:38 am 

I spend my days writing a genetic genealogy book for my Native cousins, and doing Painting comparisons for them at Gedmatch.  My Gedmatch # is M185010.  I have a cousin group on Facebook.  Anyone who wants into it, just email me at Earthchild_Marie@yahoo.com.  Yes I have a gedcom and hundreds of other research files, and love to share them with my cousins.  My first professional genealogist gave up on finding Rebecca’s parents, so I hired another–one of my DNA cousins–Michelle Centers.  Based on DNA research, I think that Rebecca’s father was part Catawba Indian and had OLD WORLD ancestors from both South Africa and India and the immigrant probably came to the Caribean Sugar plantations as a slave in the 1500s, and a descendant came to the eastern coast of what is now USA, as a slave in the 1600s or early 1700s, likely bought by a Hornbuckle family.  From documents, I do know that Rebecca’s mother was birdclan Cherokee, probably born in the mid 1700s in either NC, SC, or VA.
  No of course I am not a card-carrying Cherokee, unless you count my membership in a state tribe, The Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama.
  Just email me and I will send you what I have and invite you to the facebook group, which is not publically visible.  I am on Facebook, friend me and I will invite you…Marie Brito   pic of a little girl with long dark hair…
