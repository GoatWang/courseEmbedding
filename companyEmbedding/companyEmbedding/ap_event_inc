Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and "best-efforts" basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the
full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any
proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, August Petrov, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Petrov's verbal agreement to provide us
loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Petrov
will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this
offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr.
Petrov. Mr. Petrov will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we
generate sufficient revenues to pay the obligation.


As to the present date, the market of tourism is congested but the key
difference is that many companies provide tours or excursion services only.
There are many companies distributing the tickets to music events. By combining
both we will be able to occupy a relatively free niche with very few competitors
in it.

In order to take superior positions on the market comparing to other
competitors, we intend to provide the exclusive features as to:

1) provide our customers with leisure tours including transfer and admission to
   a music event;

2) provide accommodation, if mentioned - catering;

3) provide guided excursion around particular areas related to music;

4) provide customers with both online services and consulting on services in the
   office;

We strongly believe that narrowing preferences to particular music genres and
will result in growth of customers network and growth of profitability.
