Analyst

                                    Current                


North Run Capital LP


                  North Run Capital believes that inefficiencies in the public markets can cause meaningful disparities between the trading value and true value of various securities. They apply a fundamental value approach to determine the intrinsic value of a security, and they seek to identify catalysts to explain why the security is mispriced and to identify events or circumstances likely to cause the market to realize the security’s embedded value.While the majority of their investments have been in publicly traded equity securities and derivative securities of public equities, the funds may take long or short positions in equity and fixed income securities of all types, such as stock, options, warrants, equity swaps, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, currency, futures, commodities, distressed debt, governmental securities, MBS & ABS, loans, structured products, securitized products and other financial instruments. Investments include securities which are listed or traded on domestic exchanges or other trading networks, as well as securities listed or traded on foreign exchanges and securities traded in foreign or domestic over-the-counter markets. At times, a small portion of the funds’ portfolio may be in securities and other assets that are not freely tradable or are otherwise illiquid.

 Career History



Analyst

                                    Current                


North Run Capital LP


                  North Run Capital believes that inefficiencies in the public markets can cause meaningful disparities between the trading value and true value of various securities. They apply a fundamental value approach to determine the intrinsic value of a security, and they seek to identify catalysts to explain why the security is mispriced and to identify events or circumstances likely to cause the market to realize the security’s embedded value.While the majority of their investments have been in publicly traded equity securities and derivative securities of public equities, the funds may take long or short positions in equity and fixed income securities of all types, such as stock, options, warrants, equity swaps, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, currency, futures, commodities, distressed debt, governmental securities, MBS & ABS, loans, structured products, securitized products and other financial instruments. Investments include securities which are listed or traded on domestic exchanges or other trading networks, as well as securities listed or traded on foreign exchanges and securities traded in foreign or domestic over-the-counter markets. At times, a small portion of the funds’ portfolio may be in securities and other assets that are not freely tradable or are otherwise illiquid.                




Analyst

                                    Prior                


Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.


                  Merrill Lynch is one of the world’s premier providers of wealth management, securities trading and sales, corporate finance and investment banking services.  More than 60,000 professionals in 40 countries combine local market expertise with Merrill Lynch’s substantial global product resources, technology and capital.                




Associate

                                    Prior                


Carlyle Group Ltd.


                  Carlyle Group Ltd. provides executive search services. It recruits personnel to fill the positions from middle managers to senior executives. The company was founded in 1982 and is located in Chicago, IL.                




Professional

                                    Prior                


United States Peace Corps


                  The Peace Corps traces its roots and mission to 1960, when then Senator John F. Kennedy challenged students at the University of Michigan to serve their country in the cause of peace by living and working in developing countries. From that inspiration grew an agency of the federal government devoted to world peace and friendship. Today's Peace Corps is more vital than ever, working in emerging and essential areas such as information technology and business development, and contributing to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Peace Corps Volunteers continue to help countless individuals who want to build a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities.
