Finjan Holdings, Inc.
As a patent attorney, Julie Mar-Spinola has advised Fortune 500 companies for more than 25 years.
These days she is responsible for management, licensing, mobile and legal operations at cybersecurity licensing firm Finjan Holdings. She’s also the chairperson and co-founder of a non-profit that promotes women in intellectual property and technology.
Mar-Spinola is on several boards, including as a member of Santa Clara University School of Law’s High Technology advisory board.
She is a certified mediator for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on patent issues.
And, in 2015 U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker appointed Mar-Spinola to the patent public advisory committee.
She doesn’t limit her work to law and technology. Mar-Spinola was also on the board of Women’s Audio Mission, a nonprofit working to advance women in another field where they are under represented — music production.
Residence: San Jose
Education: Santa Clara University, School of Law (JD)
Job description: I am a member of Finjan Holding’s senior executive management team and responsible for legal operations, FHI's public policy and initiatives, FHI's subsidiary, Finjan IP portfolio, licensing and litigation programs, and FHI's subsidiary, Finjan Mobile's product development. I am also a member of the board of directors for Finjan Mobile and collaborate on the company's R&D, product development and business development.

Where were you born? Portland
What was your first job? Waiting tables at my parents’ tiny Chinese restaurant.
Growing up, you wanted to be: Good at whatever I did.




Employees: Under 20
Career path: I started in a hospital pharmacy, attended law school and became a registered patent attorney. I was a patent prosecution associate, then a big firm patent litigation associate, then chief IP cCounsel for a public high tech company (and later became its vice president for global affairs), then took a brief hiatus to spend quality time with my family. Returned to practice as a consultant, then as a co-managing partner at a small patent boutique, then general counsel for a VC-backed startup, then interim general counsel for two software companies, then joined Finjan as vice president, legal, which lead to current multiple roles in company and previously mentioned boards.

You are a woman who has assumed a top leadership role. What needs to happen to get more women in leadership roles? Women need to believe that they should be heard and then make themselves heard without apology. We can and should learn from each other and from male stakeholders (i.e., men who are grandfathers, fathers, uncles, or brothers to females). If we are to be effective mentors, we need to create a dialogue that resonates with the next gens (we can't guilt them, or lecture them, but we can learn their challenges and help them carve their own paths). I'd like to see more men and women help more women. Parents should teach their male and female children the true meaning and impact of equality and parity.
The best advice you've ever received: Three top favorites: "Create multiple options for yourself and exercise them as needed" (from my dad when I was 14, and it has kept me calm about my future); "Complain if you will, but pair it with a solution" (from my first boss at 16 and it became my practice and expectation from those working with me); "For innovations, prove failure first and fast; if you can't make them fail you have proven them a success" (from a very wise and successful VC and it has become my mantra).
Your best advice for others: Keep an open mind and heart, see things through a fair lens, and share them with others.
Something about you that would surprise others: I would like to build tiny home communities in safe zones for the elderly, the homeless and the under-represented.
What motivates you to get out of bed in the morning? I strive to teach my son (soon 17) a strong work ethic by example — not that I want him to work my hours. But since I work my hours, I also want to teach him that you have to like your work and the people you work with so you can do well and enjoy it along the way.
Who is your hero/mentor? Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal comes to mind simply because he recently articulated in an order why certain behaviors by men towards women are not acceptable in his courtroom or elsewhere. Coming from a man, a judge, a respected person is impactful.
What has been your biggest challenge professionally? Dealing with lazy, arrogant or overly confident professionals.
Current civic/community involvement: My family.
Guilty pleasure: Being quiet.




 


Your favorite gadget: My son's turntable for playing vinyl records again.
The number of years you have been in your line of work: 28
What would you like to accomplish in the next year? Undertake a new leadership role in technology with a continued emphasis on innovation, the entrepreneurial spirit, and product development for the forgotten or under-represented (e.g., senior citizens, homeless, disabled, veterans).
If you weren't doing what you do now, what would it be? A medical doctor.
How do you unwind? Stare at the stars in the night sky.
How many hours a week do you average at work? 60+
What are you concerned about? Maintaining a level of excellence in everything I undertake, including family.

Where were you born? Portland
What was your first job? Waiting tables at my parents’ tiny Chinese restaurant.
Growing up, you wanted to be: Good at whatever I did.




Employees: Under 20
Career path: I started in a hospital pharmacy, attended law school and became a registered patent attorney. I was a patent prosecution associate, then a big firm patent litigation associate, then chief IP cCounsel for a public high tech company (and later became its vice president for global affairs), then took a brief hiatus to spend quality time with my family. Returned to practice as a consultant, then as a co-managing partner at a small patent boutique, then general counsel for a VC-backed startup, then interim general counsel for two software companies, then joined Finjan as vice president, legal, which lead to current multiple roles in company and previously mentioned boards.

You are a woman who has assumed a top leadership role. What needs to happen to get more women in leadership roles? Women need to believe that they should be heard and then make themselves heard without apology. We can and should learn from each other and from male stakeholders (i.e., men who are grandfathers, fathers, uncles, or brothers to females). If we are to be effective mentors, we need to create a dialogue that resonates with the next gens (we can't guilt them, or lecture them, but we can learn their challenges and help them carve their own paths). I'd like to see more men and women help more women. Parents should teach their male and female children the true meaning and impact of equality and parity.
The best advice you've ever received: Three top favorites: "Create multiple options for yourself and exercise them as needed" (from my dad when I was 14, and it has kept me calm about my future); "Complain if you will, but pair it with a solution" (from my first boss at 16 and it became my practice and expectation from those working with me); "For innovations, prove failure first and fast; if you can't make them fail you have proven them a success" (from a very wise and successful VC and it has become my mantra).
Your best advice for others: Keep an open mind and heart, see things through a fair lens, and share them with others.
Something about you that would surprise others: I would like to build tiny home communities in safe zones for the elderly, the homeless and the under-represented.
What motivates you to get out of bed in the morning? I strive to teach my son (soon 17) a strong work ethic by example — not that I want him to work my hours. But since I work my hours, I also want to teach him that you have to like your work and the people you work with so you can do well and enjoy it along the way.
Who is your hero/mentor? Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal comes to mind simply because he recently articulated in an order why certain behaviors by men towards women are not acceptable in his courtroom or elsewhere. Coming from a man, a judge, a respected person is impactful.
What has been your biggest challenge professionally? Dealing with lazy, arrogant or overly confident professionals.
Current civic/community involvement: My family.
Guilty pleasure: Being quiet.




 


Your favorite gadget: My son's turntable for playing vinyl records again.
The number of years you have been in your line of work: 28
What would you like to accomplish in the next year? Undertake a new leadership role in technology with a continued emphasis on innovation, the entrepreneurial spirit, and product development for the forgotten or under-represented (e.g., senior citizens, homeless, disabled, veterans).
If you weren't doing what you do now, what would it be? A medical doctor.
How do you unwind? Stare at the stars in the night sky.
How many hours a week do you average at work? 60+
What are you concerned about? Maintaining a level of excellence in everything I undertake, including family.
