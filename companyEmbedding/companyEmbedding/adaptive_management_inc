A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

About Us

Adaptive Marketing creates next generation product management and marketing professionals, critical catalysts for the fast growing IT product ecosystem in India. Enabling aspiring, new and existing PM/PMMs with pragmatic methodologies and field tested best practices, is critical as MNCs in India look at augmenting their technical execution with business focus and as Indian products go global.
As the IT product industry adapts to new business models like Software as a Service (SaaS), new route to markets through the Web 2.0 and new customer acquisition paradigms for B2B and B2C segments with social media marketing, we aim to prepare and create the next generation professionals to be ready for the challenge and lead successful business. We envision Adaptive Marketing to be the pioneer service provider in product management and marketing training, consulting and execution services.

Help me DecideAdaptive Workshops can be experienced in 3 different  ways - 
 Public (In Person)  These workshops happen across the world at a predetermined schedule and is open for senior professionals across industry and across companies as long as they pass the eligibility criteria.  Facilitator and participants are all in the same physical location for the duration of the workshop and physical proximity creates a rich experiential learning environment. Public (Hybrid Learning)    These programs are conducted live over an Interactive Learning Platform(ILT) which allows the participants to attend at a location of their convenience and are usually time spaced for better assimilation.

Some hybrid programs also have "immersion" modules where all the participants visit the campus to network and interact with the faculty face to face.
 Private (Onsite)   These workshops are usually conducted for companies internally for their team members in a physical face to face format. Such workshops are usually corporate sponsored for their key leaders and allow for deeper company specific discussions as well as sharper customization to make them tailor made for the challenges for each group.



Public (InPerson)


Peer Learning is emphasized due to the cross pollination of companies and industries
Full spectrum Networking Opportunities







Public (Live Online)


Location convenience
More Assimilation time for the learnings as sessions are usually spaced out







Private (Onsite)


Better content customization for the specific group needs
Discuss and brainstorm company specific process in addition to industry best practices






If you need more details or help in choosing the right format of delivery, feel free to reach out to our "Client Delight" executives on mail to: engage@adaptivemarketing.in

We compensate physicians for providing us with your valuable feedback through surveys and brief questionnaires after interactions with our clients in online appointments scheduled at YOUR convenience.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
