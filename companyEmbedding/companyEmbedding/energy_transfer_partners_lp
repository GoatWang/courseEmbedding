Enterprise Products Prevails In Appeal Against Energy Transfer Partners

 (RTTNews.com) - Enterprise Products Partners L.P. ( EPD ) said that it has prevailed in its appeal against Energy Transfer Partners. This appeal stems from a 2014 Dallas jury verdict in a lawsuit filed by Energy Transfer over a proposed pipeline project that was cancelled due to a lack of customer support. This case has been a long, hard battle and Enterprise is grateful to the Fifth Court of Appeals for their hard work.
In April 2011, Enterprise and Energy Transfer signed a series of agreements disclaiming any partnership or joint venture absent executed definitive documents and board approvals of the two companies. Definitive agreements were never executed and board approval was never obtained. The parties signed these disclaiming agreements precisely to avoid the type of lawsuit brought here.
Enterprise management is grateful that the Dallas Court of Appeals correctly reaffirmed the importance of written contracts. "This case needed decisive action because it had the potential to stand as one of the worst for business in Texas since the Texaco v. Pennzoil decision from the 1980s," said Enterprise appellate lawyer David Keltner.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer is a Texas-based company that began in 1995 as a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator and is now one of the largest and most diversified investment grade master limited partnerships in the United States. Growing from roughly 200 miles of natural gas pipelines in 2002 to more than 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined products, and crude oil pipelines today, the Energy Transfer family of partnerships remains dedicated to providing exceptional service to its customers and attractive returns to its investors.
Through several transformative transactions, we have expanded our scope of services. While we remain committed to the natural gas industry, we enhanced our diversified portfolio of assets by making a strategic entrance into the NGL business through the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus’ NGL storage, fractionation and transportation operations in 2011. In 2012, we acquired Southern Union Company, a leading diversified natural gas company, which expanded our national footprint and added more than 20,000 miles of gathering and transportation pipelines to our portfolio. We made a strong entrance into the crude oil and refined products business by acquiring Sunoco, Inc. in 2012, including its interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. 
(NYSE: SXL). Lastly, through the merger with Regency Energy Partners in 2015, we significantly diversified our footprint, both geographically and across business lines. We expanded our reach in the refined products and convenience store business with the acquisition of Susser Holdings Corporation, including its interest in Susser Petroleum Partners LP, 
(now Sunoco LP - NYSE: SUN). In April 2017, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners merged, with the combined company now called Energy Transfer Partners, creating one of the largest MLPs by Enterprise Value with a fully integrated midstream/liquids platform. These acquisitions, together with our already robust asset base, have enabled Energy Transfer to become a premier provider of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and refined products.
Today, there are four publicly traded partnerships in the Energy Transfer Family.

Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETP) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. Strategically positioned in all of the major U.S. production basins, ETP owns and operates a geographically diverse portfolio of complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets; crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and refined product transportation and terminalling assets; NGL fractionation; and various acquisition and marketing assets.  ETP’s general partner is owned by Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETE).
 For more information, visit the Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. website at

Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 
(NYSE: ETE) is a master limited partnership that owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
(NYSE: ETP) and Sunoco LP 
(NYSE: SUN).  ETE also owns Lake Charles LNG Company. On a consolidated basis, ETE's family of companies owns and operates a diverse portfolio of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil pipelines, as well as retail and wholesale motor fuel operations and LNG terminalling.

MIDSTREAM
The midstream natural gas industry is the link between the exploration and production of natural gas and the delivery of its components to end-use markets. The midstream industry consists of natural gas gathering, compression, treating, processing, storage, and transportation, and is generally characterized by regional competition based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing plants to natural gas producing wells and the proximity of storage facilities to production areas and end-use markets.
Through our midstream segment, we own and operate approximately 35,000 miles of in service natural gas, 33 natural gas processing plants, 22 natural gas treating facilities and 4 natural gas conditioning facilities with an aggregate processing, treating and conditioning capacity of approximately 10.1 Bcf/d.  Our midstream segment focuses on the gathering, compression, treating, blending, and processing, and our operations are currently concentrated in major producing basins and shales, including the Austin Chalk trend and Eagle Ford Shale in South and Southeast Texas, the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the Barnett Shale and Woodford Shale in North Texas, the Bossier Sands in East Texas, the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the Haynesville Shale in East Texas and Louisiana.  Many of our midstream assets are integrated with our intrastate transportation and storage assets.
Our midstream segment also includes a 60% interest in ELG, which operates natural gas gathering, oil pipeline, and oil stabilization facilities in South Texas, a 33.33% membership interest in Ranch Westex JV LLC, which processes natural gas delivered from the NGLs-rich shale formations in West Texas, a 75% membership interest in ORS, which operates a natural gas gathering system in the Utica shale in Ohio, and a 50% interest in Mi Vida JV, which operates a cryogenic processing plant and related facilities in West Texas, a 51% membership interest in Aqua – PVR, which transports and supplies fresh water to natural gas producers in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania, and a 50% interest in Sweeny Gathering LP, which operates a natural gas gathering facility in South Texas.
Our midstream segment results are derived primarily from margins we earn for natural gas volumes that are gathered, transported, purchased and sold through our pipeline systems and the natural gas and NGL volumes processed at our processing and treating facilities.
The following details our assets in the midstream segment.


 

Southeast Texas System

 Approximately 7,100 miles of natural gas pipeline
 One natural gas processing plant (La Grange) with aggregate capacity of 210 MMcf/d
 10 natural gas treating facilities with aggregate capacity of 1.2 Bcf/d
 One natural gas conditioning facility with aggregate capacity of 200 MMcf/d
                
The Southeast Texas System is an integrated system that gathers, compresses, treats, processes and transports natural gas from the Austin Chalk trend. The Southeast Texas System is a large natural gas gathering system covering thirteen counties between Austin and Houston. This system is connected to the Katy Hub through the East Texas pipeline and is connected to the Oasis pipeline, as well as two power plants. This allows us to bypass our processing plants and treating facilities when processing margins are unfavorable by blending untreated natural gas from the Southeast Texas System with natural gas on the Oasis pipeline while continuing to meet pipeline quality specifications.
The La Grange processing plant is a natural gas processing plant that processes the rich natural gas that flows through our system to produce residue gas and NGLs.  Residue gas is delivered into our intrastate pipelines and NGLs are delivered into our NGL pipelines and then to Lone Star.
Our treating facilities remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas gathered into our system before the natural gas is introduced to transportation pipelines to ensure that the gas meets pipeline quality specifications. In addition, our conditioning facilities remove heavy hydrocarbons from the gas gathered into our systems so the gas can be redelivered and meet downstream pipeline hydrocarbon dew point specifications.






 

North Texas System

 Approximately 160 miles of natural gas pipeline
 One natural gas processing plant (the Godley plant) with aggregate capacity of 700 MMcf/d
 One natural gas conditioning facility with capacity of 100 MMcf/d 
                
The North Texas System is an integrated system located in four counties in North Texas that gathers, compresses, treats, processes and transports natural gas from the Barnett and Woodford Shales.  The system includes our Godley processing plant, which processes rich natural gas produced from the Barnett Shale and is integrated with the North Texas System and the ET Fuel System.  The facility consists of a processing plant and a conditioning facility.






 

Northern Louisiana

 Approximately 280 miles of natural gas pipeline
 Three natural gas treating facilities with aggregate capacity of 385 MMcf/d
                
Our Northern Louisiana assets comprise several gathering systems in the Haynesville Shale with access to multiple markets through interconnects with several pipelines, including our Tiger pipeline.  Our Northern Louisiana assets include the Bistineau, Creedence, and Tristate Systems.






 

Eagle Ford System

 Approximately 1,090 miles of natural gas pipeline
 Four processing plants (Chisholm, Kenedy, Jackson and King Ranch) with capacity of 1,940 MMcf/d
 One natural gas treating facility with capacity of 300 MMcf/d
                
The Eagle Ford gathering system consists of 30-inch and 42-inch natural gas transportation pipelines delivering 1.4 Bcf/d of capacity originating in Dimmitt County, Texas and extending to our Chisholm pipeline for ultimate deliveries to our existing processing plants.  Our Chisholm, Kenedy and Jackson processing plants are connected to our intrastate transportation pipeline systems for deliveries of residue gas and are also connected with our NGL pipelines for delivery of NGLs to Lone Star.






 

Arklatex System

 Approximately 2,800 miles of natural gas pipeline
 Three natural gas processing facilities (Dubach, Dubberly  and Brookeland) with aggregate capacity of 510 MMcf/d
 Two natural gas treating facilities
 One conditioning facility
                
The Arklatex assets gather, compress, treat and dehydrate natural gas in several Parishes of north and West Louisiana and several counties in East Texas.  These assets also include cryogenic natural gas processing facilities, a refrigeration plant, a conditioning plant, amine treating plants, and an interstate NGL pipeline.
Through the gathering and processing systems described above and their interconnections with RIGS in north Louisiana, we offer producers wellhead-to-market services, including natural gas gathering, compression, processing, treating and transportation.






 

South Texas System

 Approximately 1,300 miles of natural gas pipeline
 Three natural gas treating facilities with aggregate capacity of 335 MMcf/d
                
The South Texas assets gather, compress, treat and dehydrate natural gas in Bee, LaSalle, Webb, Karnes, Atascosa, McMullen, Frio and Dimmitt counties.  The pipeline systems are connected to third-party processing plants and treating facilities that include acid gas reinjection wells located in McMullen County, Texas.  We also gather oil for producers in the region and deliver it to tanks for further transportation by truck or pipeline.
The natural gas supply for the south Texas gathering systems is derived from a combination of natural gas wells located in a mature basin that generally have long lives and predictable gas flow rates, including the Frio, Vicksburg, Miocene, Canyon Sands and Wilcox formations, and the NGLs-rich and oil-rich Eagle Ford shale formation.
We own a 60% interest in ELG with Talisman Energy USA Inc. and Statoil Texas Onshore Properties LP owning the remaining 40% interest.  We operate a natural gas gathering oil pipeline and oil stabilization facilities for the joint venture while our joint venture partners operate a lean gas gathering system in the Edwards Lime natural gas trend that delivers to this system.






 

Permian System

 Approximately 7,820 miles of natural gas pipeline
 8 processing facilities (Waha, Coyanosa, Red Bluff, Halley, Jal, Keyston, Tippet and Rebel) with aggregate capacity of 995 MMcf/d
 Two treating facilities with aggregate capacity of 200 MMcf/d
                
The Permian Basin gathering system assets offer wellhead-to-market services to producers in the Texas counties of Ward, Winkler, Reeves, Pecos, Crocket, Upton, Crane, Ector, Culberson, Reagan and Andrews counties, as well as into Eddy and Lea counties in New Mexico which surround the Waha Hub, one of Texas’s developing NGLs-rich natural gas market areas.  As a result of the proximity of our system to the Waha Hub, the Waha gathering system has a variety of market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process, including several major interstate and intrastate pipelines serving California, the mid-continent region of the United States and Texas natural gas markets.  The NGL market outlets include Lone Star’s NGL pipeline.
During 2015, Regency completed construction on a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant on behalf of Mi Vida JV, a joint venture in which we own a 50% membership interest.  We operate the plant and related facilities on behalf of Mi Vida JV.
We own a 33.33% membership interest in Ranch JV which processes natural gas delivered from the NGLs-rich Bone Spring and Avalon shale formations in West Texas. The joint venture owns a 25 MMcf/d refrigeration plant and a 100 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant.






 

Mid-Continent Region

 Approximately 13,500 miles of natural gas pipeline
 15 natural gas processing facilities (Mocane, Beaver, Antelope Hills, Woodall, Wheeler, Sunray, Hemphill, Phoenix, Crescent, Hamlin, Spearman, Red Deer, Lefors, Cargray and Gray) with aggregate capacity of 910 MMcf/d
 One natural gas treating facilities with aggregate capacity of 20 MMcf/d
                
The mid-continent systems are located in two large natural gas producing regions in the United States, the Hugoton Basin in southwest Kansas, and the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.  These mature basins have continued to provide generally long-lived, predictable production volume.  Our mid-continent gathering assets are extensive systems that gather, compress and dehydrate low-pressure gas. We have 15 natural gas producing facilities and approximately 13,500 miles of gathering pipeline.
We operate our mid-continent gathering systems at low pressures to maximize the total throughput volumes from the connected wells.  Wellhead pressures are therefore adequate to allow for flow of natural gas into the gathering lines without the cost of wellhead compression.
We also own the Hugoton gathering system that has 1,900 miles of pipeline extending over nine counties in Kansas and Oklahoma.  This system is operated by a third party.






 

Eastern Region

 Approximately 500 miles of natural gas pipeline
                
The eastern region assets are located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and gather natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica basins.  Our eastern gathering assets include approximately 500 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline, natural gas trunkline pipelines, and fresh water pipelines, and the Lycoming, Wyoming, East Lycoming, Bradford, Green County, and Preston gathering and processing systems. 
We also own a 51% membership interest in Aqua – PVR, a joint venture that transports and supplies fresh water to natural gas producers drilling in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.
We and Traverse ORS LLC, a subsidiary of Traverse Midstream Partners LLC, own a 75% and 25% membership interest, respectively, in the ORS joint venture.  On behalf of ORS, we constructed and are operating its Ohio Utica River System, (the “ORS System”) which was completed in 2015 and consists of a 52-mile, 36-inch gathering trunkline that will be capable of delivering up to 2.1 Bcf/d to Rockies Express Pipeline (“REX”) and Texas Eastern Transmission, and potentially others and the construction of 25,000 horsepower of compression at the REX interconnect.  This project also included the construction of a 12-mile, 30-inch lateral that connected to the tailgate of the Cadiz processing plant and Harrison County wellhead production.






 

Other Midstream Assets
The midstream segment also includes our interests in various midstream assets located in Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana, with approximately 60 miles of gathering pipelines aggregating a combined capacity of approximately 115 MMcf/d, as well as one conditioning facility and our Rebel processing plant with capacity of 180 MMcf/d.  We also own approximately 27 miles of gathering pipelines serving the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia with aggregate capacity of approximately 250 MMcf/d.

Overview[edit]
ETE is a master limited partnership, which owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.(ETP) and about 50.2 million ETP limited partner units; it owns the general partner and 100% of the IDRs of Regency Energy Partners LP and about 26.3 million RGP limited partner units. ETE also owns a non-controlling interest in a corporation (ETP Holdco Corporation) that owns Southern Union Company and Sunoco, Inc. The ETE family of companies owns approximately 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude pipelines. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. is the parent company of Dakota Access, LLC, the company developing the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[5][6][11][12][13][14]
ETP holds a 100% interest in Lone Star NGL, a joint venture that owns and operates natural gas liquids storage, fractionation and transportation assets in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.[1] ETP Holdco Corporation also owns Southern Union Company.[1]
In October 2012, Sunoco, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ETP via ETP HoldCo Corporation. It acquired the general partner interests, 100% of the incentive distribution rights, and a 32.4% limited partnership interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., which operates a geographically diverse portfolio of crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminating and crude oil acquisition and marketing assets.[1]
In 2014, ETP acquired Stripes, a chain of 580+ convenience stores in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.[15] The convenience stores and retail portfolio are now branded under Sunoco and Aplus names as of year-end 2015.[1]
In January 2015, ETP acquired its affiliate Regency Energy Partners for around $11 billion.[16]
Dakota Access Pipeline[edit]
Main articles: Bakken pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline protests
Dakota Access, LLC is an ETP subsidiary, tasked with building the Bakken pipeline, also known as the Dakota Access Pipeline.[17] In April 2016, three federal agencies — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Interior, and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation — requested a full Environmental Impact Statement of the pipeline.[18] In July, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed an injunction against the US Army Corps of Engineers to stop building the pipeline.[19][20] A group of young activists from Standing Rock ran from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to present a petition in protest of the construction of the pipeline and launched an international campaign called ReZpect Our Water.[21] Protests have since erupted at a construction site near the Cannonball River in North Dakota, resulting in the arrest of hundreds and the use of force by a private security company, North Dakota State and county police, and the New Mexico National Guard.[22]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  8.90 (07/21/17)      EPS (TTM)  $2.24      Market Cap $21.68 B     Shares Outstanding 1.09 B     Public Float 985.95 M     Yield 10.73% (07/21/17)      Latest Dividend $0.535 (05/15/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 05/08/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (06/30/17)    Shares Sold Short 24.28 M     Change from Last  -4.97%      Percent of Float 2.46%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    2.13      Net Money Flow ($)  18.59 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Overview[edit]
ETE is a master limited partnership, which owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.(ETP) and about 50.2 million ETP limited partner units; it owns the general partner and 100% of the IDRs of Regency Energy Partners LP and about 26.3 million RGP limited partner units. ETE also owns a non-controlling interest in a corporation (ETP Holdco Corporation) that owns Southern Union Company and Sunoco, Inc. The ETE family of companies owns approximately 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude pipelines. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. is the parent company of Dakota Access, LLC, the company developing the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[5][6][11][12][13][14]
ETP holds a 100% interest in Lone Star NGL, a joint venture that owns and operates natural gas liquids storage, fractionation and transportation assets in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.[1] ETP Holdco Corporation also owns Southern Union Company.[1]
In October 2012, Sunoco, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ETP via ETP HoldCo Corporation. It acquired the general partner interests, 100% of the incentive distribution rights, and a 32.4% limited partnership interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., which operates a geographically diverse portfolio of crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminating and crude oil acquisition and marketing assets.[1]
In 2014, ETP acquired Stripes, a chain of 580+ convenience stores in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.[15] The convenience stores and retail portfolio are now branded under Sunoco and Aplus names as of year-end 2015.[1]
In January 2015, ETP acquired its affiliate Regency Energy Partners for around $11 billion.[16]
Dakota Access Pipeline[edit]
Main articles: Bakken pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline protests
Dakota Access, LLC is an ETP subsidiary, tasked with building the Bakken pipeline, also known as the Dakota Access Pipeline.[17] In April 2016, three federal agencies — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Interior, and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation — requested a full Environmental Impact Statement of the pipeline.[18] In July, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed an injunction against the US Army Corps of Engineers to stop building the pipeline.[19][20] A group of young activists from Standing Rock ran from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to present a petition in protest of the construction of the pipeline and launched an international campaign called ReZpect Our Water.[21] Protests have since erupted at a construction site near the Cannonball River in North Dakota, resulting in the arrest of hundreds and the use of force by a private security company, North Dakota State and county police, and the New Mexico National Guard.[22]

Overview[edit]
ETE is a master limited partnership, which owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.(ETP) and about 50.2 million ETP limited partner units; it owns the general partner and 100% of the IDRs of Regency Energy Partners LP and about 26.3 million RGP limited partner units. ETE also owns a non-controlling interest in a corporation (ETP Holdco Corporation) that owns Southern Union Company and Sunoco, Inc. The ETE family of companies owns approximately 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude pipelines. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. is the parent company of Dakota Access, LLC, the company developing the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[5][6][11][12][13][14]
ETP holds a 100% interest in Lone Star NGL, a joint venture that owns and operates natural gas liquids storage, fractionation and transportation assets in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.[1] ETP Holdco Corporation also owns Southern Union Company.[1]
In October 2012, Sunoco, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ETP via ETP HoldCo Corporation. It acquired the general partner interests, 100% of the incentive distribution rights, and a 32.4% limited partnership interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., which operates a geographically diverse portfolio of crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminating and crude oil acquisition and marketing assets.[1]
In 2014, ETP acquired Stripes, a chain of 580+ convenience stores in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.[15] The convenience stores and retail portfolio are now branded under Sunoco and Aplus names as of year-end 2015.[1]
In January 2015, ETP acquired its affiliate Regency Energy Partners for around $11 billion.[16]
Dakota Access Pipeline[edit]
Main articles: Bakken pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline protests
Dakota Access, LLC is an ETP subsidiary, tasked with building the Bakken pipeline, also known as the Dakota Access Pipeline.[17] In April 2016, three federal agencies — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Interior, and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation — requested a full Environmental Impact Statement of the pipeline.[18] In July, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed an injunction against the US Army Corps of Engineers to stop building the pipeline.[19][20] A group of young activists from Standing Rock ran from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to present a petition in protest of the construction of the pipeline and launched an international campaign called ReZpect Our Water.[21] Protests have since erupted at a construction site near the Cannonball River in North Dakota, resulting in the arrest of hundreds and the use of force by a private security company, North Dakota State and county police, and the New Mexico National Guard.[22]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
