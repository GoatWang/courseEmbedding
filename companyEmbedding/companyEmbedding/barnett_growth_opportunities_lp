“I really noticed my hair loss when I definitely turned 25 and it was kind of funny, I did start to laugh, like, ‘Hey, I really am losing my hair.’
Then it really got serious, so I really started to look and research different places that could help me out, and all the roads led me to Bosley, which I’m very pleased about.”
– Jared H.




HAIR LOSS TREATMENT OPTIONS
There are two main types of hair loss treatment options—surgical and non-surgical.  Non-surgical hair loss treatments include options like Propecia or Lasercomb. Surgical hair restoration can be performed by a Bosley physician as either a follicular unit transfer (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE) hair restoration.
For those suffering from hereditary hair loss, there is unfortunately no hair loss cure. In such cases, medication like Propecia, Rogaine and even the Lasercomb may help to slow down the progression of hair thinning and baldness. For early stages of hair thinning, these hair loss solutions can help regrow some hair, but they will not fully restore the hair and hairline that have been lost.
The only proven, permanent solution to genetic hair loss is hair transplantation. It works by surgically restoring hair from the donor area to the recipient (thinning) area.
While surgical hair transplantation is the only permanent and the most significant receding hairline treatment, these other hair loss solutions can help in your fight against hair loss.

SURGICAL HAIR TRANSPLANTATION
Surgical hair transplantation involves transplanting hair follicles from one area of the head (called the donor area) to another (the recipient area). Most causes of hair loss may be traced to the hormone DHT. In hair transplantation, DHT-resistant follicles are removed from the scalp and artfully placed in thinning areas on the top and front of the head. Our patients find there are many benefits of hair transplantation over other treatment options. You may also wish to see the steps involved in a Bosley hair replacement procedure.


FOLLICULAR UNIT EXTRACTION
The Bosley Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) is a minimally invasive hair transplantation technique in which follicular unit grafts (hair follicles) are individually removed from the patient’s donor area and then individually transplanted to the recipient (thinning) area.
The grafts are removed using a precision tool and then placed in the recipient area. There is no linear scar and no stitches are required, so your donor area will be minimally noticeable within just a few days.


BOSLEY LASERCOMB® ELITE
The Bosley LaserComb® Elite is the only FDA-approved medical device that emits controlled laser energy to stimulate hair follicles and promote re-growth. Although the LaserComb is not a hair loss cure, it is an ideal treatment for individuals with very early-stage hair loss where hair restoration surgery is not indicated. Although it is not intended to treat advanced hair loss, the Bosley LaserComb® Elite may be used either on pre-operative and/or post-operative patients to improve the results of hair restoration surgery. You can purchase the Bosley LaserComb® Elite online from the Bosley Store.


THERADOME™ LASER HELMET
The Theradome™ Laser Helmet is an over-the-counter FDA cleared wearable clinical-strength therapy device for the treatment of hair-loss. It is non-invasive, and is intended for use in the privacy and convenience of one’s own home. The Theradome™ Laser Helmet uses Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) as an effective treatment in hair loss, and has been proven to slow down and stop hair loss, to strengthen hair by doubling follicle size and to regrow new, healthy hair via cellular rejuvenation. Read more on the Theradome Laser Helmet.


BOSLEY HAIRMAX LASER BAND
Stimulating hair growth has never been easier, faster or more sophisticated. Featuring 82 medical grade lasers, the HairMax LaserBand provides a super-fast 90 second treatment. The LaserBand’s unique curved design and exclusive hair parting teeth provide optimal delivery of nourishing laser light to energize your hair follicles and regrow your hair!


BOSLEY PROFESSIONAL STRENGTH
Bosley Professional Strength is a complete system to help prevent hair loss and restore thinning hair – in 5 simple daily steps. Offered in Men’s and Women’s formulations, Bosley Professional Strength contains ingredients that nourish and invigorate the scalp and hair, creating the perfect environment for the growth of thick, healthy hair. Bosley Professional Strength for Men, including the FDA approved 5% Minoxidil solution, comes in a complete 6-month treatment kit and is available only through your Bosley counselor. Significant growth typically occurs in 4-6 months, and consistent compliance is required to maintain the most positive results.


PRESCRIPTION PROPECIA®
Propecia® is an FDA-approved tablet taken once a day, available by prescription only. Propecia works to inhibit the formation of the DHT hormone that weakens hair and halts its growth. Propecia is not a balding cure, and is not approved for use by women. Propecia must be taken on an on-going basis to maintain its benefit. You can get more information on Propecia during a Bosley consultation.

Legend Natural Gas IV, LP Closes on $900 Million Barnett Shale Acquisition

		  Three Legend Partnerships Merged into One Holding Company
		

May 02, 2011, 09:24 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Riverstone Holdings LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, May 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The Legend Natural Gas partnerships (composed of Legend Natural Gas II, LP, Legend Natural Gas III, LP and Legend Natural Gas IV, LP, collectively referred to as "Legend"), along with their equity sponsor Riverstone Holdings LLC ("Riverstone"), today announced the execution of several transactions which will significantly increase reserves and production, improve operational and administrative efficiencies and position Legend for future growth. 
Chief among the transactions: 
The three existing Legend partnerships were contributed into a new holding company called Legend Production Holdings, LLC ("Legend Production"). Immediately following the contribution, Legend closed on its previously announced purchase of a subsidiary of Range Resources Corporation's ("Range") Barnett Shale assets in the Fort Worth Basin for $900 million. Legend Production, together with its affiliated partnerships, closed a $1.5 billion senior secured revolving facility which, along with additional contributed equity, funded the Range acquisition as well as future growth opportunities. The credit facility was funded by a syndication of banks led by Wells Fargo Securities and J.P. Morgan Chase. The Barnett assets acquired from Range include 390 producing wells and approximately 52,000 net acres, 80% of which are located in the prolific core area of the Barnett trend. Daily net production from the properties was 113 Mmcfe per day (86% gas) as of February 1, 2011, the effective date of the purchase. The acquisition marks Legend's entry into the horizontal Barnett Shale resource play, making it the fifth largest producer in the play. Legend is the operator of the newly acquired properties.
The Range acquisition follows the recent acquisition of conventional South Texas Vicksburg production from a subsidiary of Smith Production Company, which closed on March 31, 2011 for $99.2 million. Effective January 1, 2011, Legend acquired a majority interest in the Samano and Santa Fe Fields located in Starr, Brooks and Hidalgo Counties, Texas. The properties include 103 wells producing approximately 9 Mmcfe per day net (65% gas) on 7,200 net acres. Legend is the operator of the newly acquired properties.
As a result of the Range and Smith acquisitions and the combination of the partnerships, Legend Production has become a significant oil and natural gas company with a large presence in some of the most desirable oil and natural gas regions in the United States. Legend expects the combined entity to have average daily net production of approximately 200 Mmcfe per day in 2011. The combination will also create a more efficient and flexible operating structure. 
Legend Production now owns an interest in approximately 800 operated, producing wells located in three core areas: the Fort Worth Basin, the Permian Basin and South Texas. Legend Production expects to increase production through efficient development of its proved reserve base, disciplined exploration, and strategic acquisitions. Legend Production is currently exploring and developing its acreage position in the emerging Bone Spring/Avalon/Wolfcamp shale plays of the Delaware Basin in New Mexico and West Texas.
Equity for all of the Legend partnerships is provided by the Riverstone/Carlyle Global Energy and Power Funds, a group of energy-focused private equity funds managed by Riverstone Holdings LLC.
About Legend Production Holdings, LLC
Legend Production Holdings, LLC is a holding company composed of Legend Natural Gas II, LP, Legend Natural Gas III, LP and Legend Natural Gas IV, LP.  Legend Production is headquartered in Houston and is focused on acquiring and developing long-lived oil and natural gas properties primarily in prolific basins around Texas, including areas of South Texas, the Fort Worth Basin (Barnett Shale) and the Permian Basin. The first Legend partnership, Legend Natural Gas, LP, was formed in 2001 by James A. Winne III and Michael Becci, serving as President and CEO and Vice President and CFO, respectively.  It was the first  portfolio company funded by Riverstone/Carlyle Global Energy and Power Funds in the exploration and production sector.  The partnership acquired and developed producing properties in South Texas until the sale of its assets to Chesapeake Energy in 2004.  Legend Natural Gas II, LP was then formed in 2004 followed by the formation of Legend Natural Gas III, LP in 2006 and Legend Natural Gas IV, LP in 2009. These Legend partnerships continue today as Legend Production under the same experienced management team led by James A. Winne III and Michael Becci.  The relationship between Legend and Riverstone is the longest of any Riverstone portfolio company.  Riverstone has invested $1 billion in upstream assets through the various Legend partnerships.

Barnett Showing Some Gray Yet Still Providing Opportunity
Jul 18, 2012 | Announcements, Barnett, Drilling Costs, Geology, Operators, Uncategorized | 0 comments
 

Operators staying true to the play believe the Barnett will hold out another 10 to 20 years.  The rig count has dropped by almost half over the past year, but that’s indicative of low natural gas prices.  Here’s a look at the latest rig count in the Fort Worth Basin.  Chart includes 5 vertical rigs.


Those with good acreage positions in the Barnett Shale Combo; the play offers nice liquids revenue growth.  EOG, the largest oil producer in the Barnett, has amassed 215,000 net acres in the core combo area.  A typical well for the company, priced at $3.3 MM, has an EUR of 300 MBOE and around a 40% after tax rate of return.  EOG plans to complete 200 net wells in the play this year.  Pioneer is still increasing production and plans to continue that trend on into 2014.  The company has 80,000 gross acres prospective to the core and is currently running 2 rigs with plans to ramp that up to 4 next year.  Well costs for Pioneer are around $3.5 MM with a 5000 foot lateral and gross EURs of 460 MBOE.  Devon is making the most of their position and plans to drill 300 net wells this year and has reported 30% of production in the play is liquids, including NGLs.  According to Ron Gajdica, SVP Enervest Energy Partners, LP, the combo area has a lower decline rate than the rest of the Barnett.  There is little geologic risk, but uncertainty about what the IPs will bring.
Permitting over the past 3 months shows EOG and Pioneer providing the bulk of the activity in Montague and Wise Counties.
As for the rest of the Barnett, it’s the same old song and tune coming out of the other shale gas plays.  Last year, Range Resources sold their Barnett assets for $900 million to a private company, but holding onto some nonproducing acreage valued at about $50 million.  A couple months ago Chesapeake laid-off roughly 10% of their workforce in the region and has drawn back to 2 rigs, down from 44 rigs in 2008.  Both Carrizo and Quicksilver are in the final stages of reconfiguring their positions by creating MLPs and selling off acreage.  Carrizo sold a portion of their assets to Atlas Resource Partners, a newly formed E&P MLP of Atlas Energy for $190 million, which closed in late April.  Quicksilver, with an inventory of uncompleted wells, has decreased their leasehold to 160,000 acres down from 200,000.

At 30 years of production, the Barnett is debatably middle-aged.  For some it continues to be a significant liquids growth contributor, while others see the play in its twilight.  Stay connected with the Barnett Shale by logging on to Drilling Info’s DNA section.

Devon Energy - Barnett Shale Comments



Devon Energy (DVN) made comments on its operations in the Barnett Shale during the second quarter earnings conference call. The company averaged production of 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2010, just short of its record production of 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. Devon Energy estimates that its production will surpass the previous record during the third quarter of 2010. “Moving to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, we are currently running 17 Devon-operated rigs. But as I mentioned, we'll be moving one of these rigs to the Granite Wash later this month. But we plan to run the remaining 16 rigs in the Barnett for the rest of 2010. We continue to be very selective with our Barnett drilling, focusing our activity in the liquids-rich areas.” “Our net production in the Barnett exceeded 1.1 Bcf equivalent per day, including 39,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate. Although hidden by the rounding, the second quarter daily rate was up 3% from the first quarter. We continue to expect our Barnett production to reach our previous record production of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day during the third quarter.” Source

Barnett Inc. is a worldwide provider of plumbing, electrical, and hardware products distributing its goods to professional contractors, independent hardware stores, and maintenance managers. Through its six distinct comprehensive catalogs, and its wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Lock Corporation, Barnett sells more than 12,000 brand name and private label brands, including Barnett (electrical), ProPlus (plumbing), Premier (plumbing and electrical), and Legend (hardware) to approximately 72,700 total active customers. The sales are supported by a nationwide network of 37 distribution centers and a sophisticated telemarketing staff of more than 100 people. The company’s products are produced by more than 400 suppliers worldwide.
Tubes and Valves in the Beginning
The business was founded as a catalog distributor in 1958 by the Barnett family in Jacksonville, Florida. In the beginning the company was known as Barnett Tube Fitting and Valve Company and it supplied copper tubing to its customers. At that time Barnett served a specific market niche but as time passed, the family recognized the increased need for a wider variety of plumbing supplies and fixtures. As the company diversified over the years, they changed its name as well; in 1972 the company became known as Barnett Brass & Copper Inc.
As the number of products it offered grew, Barnett developed a business plan that included regional distribution centers so that customers could get faster turnaround on their orders. To be competitive, Barnett realized that a quick response time to their customers’ needs would be critical. Waiting for parts or plumbing supplies meant holdups and cost excesses during construction. Consequently, in 1978 Barnett built its first remote distribution center, with more in the planning stages.
The Waxman Connection: The Mid-1980s Through Mid-1990s
In 1984 Barnett Brass & Copper, Inc. was purchased by Waxman Industries, Inc., a building supplies company, for $12.5 million. The acquisition brought Waxman new distribution outlets, such as hardware cooperatives and supermarkets, and allowed it to enter the mail-order market. Barnett’s mail-order products line doubled when it added Waxman products to its offerings. By 1989 Barnett reached the $50 million mark in sales and had expanded its national distribution center network to ten warehouses. In 1993 Waxman formed Barnett Inc. to take the company public, but held out on the initial public offering (IPO) until 1996. Barnett immediately expanded its operations by introducing its second catalog for maintenance professionals, an offering of more than 7,000 products, and further expanded its distribution center network, which now numbered 25 warehouses.
In 1995 Barnett Inc. reached $100 million in sales for the first time and, in addition to its professional and maintenance catalogs, introduced a third catalog directed to its hardware customers. Numbers of products sold by the company were increasing rapidly and sales were reflecting a solid base of committed customers. In April 1996 Barnett Inc. completed its IPO, marking the start of a new era for the growing company. For the five years prior to the IPO, the company had experienced a 15 percent yearly growth. After its IPO, Barnett managed to nearly double its catalog mailings from 2.5 million to 
4.5 million, resulting in a growth of its customer base from 13,000 to nearly 51,000 in just one year. This turned out to be only the beginning for Barnett.
Acquisitions and Growth in the Mid-1990s
In 1997 Barnett Inc. purchased LeRan Gas Products from Waxman Industries. LeRan was a direct marketer of liquid propane gas products. In the same year the company added warehouse locations in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, bringing the number of warehouse outlets to 32. In 1997 Barnett also added 1,800 new items to its product line, hired more telesales support staff, and stepped up its mailings from 2.5 million flyers in 1996 to 4.5 million in 1997. The company’s success did not go without notice. On November 3, 1997 Forbes magazine ranked Barnett as 60th in its list of the “Top 200 Best Small Companies in America.” The following spring, the magazine Catalog Age listed Barnett as one of the “100 Largest Business-to-Business Companies in the Nation.” CEO William R. Pray attributed Barnett’s success to the talent and dedication of its employees and to a simple strategy: “All the expansion is from our cash flow. We have no debt.”
By 1998 Barnett boasted a customer base of 65,000 customers and Pray had aggressive goals of increasing the number of its mailings to seven million. Barnett also was making plans to expand dramatically into such new markets as hotels, hospitals, and schools. Effective telesales had proven to be an important aspect of Barnett’s strategy. All of its telesalespersons were required to go through extensive product and skills training over a period of several months and then were assigned a specific customer database with whom to develop positive service-oriented relationships. This, coupled with Barnett’s distribution center network, gave it the ability to respond personally and quickly to every customer need. The commitment to customer service resulted in a high customer retention rate of 84 percent for Barnett as compared with the 65 percent overall average in the direct mail industry.


The year 1998 proved to be the strongest ever for Barnett as it positioned itself for future growth. It moved into its new 39,000-square-foot international headquarters and call center on Jacksonville, Florida’s west side in the LaVilla district. Barnett also expanded product lines by ten percent and recorded a net sales gain of 24.7 percent. By this time the company had a product line of more than 11,900 items being distributed to countries throughout North America, South America, and the Caribbean. “Barnett is a highly energetic, highly focused company,” said Jeffrey Germanotta, an analyst with Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. In 1998 he forecasted Barnett’s earnings to rise from 87 cents a share to $1.10 in fiscal 1999 and $1.37 in fiscal 2000.
For the Home and the World: 1998 and Beyond
Barnett entered into a strategic alliance with the Hechinger Company, a leading retailer of products and services in the care, repair, remodeling, and maintenance of the home and garden. In 1998 Hechinger operated more than 200 stores under the names of Hechinger, Home Quarters Warehouse, and Builder’s Square. With the combined catalog and telemarketing strength of Barnett and the outside sales force of Hechinger, customers would experience a full line of products along with next day delivery service to nearly 95 percent of the U.S. market.
By year’s end 1998, Barnett also purchased all of the assets of U.S. Lock from Waxman Industries, Inc. for approximately $33 million. U.S. Lock was a leading distributor of security hardware to locksmiths and other security hardware installers, distributing more than 8,500 national brand name and private label products through its telesales operations, catalogs, and monthly promotional flyers throughout the United States. At the time of the acquisition, William Pray stated: “We believe the acquisition of U.S. Lock is a good strategic fit for Barnett, combining two direct mail, telesales businesses that have similar business models. We are excited about the opportunity to fortify U.S. Lock’s solid growth strategies. With the continued leadership of Michael Gene Merber as President of U.S. Lock, together with his strong management team and infrastructure currently in place, we believe U.S. Lock is competitively positioned for continued sales and profit growth. This transaction will be a credit to our earnings and there are many synergistic opportunities for the businesses.”
Success would not be limited to the home front, however. Barnett began to broaden its business plan and expand overseas. In 1997 international sales were at six percent. By 1998 the company saw an increase in worldwide sales to ten percent of its business.
As the millennium came to a close, Barnett was stronger than ever. Net sales for the nine months that ended March 31, 1999 totaled $174.4 million compared with $148.0 million in the prior year period, an increase of 17.8 percent. The company’s net income totaled $11.3 million, an increase of 8.9 percent over the same period the previous year.
Company Perspectives
Barnett has maintained its high level of success by adhering to its unique and proven marketing formula, and creating an entrepreneurial atmosphere in which its management and employees continue to thrive. We intend to pursue our strategy aggressively and we are confident that it will lead Barnett to continued success and to increased value for our stockholders.
Commenting on the company’s progress, Pray said, “The third quarter of our fiscal year generated a very impressive revenue increase in excess of 29 percent and once again reached record levels, however, our revenue growth did not meet our expectations. A slower than anticipated rate of new product introductions in the quarter, coupled with a disappointing rollout of the Hechinger program were the primary reasons for our lower than expected performance. We are very encouraged by our internal growth rate versus our core growth rate indicating that we are getting increased market share. Our U.S. Lock subsidiary performance was very impressive and met our expectations.”
During 1999 Barnett also had plans to add about 2,000 new products to its line and continue expansion overseas. The company also was continuing to develop more cost-effective direct mailing techniques to ensure the highest possible return on the millions of direct mail pieces sent annually. Its six separate catalogs targeted specific groups such as contractors, hardware stores, multifamily lodgings, LP gas dealers, and export/international customers. The catalogs averaged 900 pages in length and were being sent out two or three times a year. In addition to the catalogs, monthly promotional flyers were being sent out to existing and potential customers. Barnett also continued its strategy of establishing regional distribution centers. The company opened its 34th distribution center in Parsippany, New Jersey, and U.S. Lock opened its sixth distribution center in Dallas, Texas, and had plans to open new centers in Orlando, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, by the fall of 1999.

After its IPO, Barnett managed to nearly double its catalog mailings from 2.5 million to 4.5 million, resulting in a growth of its customer base from 13,000 to nearly 51,000 in just one year. This turned out to be only the beginning for Barnett. 
Acquisitions and Growth in the Mid-1990s 
In 1997 Barnett Inc. purchased LeRan Gas Products from Waxman Industries. LeRan was a direct marketer of liquid propane gas products. In the same year the company added warehouse locations in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, bringing the number of warehouse outlets to 32. In 1997 Barnett also added 1,800 new items to its product line, hired more telesales support staff, and stepped up its mailings from 2.5 million flyers in 1996 to 4.5 million in 1997. The company's success did not go without notice. On November 3, 1997 Forbes magazine ranked Barnett as 60th in its list of the "Top 200 Best Small Companies in America." The following spring, the magazine Catalog Age listed Barnett as one of the "100 Largest Business-to-Business Companies in the Nation." CEO William R. Pray attributed Barnett's success to the talent and dedication of its employees and to a simple strategy: "All the expansion is from our cash flow. We have no debt." 
By 1998 Barnett boasted a customer base of 65,000 customers and Pray had aggressive goals of increasing the number of its mailings to seven million. Barnett also was making plans to expand dramatically into such new markets as hotels, hospitals, and schools. Effective telesales had proven to be an important aspect of Barnett's strategy. All of its telesalespersons were required to go through extensive product and skills training over a period of several months and then were assigned a specific customer database with whom to develop positive service-oriented relationships. This, coupled with Barnett's distribution center network, gave it the ability to respond personally and quickly to every customer need. The commitment to customer service resulted in a high customer retention rate of 84 percent for Barnett as compared with the 65 percent overall average in the direct mail industry. 
The year 1998 proved to be the strongest ever for Barnett as it positioned itself for future growth. It moved into its new 39,000-square-foot international headquarters and call center on Jacksonville, Florida's west side in the LaVilla district. Barnett also expanded product lines by ten percent and recorded a net sales gain of 24.7 percent. By this time the company had a product line of more than 11,900 items being distributed to countries throughout North America, South America, and the Caribbean. "Barnett is a highly energetic, highly focused company," said Jeffrey Germanotta, an analyst with Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. In 1998 he forecasted Barnett's earnings to rise from 87 cents a share to $1.10 in fiscal 1999 and $1.37 in fiscal 2000. 
For the Home and the World: 1998 and Beyond 
Barnett entered into a strategic alliance with the Hechinger Company, a leading retailer of products and services in the care, repair, remodeling, and maintenance of the home and garden. In 1998 Hechinger operated more than 200 stores under the names of Hechinger, Home Quarters Warehouse, and Builder's Square. With the combined catalog and telemarketing strength of Barnett and the outside sales force of Hechinger, customers would experience a full line of products along with next day delivery service to nearly 95 percent of the U.S. market. 
By year's end 1998, Barnett also purchased all of the assets of U.S. Lock from Waxman Industries, Inc. for approximately $33 million. U.S. Lock was a leading distributor of security hardware to locksmiths and other security hardware installers, distributing more than 8,500 national brand name and private label products through its telesales operations, catalogs, and monthly promotional flyers throughout the United States. At the time of the acquisition, William Pray stated: "We believe the acquisition of U.S. Lock is a good strategic fit for Barnett, combining two direct mail, telesales businesses that have similar business models. We are excited about the opportunity to fortify U.S. Lock's solid growth strategies. With the continued leadership of Michael Gene Merber as President of U.S. Lock, together with his strong management team and infrastructure currently in place, we believe U.S. Lock is competitively positioned for continued sales and profit growth. This transaction will be a credit to our earnings and there are many synergistic opportunities for the businesses." 
Success would not be limited to the home front, however. Barnett began to broaden its business plan and expand overseas. In 1997 international sales were at six percent. By 1998 the company saw an increase in worldwide sales to ten percent of its business. 
As the millennium came to a close, Barnett was stronger than ever. Net sales for the nine months that ended March 31, 1999 totaled $174.4 million compared with $148.0 million in the prior year period, an increase of 17.8 percent. The company's net income totaled $11.3 million, an increase of 8.9 percent over the same period the previous year. 
Commenting on the company's progress, Pray said, "The third quarter of our fiscal year generated a very impressive revenue increase in excess of 29 percent and once again reached record levels, however, our revenue growth did not meet our expectations. A slower than anticipated rate of new product introductions in the quarter, coupled with a disappointing roll-out of the Hechinger program were the primary reasons for our lower than expected performance. We are very encouraged by our internal growth rate versus our core growth rate indicating that we are getting increased market share. Our U.S. Lock subsidiary performance was very impressive and met our expectations." 
During 1999 Barnett also had plans to add about 2,000 new products to its line and continue expansion overseas. The company also was continuing to develop more cost-effective direct mailing techniques to ensure the highest possible return on the millions of direct mail pieces sent annually. Its six separate catalogs targeted specific groups such as contractors, hardware stores, multifamily lodgings, LP gas dealers, and export/international customers. The catalogs averaged 900 pages in length and were being sent out two or three times a year. In addition to the catalogs, monthly promotional flyers were being sent out to existing and potential customers. Barnett also continued its strategy of establishing regional distribution centers. The company opened its 34th distribution center in Parsippany, New Jersey, and U.S. Lock opened its sixth distribution center in Dallas, Texas, and had plans to open new centers in Orlando, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, by the fall of 1999. 
Principal Subsidiaries: U.S. Lock Corporation.

“I really noticed my hair loss when I definitely turned 25 and it was kind of funny, I did start to laugh, like, ‘Hey, I really am losing my hair.’
Then it really got serious, so I really started to look and research different places that could help me out, and all the roads led me to Bosley, which I’m very pleased about.”
– Jared H.




HAIR LOSS TREATMENT OPTIONS
There are two main types of hair loss treatment options—surgical and non-surgical.  Non-surgical hair loss treatments include options like Propecia or Lasercomb. Surgical hair restoration can be performed by a Bosley physician as either a follicular unit transfer (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE) hair restoration.
For those suffering from hereditary hair loss, there is unfortunately no hair loss cure. In such cases, medication like Propecia, Rogaine and even the Lasercomb may help to slow down the progression of hair thinning and baldness. For early stages of hair thinning, these hair loss solutions can help regrow some hair, but they will not fully restore the hair and hairline that have been lost.
The only proven, permanent solution to genetic hair loss is hair transplantation. It works by surgically restoring hair from the donor area to the recipient (thinning) area.
While surgical hair transplantation is the only permanent and the most significant receding hairline treatment, these other hair loss solutions can help in your fight against hair loss.

SURGICAL HAIR TRANSPLANTATION
Surgical hair transplantation involves transplanting hair follicles from one area of the head (called the donor area) to another (the recipient area). Most causes of hair loss may be traced to the hormone DHT. In hair transplantation, DHT-resistant follicles are removed from the scalp and artfully placed in thinning areas on the top and front of the head. Our patients find there are many benefits of hair transplantation over other treatment options. You may also wish to see the steps involved in a Bosley hair replacement procedure.


FOLLICULAR UNIT EXTRACTION
The Bosley Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) is a minimally invasive hair transplantation technique in which follicular unit grafts (hair follicles) are individually removed from the patient’s donor area and then individually transplanted to the recipient (thinning) area.
The grafts are removed using a precision tool and then placed in the recipient area. There is no linear scar and no stitches are required, so your donor area will be minimally noticeable within just a few days.


BOSLEY LASERCOMB® ELITE
The Bosley LaserComb® Elite is the only FDA-approved medical device that emits controlled laser energy to stimulate hair follicles and promote re-growth. Although the LaserComb is not a hair loss cure, it is an ideal treatment for individuals with very early-stage hair loss where hair restoration surgery is not indicated. Although it is not intended to treat advanced hair loss, the Bosley LaserComb® Elite may be used either on pre-operative and/or post-operative patients to improve the results of hair restoration surgery. You can purchase the Bosley LaserComb® Elite online from the Bosley Store.


THERADOME™ LASER HELMET
The Theradome™ Laser Helmet is an over-the-counter FDA cleared wearable clinical-strength therapy device for the treatment of hair-loss. It is non-invasive, and is intended for use in the privacy and convenience of one’s own home. The Theradome™ Laser Helmet uses Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) as an effective treatment in hair loss, and has been proven to slow down and stop hair loss, to strengthen hair by doubling follicle size and to regrow new, healthy hair via cellular rejuvenation. Read more on the Theradome Laser Helmet.


BOSLEY HAIRMAX LASER BAND
Stimulating hair growth has never been easier, faster or more sophisticated. Featuring 82 medical grade lasers, the HairMax LaserBand provides a super-fast 90 second treatment. The LaserBand’s unique curved design and exclusive hair parting teeth provide optimal delivery of nourishing laser light to energize your hair follicles and regrow your hair!


BOSLEY PROFESSIONAL STRENGTH
Bosley Professional Strength is a complete system to help prevent hair loss and restore thinning hair – in 5 simple daily steps. Offered in Men’s and Women’s formulations, Bosley Professional Strength contains ingredients that nourish and invigorate the scalp and hair, creating the perfect environment for the growth of thick, healthy hair. Bosley Professional Strength for Men, including the FDA approved 5% Minoxidil solution, comes in a complete 6-month treatment kit and is available only through your Bosley counselor. Significant growth typically occurs in 4-6 months, and consistent compliance is required to maintain the most positive results.


PRESCRIPTION PROPECIA®
Propecia® is an FDA-approved tablet taken once a day, available by prescription only. Propecia works to inhibit the formation of the DHT hormone that weakens hair and halts its growth. Propecia is not a balding cure, and is not approved for use by women. Propecia must be taken on an on-going basis to maintain its benefit. You can get more information on Propecia during a Bosley consultation.
