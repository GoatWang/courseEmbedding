Interactive Products OverviewProducts OverviewR2M - Real-Time Remote Monitoring & DiagnosticsE2M - Engineering Maintenance ManagementC2M - Component Condition MonitoringP2M - Planning & Performance Management






Products Overview
Trimble R2M—Real-time Remote Diagnostic MonitoringThe Trimble R2M system combines shore-based software and on-train equipment to deliver alerts of faults as they occur for effective condition based maintenance. Communicating with the maintenance depots in real time, it allows for efficient fault diagnostics, and work scheduling by the maintenance team. Furthermore, by analyzing irregularities of individual components and their behavior across the entire fleet, it allows maintenance actions to be performed to potentially avoid future failures. 
Trimble E2M—Engineering Maintenance Management
The Trimble E2M system is an enterprise-wide engineering, asset, and maintenance management system. It is designed to control assets, manage stock, streamline procurement, schedule workshop operations, and plan maintenance, in order to achieve optimum asset availability and labor utilization. 
Trimble C2M—Component Condition Monitoring
Trimble’s C2M system combines trackside and handheld measuring devices with software analytics to proactively monitor wheels, brakes, pantographs, and other key components for wear and defects. By detecting and analyzing anomalies, it provides predictive advice of maintenance requirements and automates maintenance planning. 
Trimble P2M—In-Service Performance Planning & Management
The Trimble P2M system uses timetable, actual vehicle location, and real-time diagnostics information to help identify the root cause of delays and plan journeys for optimum timetable adherence. Through a combination of journey planning and improved driver awareness, it also maximizes energy/fuel efficiency, and helps manage driver behavior. P2M also provides the operations teams with in-service recommendations when fleet failures occur to reduce delays and penalties. And P2M provides notifications of potential in-service failures likely to occur across the entire fleet. Trimble P2M is also available as an on-board cab advisory system for drivers.

GreenSeeker Crop Sensing System
 
The Trimble® GreenSeeker® crop sensing system helps you effectively and precisely manage crop inputs on-the-go. With GreenSeeker, you can address field variability by applying the right amount of fertilizer, in the right place, at the right time.

Create a high-yielding environment for your crop to grow
Reduce nutrient input costs by eliminating excess application
Eliminate the need for application maps or agronomist recommendations
Operate night or day, and in fog or clouds

The GreenSeeker system uses optical sensors to measure and quantify the variability of the crop. It then creates a targeted prescription to treat the crop variability. Use GreenSeeker to apply your UAN, UREA, and NH3 to help increase crop yields and ultimately increase your profitability.

GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor
The Trimble GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor is an affordable, easy-to-use measurement device that can be used to assess the heath—or vigor—of a crop in order to make better nutrient management decisions on your farm.


More +

Use the GreenSeeker handheld to instantly take a reading of your crop’s health. Readings can be used to make non-subjective decisions regarding the amount of fertilizer to be applied to your crop, resulting in more efficient use of fertilizer—a benefit to your bottom line and the environment.
How it works


The sensor emits brief bursts of red and infrared light, and then measures the amount of each type of light that is reflected back from the plant
The sensor continues to sample the scanned area as long as the trigger remains engaged
The sensor displays the measured value in terms of an NDVI reading (ranging from 0.00 to 0.99) on its LCD display screen
The strength of the detected light is a direct indicator of the health of the crop; the higher the reading, the healthier the plant

Use the Trimble Ag Software scout app on a smartphone or tablet to calculate fertilizer application rates from crop readings taken with the GreenSeeker handheld.
Benefits

High-quality optical sensor to instantly measure plant vigor
Easy-to read display, even in sunlight
Simple pull-type trigger and comfortable hand grip
Micro USB charging port
