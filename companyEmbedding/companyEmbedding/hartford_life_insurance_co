	Great rates and rewards on car insurance from The Hartford.
Switch your car insurance to the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford1 and save. Enjoy great rates that recognize your experience and the extra benefits you deserve as an AARP member. You may even be eligible for additional savings. To learn more about the added automobile insurance savings and benefits for which you are eligible, get a quote. It’s easy!
 

Lifetime Renewability
Once you have an auto insurance policy with The Hartford, your coverage will be renewed for as long as you’re able to drive. Just meet a few simple requirements such as maintaining a valid driver's license and paying your premiums.†
 



12-Month Rate Protection
You can relax knowing your low auto insurance premium is locked-in for a full year. This sets us apart from other insurers who may change rates every six months or even sooner.
 

RecoverCare – Assistance After an Accident
The Hartford is here for you if you're injured in an automobile accident. This coverage provides reimbursement for essential home services you cannot perform yourself, such as house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and even dog walking. This coverage applies when injuries are not already covered by Medicare or health insurance.§
 

New Car Replacement Coverage
If you total your new car within the first 15 months or 15,000 miles after you buy it (whichever comes first), we’ll pay to replace it with a new vehicle of the same make, model and equipment – with no deduction for depreciation.§§
 

Lifetime Car Repair Assurance
Use one of the 1,600+ authorized repair shops in our approved network, and we’ll stand behind the workmanship of covered repairs for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. With this great coverage, you won’t have to go through the hassle of finding a trusted repair service after an accident.
 

24/7 Claims Hotline
Accidents can happen any time of day or night and you deserve an automobile insurance company that can respond immediately no matter what time you call. You can reach our claims reporting service 24/7, and we’ll walk you through the car insurance claims process. Our 6-Point Claim Commitment is your assurance of getting prompt, caring service from the start of your claim to the end.
 

Enjoy even more car insurance protection.


ADVANTAGE PLUS Program‡
In addition to the features and benefits mentioned above, the Advantage PLUS package includes:
 

First Accident Forgiveness 
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. Once you qualify, if you’re involved in an accident, that first accident will be forgiven and your premium won’t increase as a result. To qualify, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for five consecutive years.
 

Disappearing Deductible
We believe in rewarding great drivers. With our disappearing deductible, your collision deductible on your car insurance policy will go down each year – all the way to $0 – as long as you maintain a clean driving record.‡
 

One Deductible
If you file a claim for a loss involving two of your vehicles that are covered by a car insurance policy with The Hartford, you'll pay only one deductible – whichever is higher – for the covered losses to the vehicles. This benefit also applies if your car and home are involved in the same covered loss and you carry homeowners insurance with The Hartford. You'll pay only the highest deductible.‡
 

Waiver of Deductible for a Not-At-Fault Accident
In most cases, if you are not at fault in an accident, The Hartford will waive your deductible.
 

$100 Deductible Reduction
Typically, even if you’re not at fault, you may have to pay out of pocket for repair costs that fall below the deductible amount of your car insurance policy. With The Hartford, you can have your car repaired at any shop you choose. However, when you elect to use a Hartford-authorized shop for vehicle repair, we’ll reduce your collision deductible by $100. Not available in all states.
 
 
† If you are age 50 or older, once you're insured through this Program for at least 60 days, you cannot be refused renewal as long as applicable premiums are paid when due. Also, you and other customary drivers of your vehicles must retain valid licenses, remain physically and mentally capable of operating an automobile, have no convictions for driving while intoxicated and must not have obtained your policy through material misrepresentation. Benefit currently not available in HI, MI, NH and NC.
 

§ Availability of RecoverCare benefit and benefit levels vary by state. The Hartford RecoverCare Advantage® is a registered mark of The Hartford.
 
§§ Limitations apply.
 
‡ Some benefits, including First Accident Forgiveness and the Disappearing Deductible, are only available with the Advantage Plus package. A policy without these benefits is also available. [Call for details.] To qualify for the Accident Forgiveness benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record (no accidents or violations) for five consecutive years. First Accident Forgiveness is not available to CA policyholders. To qualify for the Disappearing Collision Deductible benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for three consecutive years. NY drivers are not eligible for the complete disappearance of the deductible, although it will be reduced to a minimum of $100. The Advantage Plus package option, the Disappearing Deductible benefit and the Accident Forgiveness benefit are not available in all states.

	Tailor your car insurance at a rate you can afford.

With the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford, you don’t have to sacrifice to save. You can tailor your car insurance coverage to suit your needs at a rate you can afford.
 
A cracked windshield. A dented fender. Injuries that require medical care. Accidents can be costly. Feel confident behind the wheel knowing you have the car insurance coverage you need. Here’s how our coverages help protect you:
 

Collision Coverage
Helps pay for damage done to your car in the event of a collision – whether it’s with another vehicle or an object. For example, if you back into a tree and damage your car, this coverage could help pay the repair fees.
 
Learn About Collision
 

Non-Collision Damage
Also known as “comprehensive,” this car insurance coverage helps pay for “non-collision” damage to your car resulting from things like natural disasters, theft and vandalism. For example, if you park your car under a tree during a snowstorm and heavy snow takes down a branch and breaks your windshield, non-collision damage insurance could help pay the cost to repair the damage to your car.

 
Learn About Non-Collision
 


Car Insurance Medical Payments
Helps cover medical care, recovery, rehab, and remedial care for you and your family after an auto accident.

 
Learn About Medical Payments
 


Auto Policy Bodily Injury Liability
This coverage can protect you against financial loss and helps pay the legal costs in the event you cause an auto accident injuring another person. For example, if you accidentally run a red light, or spin out in the snow and end up injuring another person, this coverage could help cover the costs of those injuries.

 
Learn About Bodily Injury
 


Property Damage Liability
Pays for damage your vehicle causes to other people's property (e.g. fences, mailboxes, other vehicles). For example, if your car slides out in the rain and you take out a neighbor’s mailbox or damage their landscaping, this insurance could help pay for the damages.

 
Learn About Property Damage
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury
Pays bodily injury and death expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver.

 
Learn About Uninsured Bodily Injury
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Property Damage
Helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your vehicle is struck by an uninsured driver, a hit-and-run driver, or an insured driver whose property damage liability limit is too low to cover the losses, this coverage helps pay for the damage.

 
Learn About Uninsured Property Damage
 


Personal Injury Protection a.k.a. “No-Fault Insurance”
Pays for losses tied only to injuries – regardless of who caused the accident. This can be especially helpful after an accident that involves multiple cars. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About No-Fault Insurance
 


Glass Coverage
Full glass coverage pays the amount of a covered glass loss with no deductible. For example, let’s say your car gets broken into overnight and a window is smashed. The estimate to repair it comes in at $600. If you have comprehensive automobile insurance but not auto glass coverage, you will have to pay your deductible before insurance begins to cover the cost to repair the windshield.
 
If you have full glass coverage, the expense of repairing the window is covered in full with no out-of-pocket costs to you. This coverage is optional on your auto insurance policy and can be purchased for an additional premium. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About Glass
 


Towing Coverage
This coverage helps pay towing and labor charges associated with getting your vehicle running again in the event of a break down. For example, if your car battery dies on the interstate, this coverage could help pay for the costs of having your vehicle jumped started.

 
Learn About Towing
 


Rental Car Expense
Transportation Expense coverage helps to pay for a rental car in the event of a covered comprehensive or collision loss. For example, you slide off a wet road crashing into a tree, this coverage could help pay for the charges to rent a replacement vehicle while yours is in the shop for repairs.

 
Learn About Rental Expense
 


Personal Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella coverage goes beyond accidents and damages and helps when a covered loss exceeds the liability coverage limits of your home or auto policies. For example, if you are sued and the legal costs exceed the limits of your primary coverage, umbrella coverage can help cover the excess costs.
 
Learn About Umbrella

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Did you know?
44%  of U.S.  households (48 million households) believe they need more life insurance.
 
 (Trends in Life Insurance Ownership, report by LIMRA, 2005)







 

Life Insurance 
Like  you, we believe that family is what matters most. Day in and day out you work  hard to provide for your loved ones. But who will care for your family if something  happens to you?  
 
At The  Hartford1, our life insurance products are designed to help secure your  family’s future if you no longer can. Since no one is immune to a serious  accident or health issue, it’s best to be prepared just in case. 
 
That’s why it’s important to learn about life  insurance and understand the options available to you. By doing so, you’ll  provide financial protection to your family and gain peace of mind knowing that  they’ll be cared for, no matter what the future holds.





Group  Term Life Insurance Overview


Life  insurance is a financial resource for your loved ones in the event of your  death. When you buy life insurance, your insurance company promises to provide  your beneficiaries with a certain amount of money upon your death. In return,  you make periodic payments, called premiums. The premium amount is based on  factors such as your age, gender, medical history, and the dollar amount of  life insurance you purchase. 



Basic  Life Insurance

This is  generally paid for by your employer, who selects the benefit schedule including  the benefit amount and duration of the policy.




Dependent  Life Insurance


This is  generally paid by you.  The benefit  amounts available to select are typically determined by your employer.  This insurance provides term life insurance,  at group rates, for your spouse and/or dependent children.




Supplemental/Voluntary  Life Insurance


This is paid by you - either wholly or partially.  This insurance may be purchased   in conjunction with Basic Life Insurance or purchased separately.  When you   elect to purchase Supplemental/Voluntary Life, you select the amount of   additional life insurance based on your individual needs.  
 
The  supplemental/voluntary group term life insurance available through many  employers is an affordable way to purchase the extra protection that you and  your family may need.  Because it’s  available to you at group rates, group term life insurance is one of the least  expensive ways to buy life insurance.   And since the premiums are lower than other types of life insurance, you  can afford to purchase higher amounts of coverage. 




Purchasing  insurance is a personal choice



A single  person’s life insurance should cover personal debt such as a student loan or  home mortgage.
A dual-income family with young  children might need more insurance to maintain their lifestyle than a couple  nearing retirement age without any dependent children.
The family breadwinner might consider  spousal coverage to help provide for child care costs and household  services.
Couples close to retirement might  purchase life insurance to help ensure that the surviving spouse can  retire as planned.

 
So the  amount of insurance you need will depend on your current financial and family  situations.

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

About Hartford Fire Insurance Company


   The Hartford Financial Services Group is an insurer with a range of commercial and personal property/casualty insurance and financial products. Its commercial operations include auto, liability, workers' compensation policies, as well as group benefits and specialty commercial coverage for large companies. The Hartford also offers consumer homeowners and auto coverage. It has been the direct auto and home insurance writer for AARP's members for more than 30 years. Through its mutual fund division, the company offers wealth management products and services. The Hartford, in business since 1810, sells products through a network of independent agents and brokerages.
  
Operations

   The Hartford's core operations revolve around property/casualty offerings, which are split up into commercial and consumer divisions. Other operating divisions include the group benefits unit and the mutual funds business. Altogether, its divisions serve some 18 million individuals.
  

   The Hartford operates through six reporting segments: Commercial Lines (35% of total revenue), Personal Lines (21%), Group Benefits (17%), Talcott Resolution (6%), Mutual Funds (4%), and Property & Casualty Other Operations. It also has a Corporate segment. Commercial Lines provides workers' compensation, property, auto, marine, livestock, liability, and umbrella coverages, as well as customized products and risk management services including professional liability, bond, surety, and specialty casualty coverage. Personal Lines provides auto, homeowners, and personal umbrella coverage, including its special program designed exclusively for AARP members.
  

   The Group Benefits segment provides employers, associations, and other groups with group life, accident, and disability products, as well as other lines including voluntary benefits and group retiree health.
  

   The firm's Talcott Resolution unit manages remaining runoff annuity and institutional life offerings; group life products continue to be offered through the group benefits division.
  

   Mutual Funds offers investment products and investment management and administrative services such as product design, implementation, and oversight.
  

   In 2014 the company sold Hartford Life Insurance KK, the latest in a series of moves to exit the annuity and most of its life insurance operations.
  
Geographic Reach

   The Hartford writes business for customers throughout the US from some 100 offices. While the US accounts for the majority of revenues, the company also has operations in international countries.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The Hartford promotes its commercial and group benefits products through a network of thousands of agents and brokers, as well as third-party administrators and trade associations. It markets personal lines through a number of channels, including direct-to-consumer campaigns as well as independent agents. The company's mutual funds team sells through broker-dealer organizations, independent financial advisors, defined contribution plans, bank trust groups, and other channels.
  
Financial Performance

   The Hartford's revenues have fluctuated over the past five years. In 2015 revenue declined 1% to $18.4 billion as investment earnings fell.
  

   Restructuring efforts helped the company return to profitability in 2010, but the company fell back in the red in 2012 due to debt restructuring, payoffs, and goodwill impairments on divested assets. Net income has been on the rise since and, in 2015, it rose 111% to $1.7 billion. Income from discontinued operations and a decline in operating costs helped the company's bottom line that year.
  

   Cash flow from operations has also been up and down. In 2015 it increased 46% to $2.8 billion due to the higher net income and other factors.
  
Strategy

   Following the divestiture of most of its life and annuity operations, The Hartford is focused on growth of its property/casualty, mutual fund, and group benefits operations. In 2013 it announced plans to spend more than $1.5 billion over four years to modernize its systems in order to deliver new products faster and gets its infrastructure up to speed for the digital world.
  

   The company sold operations through a number of transactions completed between 2012 and 2014 due to shareholder pressure. In 2014 it sold Hartford Life Insurance KK to ORIX Life Insurance for $963 million. Other divestitures or closures included Woodbury Financial Services, the firm's retirement plans and individual life businesses, individual annuity operations, and its UK variable annuity marketing and distribution operations (which took The Hartford out of that country completely).
  

   The company has been focused on growth in its commercial markets and consumer markets segments. The Hartford's consumer markets division seeks marketing alliances, such as its exclusive arrangement to provide auto and homeowners polices to members of AARP. Pleased with the results of working with AARP, The Hartford has pulled back on mass marketing and is targeting other affinity groups, striking arrangements with the American Kennel Club, the Sierra Club, and the National Wildlife Federation. Meanwhile, the commercial division aims to grow by offering diversified products and services, especially to small and midsized businesses.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2016, The Hartford bought Maxum Specialty Insurance Group for $168 million. Maxum Indemnity is an authorized excess and surplus lines provider in 49 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands; Maxum Casualty Insurance is active throughout the US.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The Hartford Life Insurance Company is part of The  Hartford Financial Services Group, which was established in 1810. As a whole  the company is one of the world’s largest insurance and investment companies.  The company has international operations in Japan, Brazil, The UK, Canada and  Ireland. The Hartford Life Insurance subsidiary is a leading provider of life  insurance products, in addition to investment products, annuities, mutual  funds, and college savings plans. Usually referred to as “The Hartford”, the  company was recently named to Wards 2009 Top 50 Life Insurance Providers. 
The Current President and COO of Life Operations is John C.  Walters 
The Company is headquartered in Hartford, CT.
According To the Company
Well known for its Elk Logo, The Hartford Life Insurance  Company provides 10, 15, 20 and 30 year term life insurance polices. In  addition to Term Life, like most mutual life insurance companies, The Hartford  also provides a variety of Permanent Life insurance products to individuals and  businesses. 
The Hartford reminds those interested in life insurance that  the death benefits of life  insurance offer not only piece of mind – but a life insurance policy can be a  key component of a plan for your financial future. Life insurance offers income  protection as well as estate liquidity to protect assets and cover  often-substantial estate taxes. 
Hartford representatives say that no matter your life  circumstances, or whether you are considering Term or Permanent Life insurance  – the earlier you purchase your life insurance policy – the better off you will  be.  If you feel you are in the market  only for Term Life insurance, the younger and healthier you are – the cheaper  you rate will be. If you are interested in the cash value aspects of a Whole  Life insurance option, again the younger you are – the more time you will have  to accumulate the greatest benefit.
