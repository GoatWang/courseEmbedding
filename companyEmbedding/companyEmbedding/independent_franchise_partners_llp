About Us

Independent Franchise Partners, LLP was established in 2009 to offer the Franchise investment approach to institutional investors through a dedicated, independent investment management partnership.
The Franchise investment approach is based on the understanding that a concentrated portfolio of exceptionally high quality companies, whose primary competitive advantage is supported by a dominant intangible asset, will earn attractive long-term returns with less than average volatility.  This is particularly true when those investments are selected with an absolute value bias.
We offer the Franchise strategy through a US equity product and a Global equity product, both of which are available through a segregated account or a range of pooled vehicles.
Capacity in both products is available via a waitlist process.
Please contact us if you would like further information on either of these strategies.

                  Our website (http://www.franchisepartners.com/ (the “Website”)) uses cookies to
                  distinguish you from other users of the Website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the Website and also allows us to
                  improve it over time.
              

                  Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive. Cookies are widely used
                  in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as provide certain information to us.
              

                  A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it
                  expires), and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. Cookies do not by themselves personally identify you, but may be linked to other
                  personal data that you provide to us through your interactions with us and the Website.
              

                  Cookies are typically either “session” or “persistent” cookies. A session cookie will only remain on your computer or mobile device for the duration of
                  your session, and will expire when you either close your web browser or the relevant tab in your web browser. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, will
                  be stored on your device for a set period of time (usually less than a year), after which time they will automatically expire. You can delete persistent
                  cookies at any time using your web browser settings.
