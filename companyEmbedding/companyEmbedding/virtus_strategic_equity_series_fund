Virtus to Become Advisor to Phoenix Edge Series Fund Under Agreement with Phoenix Companies



HARTFORD, Conn., July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (NYSE: PNX) and Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRTS) today announced they have reached an agreement for Virtus to become the advisor and distributor to the Phoenix Edge Series Fund, a variable insurance trust.  Virtus will rename the trust the Virtus Variable Insurance Trust and market the current and new investment strategies to other insurance and annuity companies.

(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090105/NEM020LOGO )
On July 26, the Edge Series board of trustees approved the appointment of Virtus as advisor and distributor of the trust and several fund mergers that, if approved by fund shareholders, should improve the scale and marketability of the trust.
The trust comprises 17 funds and $1.6 billion in assets (at June 30, 2010) that are investment options in Phoenix's variable life and annuity products.  Virtus currently serves as administrator to the trust and subadvisor to $300 million of fund assets, and will assume subadvisory responsibilities for an additional $500 million of fund assets.  Goodwin Capital Advisers, an affiliate of Phoenix, and Aberdeen Asset Management will continue to manage $700 million of assets under subadvisory agreements with Virtus.
Four of the funds, with approximately $100 million of assets, will not be part of the transaction and will be merged into a third-party variable insurance trust at a later date.  Phoenix has an additional $2.2 billion of variable product assets managed by external advisors.
Philip K. Polkinghorn, Phoenix's senior executive vice president, business development, and president of the Phoenix Edge Series Fund, said the transaction is consistent with the company's recent history of strategic partnerships with organizations that can provide particular expertise and benefit Phoenix customers.
"We believe Virtus is best suited to the roles of advisor and distributor because of its track record in adopting funds and solid historical investment performance.  These two attributes will help it attract more assets and allow fund shareholders to benefit from economies of scale, in addition to a refreshed portfolio with a wide range of investment options.  Given Virtus' existing roles, we believe this transition will be seamless and efficient," Polkinghorn said.
George R. Aylward, president and chief executive officer of Virtus, said the transaction offers several benefits to Virtus as well.  In addition to preserving the current economics from its roles as fund administrator and subadvisor, the transaction provides Virtus with an opportunity to improve scale in its business by managing the additional funds and by creating new product and distribution opportunities.
"This is an important step in Virtus' growth strategy because it increases our assets under management by $1.2 billion and gives us a new product line that we can offer to other insurance companies as we expand our distribution reach into the variable insurance trust marketplace," Aylward said.  "We look forward to building on our relationship with Phoenix customers and offering our investment management and administration expertise to other insurance companies."
Financial terms of the agreement, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, were not disclosed, but the economics of the transaction will be based on assets under management going forward.

PHOENIX STRATEGIC EQUITY SERIES FUND                                            
NOTES TO SCHEDULES OF INVESTMENTS                                               
JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED)                                                    
NOTE 1--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                         
     The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
        consistently followed by the Phoenix Strategic Equity Series Fund in the
   preparation of the Schedules of Investments. The preparation of the
 Schedules of Investments in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
     to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and 
       liabilities at the date of the Schedules of Investments. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.                              

A. SECURITY VALUATION                                           
  Equity securities are valued at the official closing price
 (typically last sale) on the exchange on which the securities are
      primarily traded, or if no closing price is available, at the last bid
price.                                                          

       Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or
    valuations provided by a pricing service, which utilizes information
with respect to recent sales, market transactions in comparable 
      securities, quotations from dealers, and various relationships between
securities in determining value.                                

           As required, some securities and assets may be valued at fair value
      as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Trustees.

     Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where
        closing prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of
      readily available market prices. For example, significant events (such
      as movement in the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local
   developments) may occur between the time that foreign markets close
     (where the security is principally traded) and the time that the Fund
      calculates its net asset value (generally, the close of the NYSE) that
      may impact the value of securities traded in these foreign markets. In
   these cases, information from an external vendor may be utilized to
        adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to reflect
    their fair value. Because the frequency of significant events is not
      predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur
on a frequent basis.                                            

        Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.   

      In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
        157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines
        fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
  disclosures about fair value measurements. Management is currently
      evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Funds'
financial statement disclosures.                                

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INCOME                     
      Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend
     income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain
       foreign securities, as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is
        recorded on the accrual basis. Each Fund amortizes premiums and accretes
        discounts using the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses
are determined on the identified cost basis.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION                                 
            Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using
        the foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting
       period. Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate
effective at the trade date.                                    

D. FOREIGN SECURITY COUNTRY DETERMINATION                       
     A combination of the following criteria is used to assign the
    countries of risk listed in the schedules of investments: country of
     incorporation, actual building address, primary exchange on which the
  security is traded and country in which the greatest percentage of
company revenue is generated.                                   

NOTE 2--ASSET CONCENTRATIONS                                    

        In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may
      present greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of
       such investments may be volatile. The consequences of political, social
       or economic changes in these markets may have disruptive effects on the
        market prices of these investments and the income they generate, as well
as a Fund's ability to repatriate such amounts.                 

          Each Fund may invest a high percentage of their assets in specific
      sectors of the market in their pursuit of a greater investment return.
        Fluctuations in these sectors of concentration may have a greater impact
       on a Fund, positive or negative, than if a Fund did not concentrate its
investments in such sectors.                                    

         At January 31, 2007, the Dynamic Growth Fund and the Strategic Growth
   Fund held securities issued by various companies in the Information
     Technology sector, comprising 31% and 34%, respectively, of the total
net assets of the Funds.                                        

ITEM 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
          or persons  performing  similar  functions,  have  concluded  that the
          registrant's  disclosure  controls and  procedures (as defined in Rule
          30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended (the
          "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective,  as of a date within
          90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the  disclosure
          required by this paragraph,  based on the evaluation of these controls
          and  procedures  required by Rule 30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
          270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)  under the Securities
          Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as  amended  (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
240.15d-15(b)).                                             

     (b)  There  were no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
          financial  reporting (as defined in Rule  30a-3(d)  under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during the  registrant's  last
          fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
          to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.                                                  

ITEM 3. EXHIBITS. 

Certifications  pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a)  under the 1940 Act and Section 302 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are attached hereto.

Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation ("PEPCO", "we", "us", or "our") invites you 
to participate in the sale and distribution of shares of registered investment  
companies (which shall collectively be referred to hereinafter as the "Funds")  
for which we are national distributor or principal underwriter, and which may be
listed in Annex A hereto which such Annex may be amended by us from time to     
time. Upon acceptance of this agreement by PEPCO, you may offer and sell shares 
of each of the Funds (hereafter "Shares") subject, however, to the terms and    
conditions hereof including our right to suspend or cease the sale of such      
shares. For the purposes hereof, the above referenced dealer shall be referred  
to as "you".                                                                    

1.   You understand and agree that in all sales of Shares to the public, you    
shall act as dealer for your own account. All purchase orders and     
applications are subject to acceptance or rejection by us in our sole 
  discretion and are effective only upon confirmation by us. Each purchase
    will be deemed to have been consummated in our principal office subject to
our acceptance and effective only upon confirmation to you by us.     

2.   You agree that all purchases of Shares by you shall be made only for the   
  purpose of covering purchase orders already received from your customers
 (who may be any person other than a securities dealer or broker) or for
your own bona-fide investment.                                        

3.   You shall offer and sell Shares purchased pursuant to this agreement for   
  the purpose of covering purchase orders of your customers, to the extent
     applicable, (a) at the current public offering price ("Offering Price") for
     Class A Shares or (b) at the Net Asset Value for Class B and Class C shares
    as set forth in the current prospectus of each of the funds. The offer and
 sale of Class B Shares by you is subject to Annex B hereto, "Compliance
Standards for the Sale of the Phoenix Funds Under Their Alternative
Purchase Arrangements".                                               

4.   You shall pay us for Shares purchased within three (3) business days of the
 date of our confirmation to you of such purchase or within such time as
 required by applicable rule or law. The purchase price shall be (a) the
    Offering Price, less only the applicable dealer discount (Dealer Discount)
  for Class A Shares, if applicable, or (b) the Net Asset Value, less only
   the applicable sales commission (Sales Commission) for Class B or Class C
   Shares, if applicable, as set forth in the current prospectus at the time
the purchase is received by us. We have the right, without notice, to 
 cancel any order for which payment of good and sufficient funds has not
     been received by us as provided in this paragraph, in which case you may be
     held responsible for any loss suffered by us resulting from your failure to
make payment as aforesaid.                                            

P-->EX-99.E.23rd Page of 10TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 3rd
5.   You understand and agree that any Dealer Discount, Sales Commission or fee 
 is subject to change from time to time without prior notice. Any orders
    placed after the effective date of any such change shall be subject to the
 Dealer Discount or Sales Commission in effect at the time such order is
received by us.                                                       

6.   You understand and agree that Shares purchased by you under this Agreement 
   will not be delivered until payment of good and sufficient funds has been
    received by us. Delivery of Shares will be made by credit to a shareholder
   open account unless delivery of certificates is specified in the purchase
    order. In order to avoid unnecessary delay, it is understood that, at your
request, any Shares resold by you to one of your customers will be    
   delivered (whether by credit to a shareholder open account or by delivery
of certificates) in the name of your customer.                        

7.   You understand that on all purchases of Shares to which the terms of this  
Agreement are applicable by a shareholder for whom you are dealer of  
record, we will pay you an amount equal to the Dealer Discount, Sales 
   Commission or fees which would have been paid to you with respect to such
  Shares if such Shares had been purchased through you. You understand and
agree that the dealer of record for this purpose shall be the dealer  
    through whom such shareholder most recently purchased Shares of such fund,
    unless the shareholder or you have instructed us otherwise. You understand
    that all amounts payable to you under this paragraph and currently payable
under this agreement will be paid as of the end of the month unless   
    specified otherwise for the total amount of Shares to which this paragraph
  is applicable but may be paid more frequently as we may determine in our
   discretion. Your request for Dealer Discount or Sales Commission reclaims
will be considered if adequate verification and documentation of the  
     purchase in question is supplied to us, and the reclaim is requested within
three years of such purchase.                                         

8.   We appoint the transfer agent (or identified sub-transfer agent) for each  
     of the Funds as our agent to execute the purchase transaction of Shares and
to confirm such purchases to your customers on your behalf, and you   
   guarantee the legal capacity of your customers so purchasing such Shares.
    You further understand that if a customer's account is established without
  the customer signing the application form, you hereby represent that the
    instructions relating to the registration and shareholder options selected
    (whether on the application form, in some other document or orally) are in
    accordance with the customer's instructions and you agree to indemnify the
     Funds, the transfer agent (or identified sub-transfer agent) and us for any
loss or liability resulting from acting upon such instructions.       

9.   Upon the purchase of Class A Shares pursuant to a Letter of Intent, you    
 will promptly return to us any excess of the Dealer Discount previously
allowed or paid to you over that allowable in respect to such larger  
purchases.                                                            

10.  Unless at the time of transmitting a purchase order you advise us to the   
  contrary, we may consider that the investor owns no other Shares and may
    further assume that the investor is not entitled to any lower sales charge
  than that accorded to a single transaction in the amount of the purchase
order, as set forth in the current prospectus.                        

11.  You understand and agree that if any Shares purchased by you under the     
    terms of this Agreement are, within seven (7) business days after the date
    of our confirmation to you of the original purchase order for such Shares,
   repurchased by us as agent for such fund or are tendered to such fund for
    redemption, you shall forfeit the right to, and shall promptly pay over to
  us the amount of, any Dealer Discount or Sales Commission allowed to you
with respect to such Shares. We will notify you of such repurchase or 
 redemption within ten (10) days of the date upon which certificates are
     delivered to us or to such fund or the date upon which the holder of Shares
     held in a shareholder open account places or causes to be placed with us or
with such fund an order to have such shares repurchased or redeemed.  

12.  You agree that, in the case of any repurchase of any Shares made more than 
  seven (7) business days after confirmation by us of any purchase of such
    Shares, except in the case of Shares purchased from you by us for your own
  bona fide investment, you will act only as agent for the holders of such
Shares and will place the orders for repurchase only with us. It is   
    understood that you may charge the holder of such Shares a fair commission
for handling the transaction.                                         

13.  Our obligations to you under this Agreement are subject to all the         
   provisions of the respective distribution agreements entered into between
us and each of the Funds. You understand and agree that in            

P-->EX-99.E.24th Page of 10TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 4th
performing your services under this agreement you are acting in the   
     capacity of an independent contractor, and we are in no way responsible for
the manner of your performance or for any of your acts or omissions in
connection therewith. Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed to  
    constitute you or any of your agents, employees, or representatives as our
     agent, partner or employee, or the agent, partner of employee of any of the
Funds.                                                                

  In connection with the sale and distribution of shares of Phoenix Funds,
  you agree to indemnify and hold us and our affiliates, employees, and/or
officers harmless from any damage or expense as a result of (a) the   
negligence, misconduct or wrongful act by you or any employee,        
representative, or agent of yours and/or (b) any actual or alleged    
   violation of any securities laws, regulations or orders. Any indebtedness
  or obligation of yours to us whether arising hereunder or otherwise, and
    any liabilities incurred or moneys paid by us to any person as a result of
     any misrepresentation, wrongful or unauthorized act or omission, negligence
of, or failure of you or your employees, representatives or agents to 
    comply with the Sales Agreement, shall be set off against any compensation
  payable under this agreement. Any differential between such expenses and
compensation payable hereunder shall be payable to us upon demand. The
  terms of this provision shall not be impaired by the termination of this
agreement.                                                            

     In connection with the sale and distribution of shares of Phoenix Funds, we
agree to indemnify and hold you harmless from any damage or expense on
    account of the gross and willful negligence, misconduct or wrongful act of
     us or any employee, representative, or agent of ours which arises out of or
    is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material

order to qualify any Fund under the securities laws of such state or  
jurisdiction. The terms of this provision shall not be impaired by the
termination of this agreement.                                        

14.  We will supply you with reasonable quantities of the current prospectus,   
periodic reports to shareholders, and sales materials for each of the 
Funds. You agree not to use any other advertising or sales material   
     relating to the sale of shares of any of the Funds unless other advertising
or sales material is pre-approved in writing by us.                   

15.  You agree to offer and sell Shares only in accordance with the terms and   
    conditions of the then current prospectus of each of the Funds and subject
   to the provisions of this Agreement, and you will make no representations
   not contained in any such prospectus or any authorized supplemental sales
material supplied by us. You agree to use your best efforts in the    
     development and promotion of sales of the Shares covered by this Agreement,
and agree to be responsible for the proper instruction, training and  
     supervision of all sales representatives employed by you in order that such
    Shares will be offered in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. All expenses
 incurred by you in connection with your activities under this Agreement
   shall be borne by you. In consideration for the extension of the right to
exercise telephone exchange and redemption privileges to you and your 
registered representatives, you agree to bear the risk of any loss    
resulting from any unauthorized telephone exchange or redemption      
   instructions from you or your registered representatives. In the event we
determine to refund any amounts paid by any investor by reason of such
     violation on your part, you shall forfeit the right to, and pay over to us,
   the amount of any Dealer Discount or Sales Commission allowed to you with
respect to the transaction for which the refund is made.              

16.  You represent that you are properly registered as a broker or dealer under 
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and are member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and agree to maintain  
     membership in the NASD or in the alternative, that you are a foreign dealer
     not eligible for membership in the NASD. You agree to notify us promptly of
     any change, termination or suspension of the foregoing status. You agree to
    abide by all the rules and regulations of the NASD, including NASD Conduct
 Rule 2830, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in
 full. You further agree to comply with all applicable state and Federal
   laws and the rules and regulations of applicable regulatory agencies. You
further agree that you will not sell, or offer for sale, Shares in any
jurisdiction in which such Shares have not been duly registered or    
     qualified for sale. You agree to promptly notify us with respect to (a) the
     initiation and disposition of any formal disciplinary action by the NASD or
     any other agency or instrumentality having jurisdiction with respect to the
subject matter hereof against you or any

 of your employees or agents; (b) the issuance of any form of deficiency
    notice by the NASD or any such agency regarding your training, supervision
   or sales practices; and (c) the effectuation of any consensual order with
respect thereto.                                                      

17.  Either party may terminate this agreement for any reason by written or     
electronic notice to the other party which termination shall become   
 effective fifteen (15) days after the date of mailing or electronically
 transmitting such notice to the other party. We may also terminate this
    agreement for cause or as a result of a violation by you, as determined by
us in our discretion, of any of the provisions of this Agreement, said
  termination to be effective on the date of mailing written or electronic
notice to you of the same. Without limiting the generality of the     
  foregoing, your own expulsion from the NASD will automatically terminate
   this Agreement without notice. Your suspension from the NASD or violation
    of applicable state or Federal laws or rules and regulations of applicable
   regulatory agencies will terminate this Agreement effective upon the date
   of our mailing written notice or transmitting electronic notice to you of
 such termination. Our failure to terminate this Agreement for any cause
     shall not constitute a waiver of our right to so terminate at a later date.

18.  All communications and notices to you or us shall be sent to the addresses 
  set forth at the beginning of this Agreement or to such other address as
may be specified in writing from time to time.                        

19.  PEPCO agrees to comply with all laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances   
relating to privacy, confidentiality, security, data security, and the
handling of customer information which may from time to time be       
 established. PEPCO agrees not to disclose or use any consumer nonpublic
  personal information (including nonpublic personal financial information
     and nonpublic personal health information), which may be supplied by you to
   PEPCO in performance under this Agreement other than to: a) carry out the
   purpose for which the information was provided; and b) to use or disclose
 the information as otherwise permitted or required by law. You agree to
comply with all laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances relating to

information was provided; and b) to use or disclose the information as
 otherwise permitted or required by law. This provision will survive and
    continue in full force and effect after the termination of this Agreement.

20.  This agreement shall become effective upon the date of its acceptance by us
  as set forth herein. This agreement may be amended by PEPCO from time to
time. This Agreement and all rights and obligations of the parties    
     hereunder shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
    Connecticut. This agreement is not assignable or transferable, except that

dealer of record, due to the nature of the investor's account, notifies the     
Distributor prior to the time of the investment that the dealer waives the      
Finder's Fee otherwise payable to the dealer, or agrees to receive such Finder's
Fee ratably over a 12 month period.

[logo]PHOENIXFUNDS(sm)                          ANNEX B TO DEALER AGREEMENT WITH
A MEMBER OF THE PHOENIX COMPANIES, INC.      PHOENIX EQUITY PLANNING CORPORATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLIANCE STANDARDS FOR
 THE SALE OF THE PHOENIX FUNDS
 UNDER THEIR ALTERNATIVE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS

As national distributor or principal underwriter of the Phoenix Funds, which    
offer their shares on both a front-end and deferred sales charge basis, Phoenix 
Equity Planning Corporation ("PEPCO") has established the following compliance  
standards which set forth the basis upon which shares of the Phoenix Funds may  
be sold. These standards are designed for those broker/dealers ("dealers") that 
distribute shares of the Phoenix Funds and for each dealer's financial          
advisors/registered representatives.                                            

As shares of the Phoenix Funds are offered with two different sales arrangements
for sales and distribution fees, it is important for an investor not only to    
choose a mutual fund that best suits his investment objectives, but also to     
choose the sales financing method which best suits his particular situation. To 
assist investors in these decisions and to ensure proper supervision of mutual  
fund purchase recommendations, we are instituting the following compliance      
standards to which dealers must adhere when selling shares of the Phoenix Funds:

1.   Any purchase of a Phoenix Fund for less than $250,000 may be either of     
    shares subject to a front-end load (Class A shares) or subject to deferred
sales charge (Class B shares).                                        

2.   Any purchase of a Phoenix Fund by an unallocated qualified employer        
    sponsored plan for less than $1,000,000 may be either of shares subject to
a front-end load (Class A shares) or subject to deferred sales charge 
(Class B shares). Class B shares sold to allocated qualified employer 
  sponsored plans will be limited to a maximum total value of $250,000 per
participant.                                                          

3.   Any purchase of a Phoenix Fund for $250,000 or more (except as noted above)
  or which qualifies under the terms of the prospectus for net asset value
purchase of Class A shares should be for Class A shares.              

GENERAL GUIDELINES                                                              

These are instances where one financing method may be more advantageous to an   
investor than the other. Class A shares are subject to a lower distribution fee 
and, accordingly, pay correspondingly higher dividends per share. However,      
because initial sales charges are deducted at the time of purchase, such        
investors would not have all of their funds invested initially and, therefore,  
would initially own fewer shares. Investors not qualifying for reduced initial  
sales charges who expect to maintain their investment for an extended period of 
time might consider purchasing Class A Shares because the accumulated continuing
distribution charges on Class B Shares may exceed the initial sales charge on   
Class A Shares during the life of the investment.                               

Again, however, such investors must weigh this consideration against the fact   
that, because of such initial sales charge, not all of their funds will be      
invested initially. However, other investors might determine that it would be   
more advantageous to purchase Class B Shares to have all of their funds invested
initially, although remaining subject to higher continuing distribution charges 
and, for a five-year period, being subject to a contingent deferred sales charge
(three years for Asset Reserve).                                                

A National Association of Securities Dealers rule specifically prohibits        
"breakpoint sales" of front-end load shares. A "breakpoint sale" is a sale to   
the client of an amount of front-end load (Class A) shares just below the amount
which would be subject to the next breakpoint on the fund's sales charge        
schedule. Because the deferred sales charge on Class B shares is reduced by 1%  
for each year the shares are held, a redemption of Class B shares just before an
"anniversary date" is in some ways analogous to a breakpoint sale. A client     
might wish to redeem just before an anniversary date for tax or other reasons,  
and a client who chose to wait would continue to be at market risk.             
Nevertheless, investment executives should inform clients intending to redeem   
Class B shares near an anniversary date that, if the redemption were delayed,   
the deferred sales charge would be reduced.                                     

RESPONSIBILITIES OF BRANCH OFFICE MANAGER (OR OTHER APPROPRIATE REVIEWING       
OFFICER).                                                                       

A dealer's branch manager or other appropriate reviewing officer ("the Reviewing
Officer") must ensure that the financial advisor/registered representative has  
advised the client of the available financing methods offered by the Phoenix    
Funds, and the impact of choosing one method over another. In certain instances,
it may be appropriate for the Reviewing Officer to discuss the purchase directly
with the client. The reviewing officer should review purchases for Class A or   
Class B shares given the relevant facts and circumstances, including but not
