A D V E R T I S E M E N T




















With a Ph.D. in chemical engineering and an M.B.A. from Wharton, Dicciani, 57, has the ideal skills combination to run Honeywell's specialty materials division. Since her arrival in 2001 from Rohm and Haas, Dicciani has cut costs, boosted sales and emphasized innovation. Patents per year are up from 70 to 114 since her arrival. Dicciani was recently chosen to lead the Honeywell Growth Fund, a $20 million in-house fund aimed at promoting early-stage ideas to product development.V.M.
