requires. The words “include,” “includes”

“shall” are used interchangeably and are intended to
have, and will be deemed to have, the same meaning. The words
“herein,” “hereof,” “hereby”
and “hereunder” and words of similar import refer to

to any statute or regulation are to it as amended and supplemented
from time to time (and, in the case of a statute or regulation, to
any successor provisions, and to any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder), unless the context otherwise requires. Any
reference to a “day” or number of “days”

Company are managed through a board of directors (the “
Board ”) currently consisting of nine members (each, a
“ Director ”). From time to time and at any time
after the Investor Closing and for so long as any principal amount
remains outstanding under the Note (or until such right is
otherwise terminated as provided for in this Agreement), the
Investor (or, if applicable, a Permitted Transferee that is an
Affiliate of the Investor) shall be entitled to nominate one
Director to serve on the Board (the “ Investor Nominee
” and, if elected to the Board, the “ Investor
Director ”), such Investor Nominee to initially be Eric

number as necessary to accommodate the Investor Nominee.

 Section 2.2     
Company

At each meeting of the Company’s stockholders at which the
election of the class II Directors is to be considered, the Company
shall nominate the Investor Nominee so designated by the Investor
for election to the Board by the Company’s stockholders and
use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the
Company’s stockholders in favor of the election of the
Investor Nominee. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Investor Nominee to be elected to the Board (including
voting all unrestricted proxies in favor of the election of such
Investor Nominee and including recommending approval of such
Investor Nominee’s appointment to the Board) and shall not
take any action designed to diminish the prospects of such Investor
Nominee of being elected to the Board.

 Section 2.3

Director appointed pursuant to this Article II shall continue to
hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of
the Company at which the class II Directors are to be elected and
until his or her successor is elected and qualified in accordance
with this Section 2.3 and the bylaws of the Company, unless
such Investor Director is earlier removed from office by the
Investor (or, if applicable, a Permitted Transferee that is an
Affiliate of the Investor) (in which event the Investor shall cause
the Investor Director to resign from the Board) or at such time as
such Investor Director’s death, resignation, retirement or
disqualification. The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts
to ensure that any Investor Director is removed only if so directed
in writing by the Investor, unless otherwise required by this
Section 2.3 or applicable law.
 

8




  

 

Section
2.4     
Vacancies
. In the event of a
vacancy on the Board resulting from the death, disqualification,
resignation, retirement or termination of the term of office of the
Investor Director, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Board to fill such vacancy or new directorship with a
representative designated by the Investor (or, if applicable, a
Permitted Transferee that is an Affiliate of the Investor) to serve
until the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at
which the class II Directors are to be elected (and at such
meeting, such representative, or another representative designated
by such holders, will be nominated to be elected to the Board in
the manner set forth in Section 2.1 ). If the Investor (or,
if applicable, a Permitted Transferee that is an Affiliate of the
Investor) fails or declines to fill the vacancy, then the
directorship shall remain open until such time as the Investor
elects to fill it with a representative designated hereunder. Any
representative designated by the Investor (or, if applicable, a
Permitted Transferee that is an Affiliate of the Investor) to fill
such a vacancy must be a principal or senior executive officer of
the Investor or any of its Affiliates and must have sufficient
industry expertise and professional qualifications to enable such
representative to make meaningful and significant contributions to
the Board, as determined in good faith by the Company.
 ARTICLE III     
 TRANSFER OF
SECURITIES

 Section 3.1     
General Restrictions
on Transfer.

(a)     
At any time when any of
the Securities remain outstanding, the Investor acknowledges and
agrees that it (or any Permitted Transferee) will not voluntarily
or involuntarily Transfer any of the Securities, in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of the Company except (i)
to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 3.1 , (ii) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.2 or (iii) in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 3.3(e) . For the
avoidance of doubt, all issued and outstanding Securities, if
Transferred pursuant to this Section 3.1 or Section
3.2 , may only be Transferred together and in their
entirety.

(b)     
A Transfer of all of
the then issued and outstanding Securities by the Investor (i) to a
Permitted Transferee at any time or (ii) in accordance with
Section 3.3(e) shall, in each case, not be subject to
Section 3.2 .

(c)     
In the event of a
Transfer or attempted Transfer of any of the Securities (i) in
violation of this Agreement or (ii) in accordance with Section
3.3(e) , the rights of the Investor set forth in Article
II will immediately be of no further force or effect and the
Investor shall promptly cause the Investor Director to resign from
the Board.

(d)     
Prior to the
consummation of any Transfer of the Securities by the Investor that
is permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(other than a pledge of, or assignment of a security interest in,
the Securities as collateral for loans or other credit extended to
the Investor by a Lender or a Transfer in accordance with
Section 3.3(e) ), the Investor will cause the transferee
thereof to execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which shall be
in form and substance reasonably
 

9




 

 
acceptable to the Company. Except
as set forth in this Section 3.1 , upon any Transfer by the
Investor of all of its then issued and outstanding Securities in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the transferee thereof
will be substituted for, and will assume all the rights and
obligations under this Agreement of, the Investor; provided, that
if the Transfer is not made to a Permitted Transferee, then any
such transferee shall not be entitled to enforce the rights of the
Investor set forth in Article II which will immediately be
of no further force or effect and the Investor shall promptly cause
the Investor Director to resign from the Board.

(e)     
Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Investor agrees that it will
not, directly or indirectly, Transfer the Securities (i) except as
permitted under the Securities Act and other applicable federal or
state securities laws, and then, if requested by the Company, only
upon delivery to the Company of an opinion of counsel in form and
substance satisfactory to the Company to the effect that such
Transfer may be effected without registration under the Securities
Act, (ii) if it would cause the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to be required to register as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (iii) if it would
cause the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to be
deemed plan assets as defined under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 or its accompanying regulations or result in
any “prohibited transaction” thereunder involving the
Company. In any event, the Company may refuse the Transfer to any
Person if such Transfer would have a material adverse effect on the
Company as a result of any regulatory or other restrictions imposed
by any Governmental Authority.

(f)     
Any Transfer or
attempted Transfer of the Securities in violation of this Agreement
will be null and void, no such Transfer will be recorded on the
Company’s books and the purported transferee in any such
Transfer will not be treated (and the purported transferor will
continue be treated) as the owner of the Securities for all
purposes of this Agreement.

(g)     
Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary or otherwise, the
Investor may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
the Securities to any Lender to secure loans or other credit
extended to the Investor by such Lender and the Company hereby
agrees at any time during which Loans Obligations owing by the
Investor to such Lender shall remain outstanding to make any and
all payments on account of the Securities to one or more accounts
designated in writing by such Lender; provided that no such
pledge or assignment shall release the Investor from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee
for the Investor as a party hereto. In addition, for clarification,
while the Investor shall be permitted to pledge or assign a
security interest in the Securities as collateral for Loan
Obligations, any such Lender shall not be considered to be a
Permitted Transferee upon the disposition or foreclosure of any
such secured interest, which transfer shall be subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 3.3(e) . In no event shall
any such Lender be entitled to enforce the rights of the Investor
set forth in Article II and upon any such disposition or
foreclosure of any such secured interest, the rights of the
Investor set forth in Article II will immediately be of no
further force or effect and the Investor shall promptly cause the
Investor Director to resign from the Board.

Refusal.
