Rogers Board of Directors
The Rogers Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders to oversee the management of the company and to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served. To assist in carrying out its responsibilities, the Board has delegated certain authority to a number of standing committees, including an Audit Committee, Compensation and Organization Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee.
The Board has a designated independent Lead Director, Mr. William E. Mitchell, and the Board is comprised primarily of outside, independent directors and regularly meets in executive session (without the presence of management).
Both the Board of Directors and management recognize that the long-term interests of shareholders are advanced by responsibly addressing the concerns of other shareholders and interested parties including employees, customers, suppliers, Rogers communities and the public at large.
