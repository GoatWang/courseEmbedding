Restaurant Brands International is a Canadian multinational fast food company. Formed in 2014 by the $12.5 billion merger between American fast food restaurant chain Burger King and the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons, and expanded by the 2017 purchase of Louisiana based and themed Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the company is the third-largest operator of fast food restaurants in the world. The company is based alongside Tim Hortons in Oakville, Ontario, but both chains retain their existing operations and headquarters in Oakville and Miami respectively. The merger focused primarily on expanding the international reach of the Tim Hortons brand, and providing financial efficiencies for both companies.
The company is majority-owned by the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital—the previous majority owner of Burger King—holding a 51% stake. The remainder of the company is publicly traded on the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges, and owned by the prior shareholders of Burger King and Tim Hortons. The deal was approved by Tim Hortons' shareholders on December 9, 2014, and the company began trading on December 15, 2014.

History[edit]
On August 24, 2014, U.S. fast food chain Burger King announced that it was in negotiations to merge with the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons;[3] the proposed merger would involve a tax inversion into Canada, with a new holding company majority-owned by Burger King's current majority-owner 3G Capital, and the remaining shares in the company held by current Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth; the two chains would retain separate operations post-merger.[4] News of the proposal caused Tim Hortons' shares to increase in value by 28 percent.[5]
On August 25, 2014, Burger King officially confirmed its intent to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. in a deal totaling CDN$12.5 billion (US$11.4 billion).[6] 3G Capital would purchase the company at $65.50 per-share, and existing shareholders would receive $65.50 in cash and 0.8025 shares in the new holding company: per-share—all-cash ($88.50) and all-shares (3.0879) options would also be available. Due to its iconic status in Canadian culture, CEO Marc Caira reassured the integrity of Tim Hortons following the purchase, stating that the acquisition would "enable us to move more quickly and efficiently to bring Tim Hortons' iconic Canadian brand to a new global customer base."[5][7]
Although tax inversions, a process in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location, have been a recent financial trend, it did not have as much of an impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada. The corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, while Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%: however, Burger King had already used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).[8][9][4][6] 3G Capital co-founder Alex Behring denied that the merger was tax-related, stating that it was "fundamentally about growth and creating value through accelerated expansion."[10]
The deal was approved by the Canadian Competition Bureau on October 28, 2014, ruling that the deal was "unlikely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition."[11] The deal was approved by Minister of Industry James Moore on December 4, 2014: the two companies agreed to conditions, requiring that the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains retain separate operations, not combine locations in Canada and the United States, maintain "significant employment levels" at the Oakville headquarters, and ensure that Canadians make up at least 30% of Tim Hortons' board of directors.[12] Tim Hortons shareholders approved the merger on December 9, 2014: the same day, it was announced that the new holding company would be known as Restaurant Brands International, and trade under the ticker symbol QSR. Vice-chairman Marc Caira felt that the merger was the "next chapter" for Tim Hortons, envisioning a "bolder, more assertive, and dynamic Tim Hortons in the future" alongside its prospects for international expansion.[10][13]
Popeyes acquisition[edit]
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced its intent to acquire Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for US$1.8 billion at US$79 per share.[14] On March 27, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[15]
Ownership and leadership[edit]
3G Capital (which held a 71% majority stake in Burger King) holds a 51% majority stake in Restaurant Brands International.[7] Berkshire Hathaway, who partially funded the merger, holds a 4.8% stake.[16] Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz serves as CEO of the company, with previous Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira being vice-chairman and director. Elías Díaz Sesé, formerly of Burger King's Asia-Pacific operations, was named the new president of Tim Hortons, while Jose Cil, formerly of Burger King's EMEA operations, was named the new president of Burger King.[17]

Restaurant Brands International is a Canadian multinational fast food company. Formed in 2014 by the $12.5 billion merger between American fast food restaurant chain Burger King and the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons, and expanded by the 2017 purchase of Louisiana based and themed Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the company is the third-largest operator of fast food restaurants in the world. The company is based alongside Tim Hortons in Oakville, Ontario, but both chains retain their existing operations and headquarters in Oakville and Miami respectively. The merger focused primarily on expanding the international reach of the Tim Hortons brand, and providing financial efficiencies for both companies.
The company is majority-owned by the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital—the previous majority owner of Burger King—holding a 51% stake. The remainder of the company is publicly traded on the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges, and owned by the prior shareholders of Burger King and Tim Hortons. The deal was approved by Tim Hortons' shareholders on December 9, 2014, and the company began trading on December 15, 2014.

History[edit]
On August 24, 2014, U.S. fast food chain Burger King announced that it was in negotiations to merge with the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons;[3] the proposed merger would involve a tax inversion into Canada, with a new holding company majority-owned by Burger King's current majority-owner 3G Capital, and the remaining shares in the company held by current Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth; the two chains would retain separate operations post-merger.[4] News of the proposal caused Tim Hortons' shares to increase in value by 28 percent.[5]
On August 25, 2014, Burger King officially confirmed its intent to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. in a deal totaling CDN$12.5 billion (US$11.4 billion).[6] 3G Capital would purchase the company at $65.50 per-share, and existing shareholders would receive $65.50 in cash and 0.8025 shares in the new holding company: per-share—all-cash ($88.50) and all-shares (3.0879) options would also be available. Due to its iconic status in Canadian culture, CEO Marc Caira reassured the integrity of Tim Hortons following the purchase, stating that the acquisition would "enable us to move more quickly and efficiently to bring Tim Hortons' iconic Canadian brand to a new global customer base."[5][7]
Although tax inversions, a process in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location, have been a recent financial trend, it did not have as much of an impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada. The corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, while Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%: however, Burger King had already used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).[8][9][4][6] 3G Capital co-founder Alex Behring denied that the merger was tax-related, stating that it was "fundamentally about growth and creating value through accelerated expansion."[10]
The deal was approved by the Canadian Competition Bureau on October 28, 2014, ruling that the deal was "unlikely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition."[11] The deal was approved by Minister of Industry James Moore on December 4, 2014: the two companies agreed to conditions, requiring that the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains retain separate operations, not combine locations in Canada and the United States, maintain "significant employment levels" at the Oakville headquarters, and ensure that Canadians make up at least 30% of Tim Hortons' board of directors.[12] Tim Hortons shareholders approved the merger on December 9, 2014: the same day, it was announced that the new holding company would be known as Restaurant Brands International, and trade under the ticker symbol QSR. Vice-chairman Marc Caira felt that the merger was the "next chapter" for Tim Hortons, envisioning a "bolder, more assertive, and dynamic Tim Hortons in the future" alongside its prospects for international expansion.[10][13]
Popeyes acquisition[edit]
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced its intent to acquire Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for US$1.8 billion at US$79 per share.[14] On March 27, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[15]
Ownership and leadership[edit]
3G Capital (which held a 71% majority stake in Burger King) holds a 51% majority stake in Restaurant Brands International.[7] Berkshire Hathaway, who partially funded the merger, holds a 4.8% stake.[16] Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz serves as CEO of the company, with previous Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira being vice-chairman and director. Elías Díaz Sesé, formerly of Burger King's Asia-Pacific operations, was named the new president of Tim Hortons, while Jose Cil, formerly of Burger King's EMEA operations, was named the new president of Burger King.[17]

Restaurant Brands International Inc. and Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership Announce Initial Receipt of Exchange Notices and Intent to Use $300 Million in Cash to Repurchase Units

Dec 03, 2015, 06:45 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Restaurant Brands International 











 
















































 

 




















 


OAKVILLE, ON, Dec. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Restaurant Brands International Inc. ("RBI") (TSX:QSR; NYSE:  QSR) and Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership ("RBI LP") (TSX:QSP) announced today the receipt of initial Exchange Notices related to units of RBI LP. In connection with the creation of RBI in December of 2014, shareholders of Burger King Worldwide Inc. had the ability to elect to receive units in RBI LP in lieu of shares of RBI. Units in RBI LP can be sold in the open market and are exchangeable for shares of RBI on a 1:1 basis. The exchange of RBI LP units for shares of RBI is subject to a one year restriction period, which ends on December 12, 2015. Approximately 265 million RBI LP units are currently outstanding.            
RBI has received Exchange Notices representing 30.9 million units, including 25.7 million units held by 3G Restaurant Brands Holdings LP ("RBH"), an affiliate of 3G Capital Partners ("3G Capital"). The units represented by the Exchange Notices from RBH comprise approximately 10.5% of RBH's current holdings in RBI and do not include any RBI LP units owned directly or indirectly by the partners of 3G Capital. 
Pursuant to the limited partnership agreement, RBI LP will satisfy the initial Exchange Notices by repurchasing 8.15 million RBI LP units in exchange for approximately $300 million in excess cash and exchanging 22.8 million RBI LP units for the same number of newly issued RBI shares. The exchange requests received to date will be satisfied on or after December 14, 2015, and the repurchase of RBI LP units for cash will be based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of RBI shares traded on the NYSE in US dollars, per the terms of the limited partnership agreement.
Daniel Schwartz, RBI CEO, commented "We continue to be encouraged by the progress we have made in our first full year as RBI and are excited about the prospects for the TIM HORTONS® and BURGER KING® brands in the years to come. The repurchase of 8.15 million RBI LP units is reflective of the confidence we have in our business and is consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation. We are very pleased to have the continued long-term support from 3G Capital and its partners, who share in our vision to grow both of our iconic brands."
