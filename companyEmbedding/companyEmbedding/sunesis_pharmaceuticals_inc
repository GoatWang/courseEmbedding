Strategy
Delivering on our Promise
Our experienced cancer drug development organization is committed to advancing our pipeline of new oncology therapeutics for the potential treatment of solid and hematologic cancers. Our most advanced program is QINPREZO (vosaroxin), our product candidate for the potential treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Vosaroxin is an anticancer quinolone derivative, or AQD — a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer.
Vosaroxin is currently being evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, frontline AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and MDS in patients who have failed frontline treatment with hypomethylating agents. In October 2014, we announced the results from our Phase 3, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal VALOR (Vosaroxin and Ara-C combination evaluating Overall survival in Relapsed/refractory AML) trial. VALOR was designed to evaluate the effect of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine on overall survival as compared to placebo in combination with cytarabine. The trial was conducted at 124 study sites in 15 countries. Patients treated with vosaroxin achieved increased overall survival compared to those treated with placebo (7.5 months vs 6.1 months, HR=0.87), the primary endpoint, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.06). The complete remission (CR) rate, the sole secondary efficacy endpoint in the trial, did demonstrate a significant difference for the vosaroxin combination arm (30.1% vs 16.3%, p < 0.0001). Detailed results of the VALOR trial were presented in the "Late Breaking Abstracts" session of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2014. 
In November 2014, based on results of the trial, we submitted a letter of intent to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) describing our intention to file a marketing authorization application (MAA) for marketing authorization of vosaroxin plus cytarabine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. In June 2015, we met separately with our Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are two appointed members of the EMA's Committee of Human Medicinal Products. Based upon feedback from these meetings, we plan to file an MAA with the EMA as soon as practicable. In July 2015, we met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss a potential regulatory filing in the United States. Based upon the meeting, the FDA recommended that we provide additional clinical evidence prior to any regulatory filing in the U.S. As a result, we will evaluate regulatory and clinical strategies with the goal of gaining future marketing approval in the U.S.
We own worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin. In 2009, vosaroxin received orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of AML from the FDA and in 2012, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML, which may provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries of the European Union following product approval for this indication in Europe. In 2011, the FDA granted fast track designation to vosaroxin for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in combination with cytarabine.
In January 2014, we announced the expansion of our oncology franchise through separate global licensing agreements for two preclinical kinase inhibitor programs. The first agreement, with Biogen Idec MA, Inc. (Biogen Idec) is for global commercial rights to SNS-062, a selective non-covalently binding oral inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). 
The second agreement, with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Millennium), is for global commercial rights to several potential first-in-class, pre-clinical inhibitors of the novel target phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1).
We plan to continue to build Sunesis into a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers by:

filing an MAA with the EMA as soon as practicable, with the goal of obtaining regulatory approval for vosaroxin as a potential treatment for relapsed or refractory AML in Europe,
evaluating regulatory and clinical strategies with the goal of gaining future marketing approval for vosaroxin in the U.S. and other major markets
leveraging potential partners and distributors to commercialize vosaroxin in selective international markets;
establishing vosaroxin as the new standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory AML;
exploring the broader potential of vosaroxin, beyond our pivotal indication, in different patient segments within AML and MDS through investigator sponsored studies;
investing in additional company-sponsored clinical trials to evaluate vosaroxin for additional AML indications, MDS, other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors;
leveraging our strong intellectual property protection over vosaroxin to realize its full potential;
supporting our multi-kinase inhibitor programs with Millennium in oncology and Biogen Idec for immunology indications;
filing a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) application with the EMA to support a Phase 1A study for our BTK inhibitor, SNS-062, in healthy volunteers;
moving at least one of the two selected development candidates from our PDK1 inhibitor program, SNS-229 and SNS-510, into IND-enabling absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and safety studies; and
continuing to expand and develop our oncology-focused pipeline through further licensing or collaboration arrangements and research and development.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

					Full Description



Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on February 10, 1998, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on the development and commercialization of its pipeline of oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers. The Company offers QINPREZOTM (vosaroxin), which is a product candidate for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Vosaroxin is an anticancer quinolone derivative (AQD). The Company's other kinase inhibitor pipeline include TAK-580, SNS-062 and SNS-229.VosaroxinVosaroxin is an AQD, which is used for the treatment of cancer. The Company has completed a Phase III clinical trial of Vosaroxin for relapsed/refractory AML. The Company is engaged in conducting Phase II clinical trials of Vosaroxin for frontline AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The Company has also conducted two Phase II trials in non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. The Company is focused on investing in the development and clinical testing of Vosaroxin for related disease areas and indications, such as other AML populations, MDS, other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.TAK-580TAK-580 is an oral, investigative drug selective for pan-Raf kinase inhibition, in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The Phase I, multicenter, open-label and dose escalation study was conducted in two stages: dose escalation and cohort expansion. The Company has completed the dose escalation study for TAK-580 and TAK-580 is in the cohort expansion stage of this multicenter study.SNS-062SNS-062 is a non-covalently binding inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK mediates signaling through the B-cell receptor (BCR), which is critical for adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival of normal and malignant B-lineage lymphoid cells. The Company has completed the pre-clinical studies for SNS-062. SNS-062 demonstrated a binding site and pharmacokinetic profile in preclinical studies. It may provide opportunities for treatment of B-cell malignancies and other blood cancers.SNS-229 and SNS-510SNS-229 and SNS-510 are two PDK1 inhibitors. PDK1 is a kinase and mediator of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) signaling, which is a pathway involved in cell growth, differentiation, survival and migration. PDK1 inhibitors have effects on survival and invasion signaling and are active in both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. The Company has taken a series of PDK1 inhibitors with antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo into preclinical development. PDK1 inhibitors are in research and development, and may provide opportunities for treatment of solid and hematological malignancies.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
