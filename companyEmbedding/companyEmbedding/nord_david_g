worm gear efficiency
While worm gears can have low efficiency and wear quicker than some other gears, there are applications where they are a practical solution.




worm gear applications
Applications for worm gears range from elevator lifts to conveyer systems. Here are four common worm gear applications and the benefits of the worm gear design.






worm gear vs bevel gear
The decision of worm gear vs. bevel gear comes down to efficiency. While worm gears are inexpensive to manufacture and purchase, bevel gears are a more efficient investment.

Find Variable Frequency Drive Solutions | NORD Drivesystems
A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is an electronic means of controlling motor operation. VFD's have the ability to control the speed and direction of a motor as well as how it starts and stops. A VFD limits the inrush (starting current) which is advantageous because it is much easier on the motor.Read full article...


Screw Conveyor Drives | Engineering Design
Screw conveyors are designed for moving and distributing bulk material. Some common types of screw conveyors include horizontal/inclined shafted screw conveyors (the most common type of screw conveyor used for bulk material handling), shaftless screw conveyors (typically used with sticky, high moisture and viscous loads), screw feeders and live bottom conveyors (used to move various types of loads at a constant and controlled speed and usually incorporate more than one gearbox) and vertical screw conveyors (used to move dry or semi-fluid loads at very steep inclines).Read full article...
