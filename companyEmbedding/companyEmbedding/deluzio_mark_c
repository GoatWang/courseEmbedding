Cash is lying around everywhere in companies. It's piled to the ceilings in warehouses and on shelves, hiding in plain sight as inventory. It litters administrative offices, disguised as incorrect invoices, late billings, incomplete forms, input errors, sloppy requests from salespeople. It languishes in the countless places a customer's order can hide as it crawls from order entry to production and shipment. It sits in business's lobbies waiting for sales calls to start.All that cash is retrievable, gettable, bankableavailable for re-investment and dividends. Turn Waste into Wealth will help you get that cash by becoming a Lean company.Mark DeLuzio, principle architect of the vaunted Danaher Business System that has led companies to world-class performance, presents hard-hitting tips and numerous case histories that will help you make your company Lean. You'll learn: Why Lean is the modern way to run any organization Eleven steps to transform your organization to a Lean culture What leaders must do to insure a successful Lean transformation Lean accounting practices that promote Lean behaviors The Lean rules for capital expenditure decision making How to identify and deal with Lean naysayers What and why to benchmark The kaizen rules for success The Lean formula for setting prices How to deploy strategy in a Lean environment And much moreGreat companies continuously, relentlessly improve everything they do to increase shareholder returns.

Summary
Cash is lying around everywhere in companies. It's piled to the
ceilings in warehouses and on shelves, hiding in plain sight as
inventory. It litters administrative offices, disguised as
incorrect invoices, late billings, incomplete forms, input errors,
sloppy requests from salespeople. It languishes in the countless
places a customer's order can hide as it crawls from order entry to
production and shipment. It sits in business's lobbies waiting for
sales calls to start.
All that cash is retrievable, gettable, bankable—available for
re-investment and dividends. Turn Waste into Wealth will help you
get that cash by becoming a Lean company.
Mark DeLuzio, principle architect of the vaunted Danaher
Business System that has led companies to world-class performance,
presents hard-hitting tips and numerous case histories that will
help you make your company Lean. You'll learn:
• Why Lean is the modern way to run any organization
• Eleven steps to transform your organization to a Lean
culture
• What leaders must do to insure a successful Lean
transformation
• Lean accounting practices that promote Lean behaviors
• The Lean rules for capital expenditure decision making
• How to identify and deal with Lean naysayers
• What and why to benchmark
• The kaizen rules for success
• The Lean formula for setting prices
• How to deploy strategy in a Lean environment
• And much more
Great companies continuously, relentlessly improve everything
they do to increase shareholder returns. Whether you're new to Lean
or already using Lean practices, Turn Waste into Wealth will help
you make your company great.

What
 is CE Marking (CE Mark)? 








What is CE Marking (CE Mark)? 
CE Marking is the symbol  as shown on the top of this
 page. The letters "CE" are the abbreviation of French phrase 
 "Conformité Européene" which literally means 
 "European Conformity". The term initially used was "EC Mark" and it was officially replaced by "CE Marking" in the Directive 93/68/EEC in 1993.  "CE Marking" is now used in all EU official documents.

"CE Mark" is also in use, but it is NOT the official term. For instance, in the Directive 2007/47/ec, of 5 September 2007, amending the directives 90/385/eec, 93/42/eec & 98/8/ec, the term CE Marking appears 9 times whereas CE Mark appears nowhere in the entire 35-page document.


CE Marking on a product is a manufacturer's declaration that the 
	product complies with the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation, in practice by many of the so-called Product Directives.*

*Product Directives   contains the "essential requirements" and/or 
"performance levels" and "Harmonized Standards" to 
which the products must conform. Harmonized Standards are the technical 
specifications (European Standards or Harmonization Documents) which are established by several European standards agencies
 (CEN, CENELEC, etc).
 CEN stands for European Committee for Standardization.
CENELEC stands for European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization. 

CE Marking on a product indicates to governmental officials that the product may be legally placed on the market in their country.
CE Marking on a product ensures the free movement of the product within the EFTA & European Union (EU) single market (including totally 30 EEA* countries), and
CE Marking on a product permits the withdrawal of the non-conforming products by EEA customs and enforcement/vigilance authorities.


* The European Economic Area (EEA):


The EEA includes EU countries and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and
Norway. It allows them to be part of the EEA single market.


Switzerland is a member of EFTA, but neither an EU nor EEA member. It however is still part of the single market.


Along with more directives' becoming effective, more and more products are required to bear the CE Marking for gaining access to the EFTA & European Union
market. However, many non-EU exporters are still unaware of or unsure about  this fact and its impact on their business.





General principles of the CE marking
The CE marking shall be affixed only by the manufacturer or his authorised representative.

The CE marking shall be affixed only to products to which its affixing is provided for by specific Community harmonisation legislation, and shall not be affixed to any other product.

By affixing or having affixed the CE marking, the manufacturer indicates that he takes responsibility for the conformity of the product with all applicable requirements set out in the relevant Community harmonisation legislation providing for its affixing.

The CE marking shall be the only marking which attests the conformity of the product with the applicable requirements of the relevant Community harmonisation legislation providing for its affixing.

The affixing to a product of markings, signs or inscriptions which are likely to mislead third parties regarding the meaning or form of the CE marking shall be prohibited. Any other marking may be affixed to the product provided that the visibility, legibility and meaning of the CE marking is not thereby impaired.

Member States shall ensure the correct implementation of the regime governing the CE marking and take appropriate action in the event of improper use of the marking. Member States shall also provide for penalties for infringements, which may include criminal sanctions for serious infringements. Those penalties shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and constitute an effective deterrent against improper use.
