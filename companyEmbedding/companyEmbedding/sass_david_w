A music lab has been developed to provide education and experimentation of many different hardware and software technologies.  Longer term, these labs will allow cross geographic education and music collaboration.  Many K-12 schools are cutting funding for music education  and the arts across the country.   More specifically,  computer music education has never been offered to this age group even though the technology has been available for years and is offered at many universities.  Many adults have never seen the capabilities of this technology and therefore don't know where to start.  Studies have shown that children who focus on music do better in school and score higher on tests.  They also gain self esteem and confidence while becoming more interested in math and science in school.  Digital music technologies can also motivate students to stick to practicing traditional instruments.  Music Art and Technology is providing programs for children and adults interested in learning music with digital technologies.  Many adults are interested in learning more about music but are intimidated with the vast array of technology available.  Our lab will allow them to select the best solution while learning it at their own pace.
