At KKR we are particularly proud of our global, integrated approach. We operate as one firm, leveraging all of our businesses and partnering across the firm on behalf of our fund investors and the companies in which we invest. KKR’s Private Equity platform invests in and partners with industry-leading franchises and companies poised for significant improvement or growth that attract high-quality management teams. Moreover, we are disciplined investors, focusing on long-term business fundamentals.
Working Together
We look to partner closely and cooperatively with management teams and entrepreneurs that have track records of success. We believe that the combination of our industry knowledge, investment experience, and operational expertise provides KKR with an edge in identifying and creating value in investment opportunities. Our strategy is not only to work as partners with the management of our portfolio companies, but also to assist in the operations of our businesses and leverage all of the resources of our global platform.
Ways We Invest
In addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as minority investments, and public toe hold investments where we can partner with public companies and leverage our industry expertise and operational capabilities.
Our Experience
Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 280 private equity investments in portfolio companies with approximately $542 billion of total entreprise value as of March 31, 2017.
On March 6, 2017, we announced the closing of our latest Americas Private Equity fund, KKR Americas XII Fund, a $13.9 billion fund focused on opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. More information can be found here.


On June 1, 2017, we announced the closing of our latest Asia Private Equity fund, KKR Asian Fund III, a $9.3 billion fund focused on investments in private equity transactions across the Asia Pacific region. More information can be found here.

KKR Income Opportunities Fund seeks to dynamically allocate across credit instruments to capitalize on changes in relative value among corporate credit investments and manage against macroeconomic risks. The Fund is designed to offer investors:

Investment experience of KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser, which is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a leading global investment firm with a 40-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence
Potential for attractive levels of current income through monthly distributions
A targeted portfolio investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities
KKR Credit's consistent approach and robust credit investment process that seeks to adapt credit strategies to market conditions

KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC serves as KKR Income Opportunities Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”). Launched in 2004, the Adviser is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with the Adviser and its other affiliates, “KKR”). The Adviser’s investment teams, which are organized by industry, invest across the capital structure with the goal of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns and protecting capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives of seeking a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation will be achieved or that the Fund’s investment program will be successful.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. The Fund’s investment policy of investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities, including special situations opportunities, involves certain risks. Investors could lose some or all of their investment.
The securities in which the Fund will invest may be rated below investment grade. Such securities are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to an issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal and are commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk” bonds.
For a summary of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, please see the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus. The Fund intends to use leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowings in an attempt to increase the return of an investment. The use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility and greater declines of the Fund’s net asset value, and fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the Fund. For additional risk information, see the “Leverage” section of the prospectus.
