November 11, 2009


Citigroup

Re: Tactical
Diversified Futures Fund L.P.


Ladies and
Gentlemen:


     Tactical
Diversified Futures Fund L.P. (formerly known as Citigroup
Diversified Futures Fund L.P.) (the “Partnership”) is
organized as a limited partnership under the New York Revised
Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended and in effect on the
date hereof (the “Partnership Act”) for the purpose of
speculative trading, either directly or indirectly, in commodity
interests including, but not limited to futures contracts, swaps,
options, spot, and forward contracts. Ceres Managed Futures LLC
(formerly known as Citigroup Managed Futures LLC), a Delaware
limited liability company (the “General Partner”),
offered units of limited partnership interest in the Partnership
(the “Units”) publicly from March 27, 2003 to
November 30, 2008 (the “Public Offering”). In
connection with the Public Offering, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
the Partnership and the General Partner were parties to a Second
Amended and Restated Selling Agreement dated as of October 2,
2004 (the “Selling Agreement”), which terminated
pursuant to its terms. No Units were sold between November 30,
2008 and the effective date of this Agreement as set forth in
Section 17.


     The General
Partner desires to raise additional capital for the Partnership by
the sale of Units to certain qualified investors pursuant to
Rule 506 of Regulation D (“Reg. D”) under
section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”). The General Partner, the
Partnership, the business of the Partnership and the Units are
described in a Private Placement Offering Memorandum and Disclosure
Document dated August 1, 2009, prepared by the General
Partner. As used in this Agreement, “Memorandum” refers
to that Private Placement Offering Memorandum and Disclosure
Document, including the appendices thereto, unless such memorandum
or appendices have been supplemented or amended, in which case the
term shall refer, from and after the time the supplement or
amendment is delivered to each of you, to the

 



 


memorandum and
appendices as so amended and supplemented. The commodity trading
advisors to the Partnership are currently AAA Capital Management
Advisors, Ltd., Aspect Capital Limited, Capital Fund Management
S.A., Drury Capital, Inc., Graham Capital Management, L.P., John W.
Henry & Company, Inc., SandRidge Capital, L.P., Willowbridge
Associates Inc. and Winton Capital Management Limited. The General
Partner may engage different commodity trading advisors from time
to time on behalf of the Partnership.


     The subscribers
for Units will be required to execute the Subscription Agreement, a
copy of which is attached as an appendix to the Memorandum, and to
tender or cause to be tendered for each Unit subscribed cash in the
amount of the net asset value per Unit on the date of purchase.
Subscribers for Units whose Subscription Agreements are accepted by
the General Partner will become limited partners of the Partnership
(the “Limited Partners”) upon the execution by the
General Partner as attorney-in-fact for each such subscriber of a
Limited Partnership Agreement, as may be amended and restated from
time to time, a copy of which is attached as an appendix to the
Memorandum (the “Partnership Agreement”), and at the
time such subscribers’ names are entered in the books and
records of the Partnership.


     Section 1.
Appointment of Agent .


     On the basis of
the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in it,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,
on behalf of its Smith Barney Channel, are hereby appointed
non-exclusive agents of the Partnership during the offering period
specified in this Section, for the purpose of finding subscribers
for the Units for the account and risk of the Partnership through a
private offering. The offering period will continue until the
General Partner terminates it (with reasonable advance notice) or
until up to 200,000 Units, or such additional duly authorized
amount, have been subscribed (the “Continuous
Offering”). Units or partial Units sold during the Continuous
Offering will be sold at net asset value per Unit as of the last
day of each month, provided that the General Partner may determine
to not accept any offers to purchase Units in a particular month.
Subject to the performance by the General Partner of all of its
obligations to be performed under this Agreement and to the
completeness and accuracy of all material representations and
warranties of the General Partner contained in this Agreement, you
each hereby accept such agency and agree on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement to use reasonable efforts
during the Continuous Offering to find subscribers for the Units
subject to market demand. Such offering of Units shall be subject
to prior approval in accordance with your internal policies. Each
of you agree that your agency under this Agreement, which is
coupled with an interest and, therefore, is not terminable by the
General Partner without your permission, will continue until the
termination of the Continuous Offering or until such time as all
Units sold by you have been redeemed, whichever is
later.


     Section 2.
Representations and Warranties of the Partnership and the
General Partner .


     The Partnership
and the General Partner jointly and severally represent and warrant
to each of you, individually, for your benefit, and for the benefit
of the purchasers of the Units sold by you that:

-2-



 


     (a) They will
deliver to you such number of copies of the Memorandum as you may
reasonably request, regardless of whether the Units are offered
solely to “accredited investors” as defined in Rule
501(a) of Reg. D. They will not make any amendment or supplement to
the Memorandum until they have given you a copy thereof and
reasonable notice of the same, and no such amendment or supplement,
if material, will be made if you reasonably object
thereto.


     (b) The
Memorandum complies with Rule 502(b)(2) of Reg. D and the
information to be made available or furnished to each purchaser of
a Unit pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof or otherwise will be
sufficient to comply with Rule 502(b)(2)(iv) and 502(b)(2)(v)
of Reg. D.


     (c) The
Memorandum will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.


     (d) All
action required under the Partnership Agreement or otherwise to be
taken by the General Partner before the subscription for and sale
of the Units to subscribers therefor has been taken or before the
Monthly Closing dates, as defined in Section 4 hereof, will
have been taken, and upon (i) payment of the consideration
therefor specified in the Subscription Agreement, (ii) acceptance
by the General Partner of each subscriber acceptable to the General
Partner, and (iii) the payment of any required filing fee, the
subscribers will become Limited Partners of the Partnership
entitled to all the rights of Limited Partners under the
Partnership Agreement and the Partnership Act. The Units, when sold
and paid for as contemplated by the Memorandum, will represent
validly authorized and duly issued limited partnership interests in
the Partnership and will conform to all statements relating thereto
contained in the Memorandum, including the Partnership Agreement.
The General Partner shall maintain records required of a registered
commodity pool operator pursuant to the rules of each of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
National Futures Association.


     (e) The
Partnership is a limited partnership duly and validly organized
pursuant to the Partnership Agreement and the laws of New York, and
is validly existing under, and subject to, the laws of New York
with full power and authority to conduct the business in which it
proposes to engage as described in the Memorandum. A Limited
Partner will have no liability in excess of his capital
contribution and his share of Partnership assets and undistributed
profits except as set forth in Section 7(f)(2) of the
Partnership Agreement and in the Partnership Act.


     (f) There is
no action, suit, litigation or proceeding before or by any court or
governmental agency, federal, state or local, pending or threatened
against or affecting or involving the property or business of the
General Partner, or the business of the Partnership, that would
materially and adversely affect the condition (financial or
otherwise), business or prospects of the General Partner or the
Partnership.


     (g) Other
than as disclosed to you, neither the Partnership, the General
Partner, nor any person directly or indirectly affiliated with
either of them has, either directly or through

an agent, sold
or offered for sale or solicited offers to subscribe for or buy, or
approached potential investors for or otherwise negotiated in
respect of, the Units except for the activities of the General
Partner in approaching potential investors undertaken in
cooperation with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney LLC, on behalf of its Smith Barney Channel, after
advance consultation with either Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, on behalf of its Smith Barney
Channel, as applicable; and neither the Partnership, the General
Partner nor any person directly or indirectly affiliated with any
of them has, either directly or through an agent, participated in
the organization or management of any partnership or other entity,
or has engaged in any other activity, in a manner or under
circumstances that would jeopardize the status of the offering of
the Units as an exempted transaction under the Securities Act or
under the laws of any state in which it is represented by the
General Partner that the offering may be made.


     (h) This
Agreement and the Partnership Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized, executed and delivered by and on behalf of the General
Partner and constitute valid and binding agreements of the General
Partner enforceable in accordance with their terms. This Agreement
and the Subscription Agreements have been or will be duly and
validly authorized, executed and delivered by and on behalf of the
Partnership and constitute or will constitute valid and binding
agreements of the Partnership enforceable in accordance with their
terms.


     (i) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Subscription
Agreements and the Partnership Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and in the
Memorandum, do not conflict with and will not constitute a breach
of, or default under, the certificate of formation or limited
liability company agreement of the General Partner or any agreement
or instrument by which the General Partner is bound by any order,
rule or regulation applicable to it of any court or any
governmental body or administrative agency having jurisdiction over
it.


     (j) A
separate escrow account has been opened at JPMorgan Chase Bank, New
York, New York (the “Escrow Agent”) and will be
maintained for all funds received from subscribers for Units. All
payments received from persons desiring to purchase Units will be
deposited in such account and held in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement entered into with the Escrow Agent. During the
Continuous Offering, the General Partner may elect to hold
subscription proceeds at a different bank. If the General Partner
elects to hold subscription proceeds at a different bank, it will
notify you promptly and provide you with details of the new
account.


     Section 3.
Representations and Warranties of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC .


     Each of you
represent and warrant, individually, to and for the benefit of the
Partnership and the General Partner that:


     (a) You will
not offer or sell the Units by any form of general solicitation or
general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Reg.
D.

-4-



 


     (b) Where
required by applicable state law or regulation, you will initiate
contact with a prospective offeree only after determining that the
suitability and sophistication standards described in the
Memorandum are likely to be satisfied with respect to such
prospective offeree and, where applicable, only after having
obtained an executed Purchaser Representative
Questionnaire.


     (c) You will
make offers to sell Units to, or solicit offers to subscribe for
Units from, persons in only those states or other jurisdictions
where the General Partner has either

If an individual or company (''agent'') agrees to act upon behalf of another organization or person (''the principal''), then an agency agreement is typically used. This document gives the agent the authority to act in the principal's interests. It also covers the nature of the relationship between the two parties, including information on when the agency agreement is terminated and responsibilities of the agent, plus compensation for the action.

Additional information that may be present in the document can include territory the agent may represent, trademark information, insurance protection and indemnification. If the agent were to incur expenses while acting as an agent, the agreement typically includes how they should be handled and other terms. Other topics one may include in the document are terms concerning records, taxes, warranties and state of governing law.

An agency agreement is a document that clearly states and defines the relationship between the parties, and protects both of their interests. Without drawing up the agreement, the agent may not be aware of the scope of their abilities. It is often used in the medical field, such as between a drug representative and the medication manufacturer.

TACTICAL DIVERSIFIED FUTURES FUND L.P. - S-1 - 20040709 - PROSPECTUS_SUMMARY








	SUMMARY OF THE PROSPECTUS





	Citigroup Diversified Futures Fund L.P. aims to achieve substantial capital appreciation and permit you
	to diversify a traditionally structured stock and bond portfolio.




	 




	The Fund
	attempts to accomplish its objectives through speculative trading in U.S. and international markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products and precious and base metals. The Fund may employ futures, options on
	futures and forward contracts in those markets.




	 




	Futures contracts entered into
	by the Fund are contracts made on an organized exchange which provide generally for the future delivery of various agricultural commodities, industrial commodities, foreign currencies or financial instruments in standard amounts at a specified date,
	time and place.




	 




	Options are contracts giving the purchaser the right, as
	opposed to the obligation, to acquire or to dispose of the commodity or commodity futures contract underlying the option. Options may be traded on exchanges or privately negotiated. The advisors currently do not trade options extensively, but may do
	so in the future.




	 




	Forward contracts are contracts for the purchase and sale of
	a commodity for delivery at a future date. Forward contracts are not traded on an exchange and contain terms and conditions specifically negotiated by the parties. The Fund enters into forward contracts on foreign currencies.




	 




	The Fund may also engage in trading in spot and swap contracts. Spot contracts are cash
	market transactions in which the buyer and seller agree to the immediate purchase and sale of a specific commodity, usually with a two-day settlement. Swap contracts generally involve an exchange of a stream of payments between the contracting
	parties. Swap and spot contracts are not uniform and are not exchange-traded.




	 




	The markets and contracts traded by the Fund are referred to collectively as commodity interests in this document. Exchange-traded futures and options are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Forward, spot and
	swap contracts are not regulated and do not receive the benefits of Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulation afforded to exchange-traded instruments.




	 




	Citigroup Managed Futures LLC is the Funds general partner. Aspect Capital Limited, Capital Fund Management S.A., Drury Capital, Inc., Graham Capital Management,
	L.P., John W. Henry & Company, Inc. and Willowbridge Associates Inc. have been selected by the general partner as the Funds trading advisors. Drury, Graham, John W. Henry and Willowbridge have traded for the Fund since inception. Aspect
	and Capital Fund Management began trading for the Fund on January 1, 2004. The advisors will not trade for the Fund for any specified period of time. All of the Funds assets will be deposited with Citigroup Global Markets, the Funds
	commodity broker.




	 




	The general partner, in its sole discretion, may invest the
	Funds assets in other commodity pools advised by any advisor to the Fund.




	 




	The Funds address is: c/o Citigroup Managed Futures LLC, 399 Park Avenue, 7



	th



	Floor, New York, New
	York 10022.




	 




	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. government
	agency that regulates the futures markets and the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory membership organization, are referred to throughout this document as CFTC and NFA, respectively.




	 







	Investing in the Fund





	 






	Investment Minimums






	 




	The minimum initial investment is $5,000, unless you are investing
	for an IRA or other




	 




	 




	1







	Table of Contents




	employee benefit plan account, in which case the minimum is $2,000. Investments above the minimum and subsequent investments must be in $1,000 increments.




	 






	Is an investment in the Fund suitable for you?






	 




	You should consider investing in the Fund if you are interested in its potential to produce,
	over the long-term, returns that are generally independent of the returns of stocks and bonds and you are prepared to risk the loss of all of your investment.




	 




	An investment in the Fund is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. The Fund is not a complete investment nor is it suitable for all investors. The Fund is
	not suitable for investors seeking consistent returns, income or tax benefits.




	 




	The Fund is offered as a diversification opportunity for an investors entire portfolio and therefore an investment in the Fund should represent only a limited portion of an investors overall portfolio.




	 




	At a minimum you must have:




	 






	 




	(1)




	a net worth of at least $150,000, exclusive of home, furnishings and automobiles; or






	 






	 




	(2)




	a net worth, similarly calculated, of at least $45,000 and an annual gross income of at least $45,000.






	 




	A number of states in which the units are offered impose higher minimum financial standards on prospective investors. These standards are,
	in each case, only regulatory minimums. Merely because you meet the standards does not mean the investment is suitable for you. See Exhibit C for suitability requirements.




	 




	Your Smith Barney financial consultant can assist you in deciding whether an investment in the Fund is suitable for you.




	 






	How to Invest






	 






	 




	




	Read this prospectus carefully and discuss with your financial consultant any questions you have about the Fund.






	 






	 




	




	If you decide to invest, please complete and sign the subscription agreement on the last page.






	 






	 




	




	The Fund will accept subscriptions monthly throughout the continuous offering, which will end on the earlier of the second anniversary of the date of this prospectus or the date on
	which an aggregate of 2,000,000 units are sold, unless the general partner terminates the offering at an earlier date. The offering can be terminated by the general partner at any time. Your subscription amount will be held on your behalf in an
	escrow account until it is returned to you or invested in the Fund.






	 






	 




	




	You may buy units and partial units at the beginning of any month in which units are offered. The number of units you receive will be based on the net asset value of the units on
	the purchase date. The net asset value per unit is determined by dividing the total net asset value of the Fund by the number of units issued. Net asset value is all of the Funds assets including the market value of commodity interest
	contracts less brokerage and advisory fees and all other liabilities of the Fund. You must submit your signed subscription agreement and your subscription amount at least five days before the end of the prior month.






	 






	 




	




	You must have a Smith Barney customer securities account to buy units.






	 






	 




	




	Interest earned while subscriptions are in the escrow account will be credited to your Smith Barney securities account.






	 







	Summary of Risks You Should Consider Before Investing in the Fund





	 




	Investment in the Fund is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should be aware of the following risks:




	 






	 




	




	The trading of commodity interests is speculative, volatile and involves a high






	 




	 




	2







	Table of Contents






	 





	degree of leverage. A small change in the market price of a contract can produce major losses for the Fund.







	 






	 




	




	You could lose all of your investment.






	 






	 




	




	Regardless of its trading performance, the Fund will incur fees and expenses, including brokerage and management fees. Substantial incentive fees may be paid to one or more of the
	trading advisors even if the Fund experiences a net loss for the full year.






	 






	 




	




	Your ability to redeem units is limited and no market exists for the units. You may redeem units only after an initial three-month holding period and then only on a monthly basis.






	 






	 




	




	The Fund is subject to numerous conflicts of interest including those that arise from the facts that:






	 






	 




	(1)




	the general partner and commodity broker are affiliates;






	 






	 




	(2)




	each of the trading advisors, the commodity broker and their principals and affiliates may trade in commodity interests for their own accounts; and






	 






	 




	(3)




	your Smith Barney financial consultant will receive ongoing compensation for providing services to your account.






	 






	 




	




	The Fund will not provide any benefit of diversification of your overall portfolio unless it is profitable and produces returns that are independent from stock and bond market
	returns.






	 






	 




	




	The advisors trading strategies may not perform as they have performed in the past. The advisors have from time to time incurred substantial losses in trading on behalf of
	clients.






	 






	 




	




	The Fund has a limited operating history.






	 






	 




	




	You will be taxed on your share of the Funds income, even though the Fund does not intend to make any distributions.








	 




	




	The general partner at any time may select and allocate the Funds assets to advisors that are not described in this prospectus. You may not be advised of such changes in
	advance. You must rely on the ability of the general partner to select advisors and allocate assets among them.






	 




	See pages


	9 through


	15 for a complete description of risks of this investment.




	 







	Investment Factors You Should Consider Before Investing in the Fund





	 






	 




	




	The Fund trades a diversified portfolio of commodity interests in U.S. and international markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products and
	precious and base metals.






	 






	 




	




	The general partner has selected multiple advisors who use proprietary trading systems for the Fund in an attempt to make profits and protect against losses.






	 






	 




	




	The Fund may diversify a stock and bond portfolio by producing positive returns that are independent of stock and bond markets. Due to its trading in global futures markets and the
	ability of the advisors to take both long and short positions with equal ease, the Fund may produce independent returns. The potential result of these independent returns would be to improve the return of the overall portfolio and lower its
	volatility.






	 






	 




	




	As an investor in the Fund you will have the advantage of highly leveraged trading in a limited liability structure which ensures that you will not be individually subject to margin
	calls or demands for cash with respect to the Funds account. While it is possible in theory to lose your entire investment, the general partner has more than 20 years of experience in managing commodity pools and carefully monitors
	pre-established loss limits for each pool.






	 




	 




	3







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	Citigroup Global Markets will pay the Fund interest on 80% of the average daily balance maintained in cash in the Funds commodity trading accounts at a 30-day U.S. Treasury
	bill rate and/or will place up to all of the Funds assets in 90-day Treasury bills and pay the Fund 80% of the interest earned on the Treasury bills purchased. Other commodity funds typically also earn interest on cash balances. Small
	individual commodity trading accounts often do not earn interest.






	 






	 




	




	The Fund provides you with services designed to simplify the administrative details involved in engaging directly in commodity interest transactions, such as posting margin (the
	good faith deposit needed to maintain a futures contract position) and responding to margin calls (requests from the commodity broker for additional margin amounts), monitoring positions and tracking performance daily.






	 







	General Partner





	 




	Citigroup Managed Futures LLC
	manages the Fund. Its duties include, among others, selecting, monitoring and terminating advisors and allocating assets among them. In making allocations, the general partner considers past performance, trading style, volatility, markets traded and
	fee requirements. The general partner and its predecessor firms were incorporated in 1979 and have sponsored or supervised cumulative assets of over $3 billion in the past 20 years. As of May 31, 2004, the general partner acted as general partner or
	trading manager to 24 active pools: eight public, ten private and six offshore pools with assets of approximately $2.1 billion.




	 







	Trading Advisors for the Fund





	 




	The Fund employs six
	advisors to trade the Funds assets. The allocation of Fund assets to each advisor as of May 31, 2004 was as follows: Aspect (17.92%); CFM (19.59%); Drury


	(17.79%); Graham (14.71%); JWH (14.55%); and
	Willowbridge (15.44%). The Fund is a multi-advisor pool under CFTC rules. Each of the advisors has developed and employs proprietary strategies.




	 




	Aspect, CFM, Drury, Graham, JWH


	®






	and Willowbridge will generally use computerized trading strategies based on technical, rather than fundamental analysis of market prices.




	 




	Technical analysis focuses primarily on statistical research of past market prices. One of
	the most common trading strategies that uses technical analysis is trend-following. Fundamental analysis applies the theory that prices are primarily determined by the economic forces of supply and demand. Future advisors may employ fundamental
	analysis.




	 




	When used below, nominal account size means the dollar
	amount that an advisor and its client have agreed in writing will determine the level of trading in the clients account regardless of the amount of actual funds on deposit with the futures commission merchant. An account with a nominal account
	size greater than its actual funds is referred to as a partially funded account.




	 






	Aspect Capital Limited






	 




	Aspect
	Capital Limited has been registered as a commodity trading advisor since October 1999. Aspect will trade its Diversified Program for the Fund. The Diversified Program continuously monitors price movements in approximately 100 global markets in
	currencies, energy, metals, stock indices, interest rate products, and agricultural commodities. Aspect began trading the Diversified Program on behalf of client accounts in December 1998. As of April 30, 2004, Aspect managed approximately
	$2.1 billion in the Diversified Program and $3.8 billion in total assets (including the nominal account size of any partially funded accounts).




	 






	Capital Fund Management S.A.






	 




	Capital Fund Management S.A. has been registered as a commodity trading advisor since May 1992. CFM will trade its Discus Program




	 




	 




	4







	Table of Contents




	on behalf of the Fund. The Discus Program trades a diversified portfolio of approximately 50 futures and forward contracts among the following sectors:
	short, medium and long term interest rates, stock indices, currencies and commodities. The Discus Program is a multi-strategy, 100% statistical and systematic program that seeks to identify prevailing market conditions and adopt the most efficient
	trading strategy for those conditions. The strategy at times follows medium to long term trends, and at other times establishes short term positions in the direction of or opposite a trend. As of April 30, 2004, CFM managed approximately $390
	million in total futures trading related assets (including the nominal account size of any partially funded accounts), all of which are traded pursuant to the Discus Program or a derivative of the Discus Program that uses greater leverage and is
	traded on behalf of another pool operated by the general partner.




	 






	Drury
	Capital, Inc.






	 




	Drury Capital, Inc. has been registered as a commodity
	trading advisor since August 1992. Mr. Bernard Drury initially founded Drury in order to trade a fundamentally oriented grain trading program. In 1997, Mr. Drury began trading client assets in the Drury Diversified Trend-Following Program, a
	stand-alone technical trend-following system which Drury trades for the Fund. The program is built on elements of trend-following and diversification. The program emphasizes diversification by trading metals, agricultural products, foreign exchange,
	stock index futures, energy products, financial instruments and tropical products (softs). As of April 30, 2004, Drury managed approximately $484 million in total assets (including the nominal account size of any partially funded accounts). All such
	assets are managed in the Diversified Trend-Following Program.




	 






	Graham
	Capital Management, L.P.






	 




	Graham Capital Management, L.P. became
	registered as a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator in July 1994. Graham


	trades its K4 Program at 150% Leverage for the Fund. The strategies utilized are systematic and primarily
	long-term in nature and are intended to exploit directional moves in over 60 markets over time, with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility. The K4 Program at 150% Leverage trades in financials including currencies, interest rates and stock
	indices and nonfinancials including energy, metals and agricultural products. As of April 30, 2004, Graham managed approximately $1.5 billion in its K4 Program at 150% Leverage and approximately $5.8 billion in total assets (including the nominal
	account size of any partially funded accounts).




	 






	John W. Henry &
	Company, Inc.






	 




	John W. Henry & Company, Inc. has been registered
	as a commodity trading advisor since 1982. JWH utilizes its GlobalAnalytics


	®






	Program in its management of the assets allocated to it by the Fund. The GlobalAnalytics Program uses JWHs five-phase investment style which is a combination of JWHs two-phase style (a position is
	maintained, long or short, in a market at all times) and JWHs three-phase style (positions are taken when trends are identified, but the program may take a neutral stance or liquidate open positions in non- trending markets). The program
	invests in a broad spectrum of worldwide financial and non-financial markets, including interest rate, non-U.S. stock index, currency, metals, energy and agricultural contracts. As of April 30, 2004, JWH managed approximately $220 million in its
	GlobalAnalytics Program and approximately $2.3 billion in total assets.




	 






	Willowbridge Associates Inc.






	 




	Willowbridge Associates
	Inc. has been registered as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor since 1988. Willowbridge utilizes its Select Investment Program using the Argo Trading System for assets allocated to it by the Fund. The Select Investment Program
	using the Argo Trading System is akin to a systematic technical charting




	 




	 




	5







	Table of Contents




	system. Its focus is primarily on major long-term price moves. Argos positions are generally held from 20 to 30 trading days. The Argo Trading System
	trades a diversified portfolio of commodity interests in agricultural commodities, energy, precious metals, financial


	instruments and foreign currency markets. As of April 30, 2004, Willowbridge managed
	approximately $493 million in its Argo Trading System and approximately $968 million in total assets (including the nominal account size of any partially funded accounts).

	Other Operating Expenses





	  




	 








	Reimbursement of offering and organizational expenses of the initial offering period






	  




	Actual expenses estimated at $650,000 together with interest reimbursed to Citigroup Global Markets in 36 monthly installments. As of May 31, 2004, $425,064 (exclusive of interest charges)
	remained to be reimbursed.








	Expenses of the continuous offering






	  





	Actual expenses estimated at $500,000 per year. At a Fund size of $551 million, this would equal 0.09% of the Funds net assets; at a Fund
	size of $2 billion, this would equal 0.03% of net assets.




	Caps on these fees are higher. Please see page 23.









	Ongoing expenses: periodic legal, accounting, filing and reporting fees






	  




	Actual expenses estimated at $150,000 per year. At a Fund size of $551 million, this would equal 0.03% of the Funds net assets; at a Fund size of $2 billion, this would equal 0.01%
	of net assets.

	Break-even Threshold





	 




	At a Fund size of $551 million
	(the approximate size of the Fund as of May 31, 2004), an investment of $5,000 must earn profits of $383.45 (7.67%) in order to break-even at the end of one year of trading.




	 







	Redemptions





	 




	You may redeem your units as of the end
	of any month after a three-month initial holding period. You must give notice to the general partner at least 10 days before the end of the month in which you wish to redeem. Because the net asset value of your units can vary significantly from day
	to day, you cannot know the redemption value of your investment at the time you submit your request to redeem. The Fund will not redeem or may delay redemption of units, if the Fund does not have enough cash available to pay the redemption or if a
	limited partner would own fewer than three units after redemption.




	 







	An Investment in the Fund Should Be Considered at Least a Two-Year Commitment





	 




	The market conditions in which the Fund has the best opportunity to recognize significant profits occur infrequently. Therefore, you should plan to hold units for long enough to have a realistic


	opportunity for a number of sustained price movements to develop. The general partner believes you should consider your investment in units to be at least a two-year commitment.




	 







	Distributions





	 




	The general partner does not
	currently intend to make any distributions from the Fund.




	 




	If the Fund is
	profitable, you will earn money on your investment through appreciation in the value of your units.

Item 7.



 



Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.




Overview

     The
Partnership aims to achieve substantial capital appreciation and
permit investors to diversify a traditionally structured stock and
bond portfolio. The Partnership attempts to accomplish its
objectives through speculative trading in U.S. and international
markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural
and energy products and precious and base metals directly, or
through investments in the Funds. The Partnership may employ
futures, swaps, options on futures, and forward contracts in those
markets.

     The
General Partner manages all business of the Partnership/Funds. The
General Partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment
of the Partnership’s assets to the Advisors. The General
Partner employs a team of approximately 20 professionals whose
primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among
the Advisors to the partnerships operated or managed by the General
Partner. A full-time staff of due diligence professionals use
state-of-the-art technology and on-site evaluations to monitor new
and existing futures money managers. The accounting and operations
staff provide processing of trading activity and reporting to
limited partners and regulatory authorities. In selecting the
Advisors for the Partnership, the General Partner considered past
performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee
requirements.

     Responsibilities
of the General Partner include:

 




 



•



 



due
diligence examinations of the Advisors;





 



 





 



•



 



selection,
appointment and termination of the Advisors;





 



 





 



•



 



negotiation
of the management agreements; and





 



 





 



•



 



monitoring
the activity of the Advisors.




     In
addition, the General Partner prepares the books and records and
provides the administrative and compliance services that are
required by law or regulation from time to time in connection with
the operation of the Partnership. These services include the
preparation of required books and records and reports to limited
partners, government agencies and regulators; computation of net
asset value; calculation of fees; effecting subscriptions,
redemptions and limited partner communications; and preparation of
offering documents and sales literature.

     The
General Partner seeks the best prices and services available in its
commodity futures brokerage transactions.

     The
programs traded by each Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are:
Drury — Diversified Trend-Following Program, Graham —
K4D-12.5 Program (“K4D”), JWH — Global Analytics
Program, Aspect — Diversified Program, CFM — Discus
Program, Winton — Diversified Program, AAA — Energy
Program — Futures and Swaps (“Energy”),
Willowbridge — Argo Trading System (“Argo”) and
SandRidge — Energy Program. As of December 31, 2009, the
Partnership’s assets were allocated among the Advisors in the
following approximate percentages: Drury 11%, Graham 11%, JWH 5%,
Aspect 13%, CFM 19%, Winton 12%, AAA 10%, Willowbridge 9% and
SandRidge 10%. The General Partner may modify or terminate the
allocation of assets among trading advisors at any time and may
allocate assets to additional advisors at any time.

Drury
Capital, Inc.

     Drury
trades its Diversified Trend-Following Program on behalf of Drury
Master. The Diversified Trend-Following program is systematic and
technical. Drury may exercise judgment regarding liquidity issues.
Systematic traders rely primarily on trading programs or models
that generate trading signals. The systems utilized to generate
trading signals are changed from time to time (although generally
infrequently), but the trading instructions generated by the system
being used are followed without significant additional analysis or
interpretation.

     The
Diversified Trend-Following Program is built on elements of
trend-following and diversification. The program emphasizes
diversification by trading metals, agricultural products, foreign
exchange, stock indices, energy products, financial instruments and
tropical products (softs).

     The
Diversified Trend-Following Program trades 30 portfolio instruments
and is generally positioned in 18 of these instruments on average.
Positions can be short as well as long. The Diversified
Trend-Following Program has no market or sector bias, as Drury
believes that each instrument can produce long-term profits through
the application of independent technical analysis and risk
management.

     
Graham Capital Management, L.P.

     Graham
trades its K4D program on behalf of Graham Master. As of
December 31, 2009, the K4D program consisted of the Global
Diversified Program and the K4 Program. The Global Diversified
Program employs a systematic strategy that utilizes multiple
computerized trading models and offers broad diversification across
various global markets. The K4 Program employs a systematic
strategy that utilizes a mathematical model to identify certain
price patterns that indicate a high probability that a significant
directional move will occur.

     Graham
trades actively in both U.S. and foreign markets, primarily in
futures contracts, forward contracts, spot contracts and associated
derivative instruments such as options and swaps. Graham engages in
exchange for physical transactions, which involve the exchange of a
futures position for the underlying physical commodity without
making an open competitive trade on an exchange. Graham at times
will trade certain instruments, such as forward foreign currency
contracts, as a substitute for futures or options traded on futures
exchanges.

     Graham’s
trading systems are systematic and rely primarily on technical
rather than fundamental information as the basis for their trading
decisions. Graham’s systems are based on the expectation that
they can over time successfully anticipate market events using
quantitative mathematical models to determine their trading
activities, as opposed to attempting properly to forecast price
trends using subjective analysis of supply and demand.

     
John W. Henry & Company, Inc.

     JWH
trades its JWH Global Analytics Program on behalf of the
Partnership, a systematic trading program. Since the firm’s
inception, the JWH investment philosophy has been based on the
premise that market prices, rather than market fundamentals, are
the key aggregators of information necessary to make investment
decisions and that market prices, which may at first seem random,
are actually related through time in complex, but discernable
ways.

     Global
Analytics invests in both long- and short-term price movements. The
program invests in a broad spectrum of worldwide financial and
non-financial markets, including interest rate, non-U.S. stock
index, currency, metals, energy and agricultural contracts.
GlobalAnalytics uses JWH’s five phase investment style (a
position is maintained, long or short, in a market at all times)
and JWH’s three phase investment style (positions are taken
when trends are identified, but the program may take a neutral
stance or liquidate open positions in non-trending
markets).

Willowbridge
Associates Inc.

     Willowbridge
trades its Select Investment Program using the Argo Trading System
on behalf of Willowbridge Master. Argo is a computerized systematic
trading system that relies on technical information. It is not a
trend-following system, but does follow a trend when the
opportunity arises. Argo uses the concepts of pattern recognition,
support/resistance levels and counter trend liquidations in making
trading decisions. Argo determines, on a daily basis, whether to be
long, short or flat the various commodities in its
portfolio.

     Pattern
recognition, support/resistance levels and counter-trend
liquidations are defined as follows:

     Pattern
recognition is the ability to identify patterns that appear to have
acted as precursors of price advances or declines in the
past.

     A
support level is a previous low—a price level under the
current market price at which point buying interest is expected to
be sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure.

     A
resistance level is a previous high—a price level over the
current market price at which point selling pressure is expected to
overcome buying pressure and a price advance is expected to be
turned back.

     A
counter-trend liquidation is the closing out of a position after a
significant price move on the assumption that the market is due for
a correction.

     
Aspect Capital Limited.

     Aspect
trades its Diversified Program on behalf of Aspect Master. The
Diversified Program is a systematic global futures trading program.
Its goal is the generation of significant long-term capital growth
independent of stock and bond market returns. This program
continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global
financial, currency and commodity markets, searching for profit
opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several
months.

     Aspect
has designed the Diversified Program to have broad market
diversification (subject to liquidity constraints). Aspect’s
quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and
implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant
allocation to numerous different markets.

     Aspect’s
Diversified Program trades over 100 markets in the seven major
sectors: currencies, energy, metals, stock indices, bonds,
agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum
strategies. Aspect is constantly examining new liquid and
uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of
improving its reward/risk ratio and capacity. Aspect has no market
or sector preferences, believing that allowing for liquidity
effects, equal profitability can be achieved in the long-term in
all markets. The key factors in determining the asset allocation
are correlation and liquidity. Correlations are analyzed at the
sector, sub-sector, economic block and market levels to design a
portfolio which is highly diversified.

     
Capital Fund Management S.A.

     CFM
trades its Discus Program on behalf of the Partnership. The Discus
Program is a multi-strategy, 100% statistical and systematic
program that seeks to identify prevailing market conditions and
adopt the most efficient trading strategy for those conditions. The
strategy at times follows medium to long term trends, and at other
times establishes short term positions in the direction of or
opposite a trend.

     CFM
has designed the Discus Program to trade a diversified portfolio of
approximately 50 futures and forward contracts among the following
sectors: short, medium and long term interest rates, stock indices,
currencies and commodities.

     
Winton Capital Management Limited.

     Winton
trades its Diversified Program on behalf of Winton Master. The
Diversified Program trades approximately 95 futures and forward
contracts on United States and non- United States exchanges and
markets.

     Winton
employs a fully systematic, computerized, technical,
trend-following trading system developed by its principals. This
system tracks the daily price movements from these markets around
the world, and carries out certain computations to determine each
day how long

 3

 

 

  

 

or short
the portfolio should be in an attempt to maximize profit within a
certain range of risk. If rising prices in a particular market are
anticipated, a long position will be established in that market; if
prices in a particular market are expected to fall, a short
position in that market will be established.

     Technical
analysis refers to analysis based on data intrinsic to a market,
such as price and volume. In contrast, fundamental analysis relies
on factors external to a market, such as supply and demand. The
Diversified Program employs no fundamental factors.

     A
trend-following system is one that attempts to take advantage of
the observable tendency of the markets to trend, and to tend to
make exaggerated movements in both upward and downward directions
as a result of such trends. These exaggerated movements are largely
explained as a result of the influence of crowd psychology or the
“herd instinct” among market participants.

     A
trend-following system does not anticipate a trend. In fact,
trend-following systems are frequently unprofitable for long
periods of time in particular markets or market groups, and
occasionally they are unprofitable for periods of more than a year.
However, the principals believe that such an approach will, in the
long term, be profitable.

     Trade
selection is not subject to intervention by Winton’s
principals and therefore is not subject to the influences of
individual judgment. As a mechanical trading system, the Winton
model embodies all the expert knowledge required to analyze market
data and direct trades, thus eliminating the risk of basing a
trading program on one indispensable person. Equally as important
is the fact that mechanical systems can be tested in simulation for
long periods of time and the model’s empirical
characteristics can be measured.

     The
system’s output is rigorously adhered to in trading the
portfolio and intentionally no importance is given to any external
or fundamental factors. While it may be seen as unwise to ignore
information of obvious value, such as that pertaining to political
or economic developments, Winton believes that the disadvantage of
this approach is far outweighed by the advantage of the discipline
that rigorous adherence to such a system instills. Winton believes
that significant profits may be realized by the Winton system by
holding on to positions for much longer than conventional wisdom
would dictate. Winton believes that a trader who pays attention to
day-to-day events could be distracted from the chance of fully
capitalizing on such trends.

     The
Winton system trades in all liquid U.S. and non-U.S. futures and
forward contracts. Forward markets include major currencies and
precious and base metals, the latter two categories being traded on
the London Metal Exchange. Winton seeks out new opportunities to
add additional markets to the portfolio, with the goal of
increasing the portfolio’s diversification.

     Winton
believes that taking positions in a variety of unrelated markets
will, over time, decrease system volatility. By employing a
sophisticated and systematic method for placing orders in a wide
array of markets, Winton believes that profits can be realized over
time.

     
AAA Capital Management Adviors, Ltd.

     AAA
trades its Energy Program on behalf of AAA Master, and thereby the
Partnership’s, assets in accordance with its Energy Program
— Futures and Swaps, a discretionary trading
program.

     AAA
Master currently trades energy futures contracts and options on
energy futures contracts on domestic and international exchanges,
as well as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (an index future
comprised of energy and other products) traded on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. AAA Master also currently engages in swap
transactions involving crude oil and other energy related products.
References herein to energy and energy related products include all
of the foregoing.

     AAA
generally bases its trading decisions on “fundamental”
factors, namely supply and demand for a particular group or type of
commodity. AAA attempts to buy undervalued commodities and sell
overvalued commodities, often but not always simultaneously. AAA
uses options to attempt either to reduce or define
risks.

     AAA
is aware of price trends but does not trade upon trends. AAA often
takes profits in positions with specific trends even though that
trend may still be intact or perhaps even strong. AAA occasionally
establishes positions that are countertrend.

     Effective
risk management is a crucial aspect of AAA’s trading program.
Account size, expectation, volatility of the market traded and the
nature of other positions taken are all factors in determining the
amount of equity committed to each trade. AAA Master is AAA’s
largest account.

SandRidge Capital, L.P.

     SandRidge
trades the Partnership’s assets in accordance with its Energy
Program. SandRidge primarily attempts to achieve the
Partnership’s objective through the speculative trading of
energy-related commodity interests, including, but not limited to,
natural gas, crude oil, heating oil and gasoline. With the prior
approval of the General Partner, SandRidge may trade in other
commodity interests that are now traded, or may be traded in the
future, on exchanges and markets located in the United States and
abroad.

     SandRidge
is a discretionary trader that employs primarily fundamental
analysis. Fundamental analysis examines factors external to the
trading market that affect the supply and demand for a particular
group or type of commodity in order to predict future prices.
Effective risk management is an important aspect of
SandRidge’s trading program. An account’s size,
volatility of the market traded and the nature of other positions
taken are all factors used in deciding whether to initiate a
position and in determining the amount of equity committed to that
position. While SandRidge relies heavily on fundamental research to
develop its overall point of view, it also employs technical
analysis in its trading to help determine entry and exit points.
Technical analysis includes moving averages, index rolls and
Stochastic/relative strength indicators. Technical analysis is
based on the theory that the study of the markets themselves
provides a means of anticipating price movements. SandRidge may
employ various strategies for phasing an account in and out of the
markets. Entry points are based on a number of price breakout and
retracement indicators. Position exits are based on multiple
strategies including trailing stops, target prices and technical
reversals. If SandRidge believes that the markets traded are
unstable, SandRidge may temporarily reduce positions or exit the
markets entirely and therefore hold no open positions for a period
of time. SandRidge estimates that, generally, 10% to 15% of the
Partnership’s assets allocated to SandRidge will be committed
to margin at any one time. The actual amount committed as such may
be substantially more. Trading decisions will require the exercise
of judgment by SandRidge.

     SandRidge’s
success depends to a great extent upon the occurrence of market
conditions favorable to its trading strategy. Factors such as lack
of major price trends or increased governmental control of, or
participation in, the markets, may reduce SandRidge’s ability
to trade profitably in the future.

     No
assurance can be given that the Advisors’ strategies will be
successful or that they will generate profits for the
Partnership.

     For
the period January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, the
average allocation by commodity market sector for each of the Funds
was as follows:

     (a) 
Liquidity.

     The
Partnership does not engage in the sales of goods or services. The
Partnership’s assets are its (i) investment in
partnerships, (ii) equity in its trading account, consisting
of cash and cash equivalents, net unrealized appreciation on open
futures contracts, and (iii) interest receivable. Because of
the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures
trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial
losses to the Partnership. While substantial losses could lead to a
material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during
the year ended December 31, 2009.

     To
minimize this risk relating to low margin deposits, the Partnership
follows certain trading policies, including:

 




 



(i)



 



The
Partnership/Funds invests their assets only in commodity interests
that the Advisors believes are traded in sufficient volume to
permit ease of taking and liquidating positions. Sufficient volume,
in this context, refers to a level of liquidity that the Advisor
believes will permit it to enter and exit trades without noticeably
moving the market.





 



 





 



(ii)



 



An Advisor
will not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these
positions would result in aggregate positions requiring a margin of
more than 66 2/3% of the Partnership’s net assets allocated
to that Advisor.





 



 





 



(iii)



 



The
Partnership/Funds may occasionally accept delivery of a commodity.
Unless such delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering the
warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate
clearinghouse, the physical commodity position is fully
hedged.





 



 





 



(iv)



 



The
Partnership/Funds do not employ the trading technique commonly
known as “pyramiding,” in which the speculator uses
unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the
purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related
commodities.





 



 





 



(v)



 



The
Partnership/Funds do not utilize borrowings other than short-term
borrowings if the Partnership/Funds take delivery of any cash
commodities.




 5

 

 

  

 

 




 



(vi)



 



The
Advisors may, from time to time, employ trading strategies such as
spreads or straddles on behalf of the Partnership/Funds. The term
“spread” or “straddle” describes a
commodity futures trading strategy involving the simultaneous
buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but
involving different delivery dates or markets and in which the
trader expects to earn a profit from a widening or narrowing of the
difference between the prices of the two contracts.





 



 





 



(vii)



 



The
Partnership/Funds will not permit the churning of its commodity
trading account. The term “churning” refers to the
practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency
unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades, driven
by the desire to generate commission income.




     From
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, the Partnership’s
average margin to equity ratio (i.e., the percentage of assets on
deposit required for margin) was approximately 11.2%. The foregoing
margin to equity ratio takes into account cash held in the
Partnership’s name, as well as the allocable value of the
positions and cash held on behalf of the Partnership in the name of
the Funds.

     In
the normal course of business, the Partnership and the Funds are
parties to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk,
including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments. These financial instruments include forwards, futures,
options and swaps, whose values are based upon an underlying asset,
index or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments
to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell
other financial instruments at specified terms at specified future
dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have
a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical
delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments
may be traded on an exchange or over-the-counter
(“OTC”). Exchange traded instruments are standardized
and include futures and certain forwards and option contracts. OTC
contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include
swaps and certain forwards and option contracts. Each of these
instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating
to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit
risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are
greater than those associated with exchange traded instruments
because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an
OTC contract.

     Market
risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial
instruments traded by the Partnership/Funds due to market changes,
including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and
fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is
directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in
which the related underlying assets are traded. The
Partnership/Funds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value
of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability
on such contracts sold short.

     Credit
risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of
a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The
Partnership’s/Funds’ risk of loss in the event of a
counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized
in the Statements of Financial Condition and not represented by the
contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The
Partnership’s/Funds’ risk of loss is reduced through
the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with
counterparties that permit the Partnership/Funds to offset
unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with
such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The
Partnership/Funds have credit risk and concentration risk as the
sole counterparty or broker with respect to the
Partnership’s/Funds’ assets is CGM or a CGM affiliate.
Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced
to the extent that through CGM, the
Partnership’s/Funds’ counterparty is an exchange or
clearing organization.

     As
both a buyer and seller of options, the Funds pay or receive a
premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes
in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options
expose the Funds to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased
options the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid. Certain
written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the
option holder to own the reference asset. The Funds do not consider
these contracts to be guarantees as described in ASC 460,
Guarantees (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees”).

     The
General Partner/managing member monitors and attempts to control
the Partnership’s/Funds’ risk exposure on a daily basis
through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems,
and accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for
evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the
Partnership/Funds may be subject. These monitoring systems
generally allow the General Partner to statistically analyze actual
trading results with risk adjusted performance indicators and
correlation statistics. In addition, on-line monitoring systems
provide account analysis of futures, forwards and options positions
by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and
collateral positions. (See also “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further
information on financial instrument risk included in the notes to
financial statements.)

     Other
than the risks inherent in commodity futures and other derivatives
trading, the Partnership knows of no trends, demands, commitments,
events or uncertainties which will result in or which are
reasonably likely to

TACTICAL DIVERSIFIED FUTURES FUND L.P. - 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(Edgar Glimpses Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) Overview

The Partnership, directly and through its investment in the Funds, aims to
achieve substantial capital appreciation and permit investors to diversify a
traditionally structured stock and bond portfolio. The Partnership attempts to
accomplish its objectives through speculative trading in U.S. and international
markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy
products and precious and base metals directly, or through investments in the
Funds. The Partnership may employ futures, swaps, options on futures, and
forward contracts in those markets.



 


The General Partner manages all business of the Partnership/Funds. The General
Partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the Partnership's
assets to the Advisors. The General Partner employs a team of approximately 37
professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality
control among the Advisors to the funds operated or managed by the General
Partner. A full-time staff of due diligence professionals use state-of-the-art
technology and on-site evaluations to monitor new and existing futures money
managers. The accounting and operations staff provides processing of
subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory
authorities. The General Partner also includes staff involved in marketing and
sales support. In selecting the Advisors for the Partnership, the General
Partner considered past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded
and fee requirements.

Responsibilities of the General Partner include:

 • due diligence examinations of the Advisors;

 • selection, appointment and termination of the Advisors;

 • negotiation of the management agreements; and

 • monitoring the activity of the Advisors.

In addition, the General Partner prepares the books and records and provides the
administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation
from time to time in connection with the operation of the Partnership. These
services include the preparation of required books and records and reports to
limited partners, government agencies and regulators; computation of net asset
value; calculation of fees; assistance in connection with subscriptions,
redemptions and limited partner communications; and preparation of offering
documents and sales literature.

While the Partnership and the Funds have the right to seek lower commission
rates from other commodity brokers at any time, the General Partner believes
that the customer agreements and other arrangements with the commodity broker
are fair, reasonable and competitive.

The programs traded by each Advisor on behalf of the Partnership are: Drury -
Diversified Trend-Following Program, Graham - K4D-15V Program ("K4D"), JWH -
Global Analytics Program, Aspect - Diversified Program, CFM - Discus Program,
Willowbridge - Argo Trading System ("Argo"), Krom River - Commodity Program and
Altis - Global Futures Portfolio Program. Effective January 1, 2013,
Willowbridge trades its w/Praxis Futures Trading Approach on behalf of the
Partnership. CFM ceased trading the Partnership's assets on December 31, 2012.
As of December 31, 2012 and September 30, 2012, the Partnership's assets were
allocated among the Advisors in the following approximate

 29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

percentages:

 Advisor December 31, 2012 September 30, 2012
 Drury Capital, Inc. 16 % 15 %
 Graham Capital Management, L.P. 7 % 9 %
 John W. Henry & Company, Inc. - % 4 %
 Aspect Management (Cayman) Limited 20 % 19 %
 Capital Fund Management S.A. 13 % 14 %
 Willowbridge Associates Inc. 6 % 5 %
 Krom River Trading Program 19 % 17 %
 Altis Partners (Jersey) Limited 19 % 17 %

No assurance is given that an Advisor's trading program will be profitable or
that it will not experience losses.

Drury Capital, Inc.

Drury trades its Diversified Trend-Following Program on behalf of Drury Master.
The Diversified Trend-Following program is systematic and technical. Drury may
exercise judgment regarding liquidity issues. Systematic traders rely primarily
on trading programs or models that generate trading signals. The systems
utilized to generate trading signals are changed from time to time (although
generally infrequently), but the trading instructions generated by the system
being used are followed without significant additional analysis or
interpretation.

The Diversified Trend-Following Program is built on elements of trend-following
and diversification. The program emphasizes diversification by trading metals,
agricultural products, foreign exchange, stock indices, energy products,
financial instruments and tropical products (softs).

The Diversified Trend-Following Program trades 70 portfolio instruments and is
generally positioned in 45 of these instruments on average. Positions can be
short as well as long. The Diversified Trend-Following Program has no market or
sector bias, as Drury believes that each instrument can produce long-term
profits through the application of independent technical analysis and risk
management.

Graham Capital Management, L.P.

Graham trades its K4D program, a systematic, proprietary trading program on
behalf of Graham Master.

Graham trades actively in both U.S. and foreign markets, primarily in futures
contracts, forward contracts, spot contracts and associated derivative
instruments such as options and swaps. Graham engages in exchange for physical
transactions, which involve the exchange of a futures position for the
underlying physical commodity without making an open competitive trade on an
exchange. Instruments and contracts not traded on an organized exchange may be
entered with banks, brokerage firms or other financial counterparties.

The K4D-15V Program utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers
broad diversification in both financial and non-financial markets, trading in
approximately 80-90 global markets. It is intended to generate significant
returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility. The computer
models on a daily basis analyze the recent price action, the relative strength
and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the
quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market.

In addition to the trend system or systems at its base, the K4D-15V quantitative
investment program has added numerous other trading strategies developed by
Graham's research department. Graham believes strongly in the importance of
research and development activity and particularly in the development of new
trading strategies and portfolio management techniques. Trading strategies
developed by Graham research and added to Graham investment programs include not
only trend systems but also other styles of systems, with varying time horizons.
Such systems generally are based on computerized mathematical models and can
rely both on technical and fundamental information as the basis for their
trading decisions. Graham intends to add new trading strategies to its
investment programs as well as to modify the systems currently in place in such
programs in its ongoing efforts to keep pace with changing market conditions,
and it anticipates that the constellation of trading strategies comprising each
investment program will continue to grow and evolve over time. The decision to
add or subtract systems or strategies from any investment program shall be at
the sole discretion of Graham.

John W. Henry & Company, Inc.

 JWH traded its JWH Global Analytics Program on behalf of the Partnership, a
proprietary, systematic trading system. Since the firm's inception, the JWH
investment philosophy had been based on the premise that market prices, rather
than market fundamentals, are the key aggregators of information necessary to
make investment decisions and that market prices, which may at first seem
random, are actually related through time in complex, but discernable ways.

Global Analytics invested in both long- and short-term price movements. The
program invested in a broad spectrum of worldwide financial and non-financial
markets, including interest rate, non-U.S. stock index, currency, metals, energy
and agricultural contracts. GlobalAnalytics used JWH's five phase investment
style (a position is maintained, long or short, in a market at all times) and
JWH's three phase investment style (positions are taken when trends are
identified, but the program may take a neutral stance or liquidate open
positions in non-trending markets).

Willowbridge Associates Inc.

As of December 31, 2012, Willowbridge traded its Select Investment Program using
the Argo Trading System ("Argo") on behalf of Willowbridge Master. Argo was a
proprietary, computerized systematic trading system that relied on technical
information. It was not a trend-following system, but did follow a trend when
the opportunity arises. Argo uses the concepts of pattern recognition,
support/resistance levels and counter trend liquidations in making trading
decisions. Argo determines, on a daily basis, whether to be long, short or flat
the various commodities in its portfolio.

 30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pattern recognition, support/resistance levels and counter-trend liquidations
are defined as follows:

Pattern recognition is the ability to identify patterns that appear to have
acted as precursors of price advances or declines in the past.

A support level is a previous low-a price level under the current market price
at which point buying interest is expected to be sufficiently strong to overcome
selling pressure.

A resistance level is a previous high-a price level over the current market
price at which point selling pressure is expected to overcome buying pressure
and a price advance is expected to be turned back.

A counter-trend liquidation is the closing out of a position after a significant
price move on the assumption that the market is due for a correction.

Effective January 1, 2013, Willowbridge will trade the Partnership's assets
allocated to it in accordance with its wPraxis Futures Trading Approach
("Praxis").

Praxis will utilize a fully discretionary trading strategy to build a portfolio
consisting of futures on currency, fixed income, stock indices and commodities
pursuant to Praxis. The approach may trade commodities, futures, forwards,
options, spot contracts in commodities, currencies and fixed income markets,
and, in the future, it may trade swaps. All positions are closely monitored to
evaluate risk parameter status. As markets move, positions are refined and
expectations updated in response to current market conditions.

Aspect Capital Limited.

Aspect trades its Diversified Program on behalf of Aspect Master. The
Diversified Program is a proprietary, systematic global futures trading program.
Its goal is the generation of significant medium-term capital growth independent
of stock and bond market returns within a rigorous risk management framework.

The Diversified Program applies a systematic and broadly diversified global
investment system, which deploys multiple investment strategies that, primarily
through the use of derivatives, seek to identify and exploit directional moves
in the market behavior of a broad range of financial instruments and other
assets including (but not limited to) currencies, interest rates, indices, debt
securities (including bonds) and commodities (including energy, metal and
agricultural commodities). By maintaining comparatively small exposure to any
individual market and maintaining positions in a variety of contracts, Aspect
aims to achieve long-term diversification. Generally, the Diversified Program
maintains positions in the majority of traded markets. Market concentration
varies according to the strength of signals, volatility and liquidity, amongst
other factors. The emphasis is upon structuring a genuinely diversified set of
market risk allocations that is designed to maximize the probability of returns
wherever profit opportunities appear. Market exposures are monitored daily and
the level of exposure of the Diversified Program in each market is quantifiable
at all times and changes in accordance with market volatility and liquidity.

The Diversified Program employs an automated system to collect, process and
analyze market data (including current and historical price data) and identify
and exploit directional moves in market behavior. The Diversified Program trades
across a variety of frequencies to exploit trends over a range of timescales.
Positions are taken according to the aggregate signal and are adjusted to
attempt to control risk.

Capital Fund Management S.A.

CFM traded its Discus Program on behalf of CFM Master. The Discus Program was a
proprietary, multi-strategy, 100% statistical and systematic program that sought
to identify prevailing market conditions and adopt the most efficient trading
strategy for those conditions. The strategy at times followed medium to long
term trends, and at other times established short term positions in the
direction of or opposite a trend.

CFM designed the Discus Program to trade a diversified portfolio of
approximately 50 futures and forward contracts among the following sectors:
short, medium and long term interest rates, stock indices, currencies and
commodities.

Altis Partners (Jersey) Limited.

 Altis trades its Global Futures Portfolio Program on behalf of Altis Master.
It is a proprietary, systematic, automated trading system. The Altis Global
Futures Portfolio trading system currently trades in over 100 futures markets on
recognized futures exchanges globally. Altis may add or remove markets from the
trading system in response to changes in market liquidity. Under the fully
automated system, changes in market prices are forecast over a number of future
periods and the portfolio is optimized to take best advantage of these
forecasts. Forecasts are derived from a number of quantitative market phenomena;
for instance, directional movement components look for persistent upward or
downward price movements over a number of time-scales, and anti-trending
components are invoked when such movements may have gone too far too fast. Other
inputs are derived from changes in perceived instrument volatility and the
effect of one market against another closely correlated one.

Under the trading system, the relevant return forecasts, together with their
corresponding measures of risk, and market correlation are re-estimated daily.
Portfolio resources are then allocated to where the approach expects significant
changes in prices, bearing in mind the need to diversify exposure to risk. As a
result, portfolio composition is not fixed; there are no pre-assigned weightings
to markets or sectors. Moreover, no one market is treated differently to its
peers in terms of parameter inputs. Due to the number of inputs or indicators
used, and their application across a broad range of markets, portfolio changes
are generally small, except perhaps during periods of extreme volatility.

Krom River Trading Program.

Krom River trades its Commodity Program on behalf of KR Master, a systematic
trading system that relies on fundamental and technical factors. The Commodity
Program trades in at least 20 different markets including base metals, precious
metals, energy, agricultural and softs. The trade types will include long
volatility, directional and relative value. The trading instruments will be
exchange-listed futures and options, which will be traded on both fundamental
and technical basis. Krom River's Commodity Program will not trade
over-the-counter instruments, nor take physical deliveries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Boronia Capital Pty. Ltd.

Boronia trades its Boronia Diversified Program, a systematic trading program, on
behalf of Boronia Trading Company. The trading systems used by Boronia are
proprietary and confidential. The trading systems utilize quantitative
techniques to generate returns in the financial markets. A diversified portfolio
of over 60 liquid markets is traded across 4 asset classes and multiple time
frames using futures on equity, bond, currency and commodity markets plus spot
foreign exchange. Markets may be added or removed from the portfolio over time.

Trades are entered into markets on a fully automated basis directly by computer
to the relevant exchange with no human intervention. The trading decisions are
based on a number of robust and well researched proprietary algorithms developed
by the advisor.

Since the inception of the trading program, Boronia continues to research new
insights and other ways to improve its risk adjusted returns.

Kaiser Trading Group Pty. Ltd.

Kaiser trades its Global Diversified Program, a systematic trading program on
behalf of Kaiser Trading Company. Kaiser takes trading opportunities by using a
systematic, computer based and statistically validated approach built around the
trading psychology of the markets.

The system has four major components: R&D environment, money management, risk
measurement and trading rules. The details of the system in its entirety are
proprietary and confidential. Therefore, the following details are general in
nature.

At present, Kaiser has 22 trading rules in operation. The rules are based on
pattern matching and are short term in nature and include both break and
contrarian models. These rules are traded over 39 different markets including
foreign exchange forward and futures and options on, bonds, global indices,
metals, energy and soft commodities. Each trading rule is the same, using the
same parameters, regardless of the markets traded.

The trading rules are systematically tested over a comprehensive database using
the systems research environment. The criteria that determines whether a trading
rule is to be accepted into the system includes: profitability, robustness,
consistency and diversification. Once a trading rule is accepted into the system
it is integrated using the same money management and risk analytic principles
and software that have been applied to the preceding trading rules.

Risk measurement is accomplished by calculating pertinent risk measures such as
correlation between markets and volatility of markets. These risk measures are
then used to automatically scale trading positions or eliminate other positions.

Money management principles and tools are applied in a similar fashion to each
rule. Entry levels, stop-loss and stop-gain positions are calculated daily.
These are checked and sent to market.

No assurance can be given that the Advisors' strategies will be successful or
that they will generate profits for the Partnership.

Specific Fund level performance information is included in Note 5 to the

For the period January 1, 2012 through October 31, 2012, the average allocation
by commodity market sector for the portion of the Partnership's assets traded
directly by JWH was as follows:

 Currencies 22.7 %
 Energy 12.3 %
 Grains 6.5 %
 Interest Rates Non-U.S. 14.9 %
 Interest Rates U.S. 8.8 %

(a) Liquidity.
The Partnership does not engage in the sales of goods or services. The
Partnership's assets are its (i) investment in Funds, (ii) equity in its trading
account, consisting of cash and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open
futures contracts, and (iii) interest receivable. Because of the low margin
deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price
movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership. While substantial
losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity
occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012.

To minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits, the Partnership/Funds
follow certain trading policies, including:

 (i) The Partnership/Funds invests their assets only in commodity interests
 that the Advisors believes are traded in sufficient volume to permit ease
 of taking and liquidating positions. Sufficient volume, in this context,
 refers to a level of liquidity that the Advisor believes will permit it
 to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market.

 (ii) An Advisor will not initiate additional positions in any commodity if
 these positions would result in aggregate positions requiring a margin
 of more than 66 2/3% of the Partnership's net assets allocated to that
 Advisor.

 (iii) The Partnership/Funds may occasionally accept physical delivery of a
 commodity. Unless such delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering
 the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate
 clearinghouse, the physical commodity position is fully hedged.

 (iv) The Partnership/Funds do not employ the trading technique commonly known
 as "pyramiding," in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on
 existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional
 positions in the same or related commodities.

 (v) The Partnership/Funds do not utilize borrowings other than short-term
 borrowings if the Partnership/Funds take delivery of any cash
 commodities.

 (vi) The Advisors may, from time to time, employ trading strategies such as
 spreads or straddles on behalf of the Partnership/Funds. "Spreads" and
 "Straddles" describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the
 simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same
 commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets.

 34
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (vii) The Partnership/Funds will not permit the churning of its commodity
 trading account. The term "churning" refers to the practice of entering
 and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to
 profit from the trades, indicating the desire to generate commission
 income.

From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the Partnership's average margin
to equity ratio (i.e., the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin)
was approximately 16.3%. The foregoing margin to equity ratio takes into account
cash held in the Partnership's name, as well as the allocable value of the
positions and cash held on behalf of the Partnership in the name of the Funds.

In the normal course of business, the Partnership and the Funds are parties to
financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative
financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial
instruments include forwards, futures, options and swaps, whose values are based
upon an underlying asset, index or reference rate, and generally represent
future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or
sell other financial instruments at specified terms at specified future dates,
or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable
possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another
financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an exchange or
over-the-counter ("OTC"). Exchange-traded instruments are standardized and
include futures and certain forwards and option contracts. OTC contracts are
negotiated between contracting parties and include swaps and certain forwards
and option contracts. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks
similar to those relating to the underlying financial instruments including
market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are
greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the
greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. The General
Partner estimates that at any given time approximately 9.3% to 29.6% of the
Partnership/Funds' contracts are traded OTC.

The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited
to the amount of their share of the Partnership's assets and undistributed
profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the
Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.

Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial
instruments traded by the Partnership/Funds due to market changes, including
interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or
security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and
liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded by
the Partnership/Funds. The Partnership/Funds are exposed to a market risk equal
to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability
on such contracts sold short.

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a
counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The
Partnership's/Funds' risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is
typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial
Condition and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the
instruments. The Partnership's/Funds' risk of loss is reduced through the use of
legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit
the Partnership/Funds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and
liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The
Partnership/Funds have credit risk and concentration risk as CGM/MS & Co. or a
CGM affiliate is the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the
Partnership's/Funds' assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded
instruments is reduced to the extent that through CGM and MS & Co., the
Partnership's/Funds' counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization.

As both a buyer and seller of options, the Funds pay or receive a premium at the
outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the
contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Funds to potentially
unlimited liability; for purchased options the risk of loss is limited to the
premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not
require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Funds do not consider
these contracts to be guarantees.

The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership's/Funds'
risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management
monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures
for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the
Partnership/Funds may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the
General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with
risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition,
on-line monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures, forwards and
options positions by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and
collateral positions. (See also "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" for further information on financial instrument risk included in the notes
to financial statements.)

Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures and other derivatives
trading, the Partnership knows of no trends, demands, commitments, events or
uncertainties which will result in or which are reasonably likely to result in
the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The
Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may, in its
discretion, cause the Partnership to cease trading operations and liquidate all
open positions under certain circumstances including a decrease in net asset
value per Redeemable Unit to less than $400 as of the close of business on any
trading day.

 35

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Capital Resources.

(i) The Partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures.

(ii) The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the
partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by
expenses, interest income, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of
profits, if any. Gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted. Market
movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors
which the Advisors may or may not be able to identify, such as changing supply
and demand relationships, weather, government, agricultural, commercial and
trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic
events and changes in interest rates. Partnership expenses consist of, among
other things, brokerage fees and advisory fees. The level of these expenses is
dependent upon trading performance and the level of Net Assets maintained. In
addition, the amount of interest income payable by CGM is dependent upon
interest rates over which the Partnership/Funds nor CGM/MS&Co have no control.

No forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period. A
limited partner may require the Partnership to redeem their Redeemable Units at
the net asset value per Redeemable Unit as of the last day of any month on three
business days' notice to the General Partner. There is no fee charged to limited
partners in connection with redemptions. Redemptions generally are funded out of
the Partnership's cash holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2012,
125,271.8658 Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $126,039,433 as well as
1,516.5660 General Partner unit equivalents redeemed totaling $1,501,899. For
the year ended December 31, 2011, 98,395.4114 Redeemable Units were redeemed
totaling $111,795,813. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 83,328.4812
Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $96,244,456.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, there were additional subscriptions of
29,524.6495 Redeemable units totaling $30,254,564. For the year ended
December 31, 2011, there were additional subscriptions of 67,129.1576 Redeemable
units totaling $76,224,085. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there were
additional subscriptions of 87,197.4852 Redeemable Units totaling $101,745,934.

(c) Results of Operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net asset value per unit decreased
13.2% from $1,068.80 to $927.41. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the net
asset value per unit decreased 8.3% from $1,165.28 to $1,068.80. For the year
ended December 31, 2010, the net asset value per unit decreased 3.9% from
$1,212.71 to $1,165.28.

The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $34,447,602 before brokerage
fees and expenses in 2012. Losses were primarily attributed to the
Partnership's/Funds' trading in currencies, energy, grains, livestock, metals
and softs and were partially offset by gains in U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates
and indices. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership's
investment in the Funds is disclosed on page 49 under "Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."

 The most significant losses were incurred within the metals sector from long
positions in silver and gold futures as prices declined during February on
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from offering additional
stimulus as the economy recovers, eroding demand for the precious metals. Gold
futures prices continued to decline after India, the world's biggest bullion
buyer, increased the tax on imports of precious metals. Additional losses in
this sector were recorded during November from short positions in copper futures
as prices advanced as the strongest Chinese-manufacturing reading in seven
months signaled an economic recovery in the world's biggest consumer of
industrial metals. Within the energy sector, losses were incurred during June,
October, and November from long positions in natural gas futures as prices
declined after a U.S. government report showed an unexpected gain in U.S.
stockpiles as mild weather reduced demand. Elsewhere, losses were incurred from
short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices advanced amid
speculation the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza may disrupt
crude supply from the Middle East. Within the soft commodities, losses were
incurred primarily during June and July from short positions in sugar futures as
prices rose on continued concern global supplies will remain limited after wet
weather delayed cane crushing in Brazil. Additional losses in this sector were
recorded during January from short positions in cocoa futures as prices advanced
on speculation supplies will ebb in the Ivory Coast, the world's top producer of
cocoa. Prices of cocoa futures continued to rise after a nationwide strike
spurred concern that supplies would be disrupted in Nigeria, the world's
fourth-largest producer of cocoa. Within the currency sector, losses were
incurred primarily during June and August from short positions in the British
pound versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the British pound advanced as
European Union leaders eased terms on loans to Spanish banks, taking a step
towards resolving the region's debt crisis. Additional losses were incurred
during May from long positions in the British pound. Losses were also incurred
in this sector from short positions in the Canadian dollar and Swiss franc as
the value of these currencies also advanced versus the U.S. dollar. Within the
livestock sector, losses were incurred primarily during September from short
positions in cattle futures as prices rose on signs of shrinking U.S. beef
supplies amid rising demand. Within the agricultural sector, losses were
incurred primarily during September from long positions in corn futures as
prices fell on speculation that U.S. Midwest rain during August limited crop
damage caused by the severe drought in June and July. Losses in this sector were
also incurred from trading wheat futures. A portion of the Partnership's losses
during the year was offset by gains achieved within the global interest rate
sector, primarily during April and May, from long positions in European, U.S.,
and Australian fixed-income futures as prices advanced as Greece failed to form
a unified government, increasing concern Europe's debt crisis was worsening and
spurring demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Additional profits
from long positions in this sector were recorded during July. Additional gains
were experienced in the global stock index sector, primarily during February,
from long positions in U.S. and European equity index futures as prices rose
amid positive economic news, including a better-than-expected U.S. employment
report and an expansion in manufacturing in China, Europe, and the U.S.
Additional profits from long positions in this sector were recorded during
December.

The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $2,215,398 before brokerage
fees and expenses in 2011. Losses were primarily attributed to the
Partnership's/Funds' trading in currencies, energy, grains, livestock, metals
and indices and were partially offset by gains in U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates and softs.

Within the global stock index markets, losses were incurred during March, May,
July, and August. During March, long positions in Pacific Rim and European
equity index futures resulted in losses as prices moved sharply lower after the
tsunami and subsequent nuclear plant disaster in Japan spurred concern about
global economic growth. Additional losses were experienced within this sector
during May from long positions in European, U.S., and Pacific Rim equity index
futures as prices declined on worse-than-expected economic reports and mounting
worries over the European debt crisis. During July and August, long positions in
European, U.S., and Pacific Rim equity index futures resulted in losses as
prices dropped amid ongoing concern about the European sovereign debt crisis and
Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States' sovereign credit rating.
Within the agricultural complex, losses were incurred primarily during July and
September from long futures positions in corn and soybeans as prices declined on
speculation that Europe's sovereign debt crisis may hinder the global economy,
reducing demand for the grains. Additional losses were experienced within this
sector during December from short futures positions in soybeans and corn as
prices moved higher on concern adverse weather may reduce output in South
America. Within the currency sector, losses were recorded primarily during May
from long positions in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar as the value of
the British pound moved lower against the U.S. dollar after Standard & Poor's
downgraded Greece's credit rating, prompting concern that the European sovereign
debt crisis may escalate. Additional losses were recorded during August and
September from long positions in the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar
versus the U.S. dollar as the value of these "commodity currencies" moved lower
in tandem with declining commodity prices. Further losses were recorded within
the currency sector during October from long positions in the Japanese yen
versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the Japanese yen fell after the Bank of
Japan intervened to weaken Japan's currency for the third time during 2011.
Losses were also experienced within the metals markets, primarily during May and
June, due to long positions in copper, nickel, and aluminum futures as base
metals prices fell as a slowing global economy and a rising U.S. dollar eroded
the appeal of commodities as an investment and eased the risk of accelerating
inflation. Further losses were recorded during October from short positions in
copper futures as prices rose on speculation of increased demand in China, the
world's biggest purchaser of copper. Within the energy complex, losses were
incurred primarily during May from long futures positions in crude oil and its
related products as prices moved lower after signs the global economic recovery
is slowing spurred concern that energy demand may weaken. A portion of the
Partnership's losses during the year was offset by gains recorded within the
global interest rate sector throughout the third quarter from long positions in
U.S., European, and Australian fixed income futures as prices advanced higher
due to concern about the European sovereign debt crisis and a faltering global
economy. Further gains were achieved within this sector during December from
long positions in European and Australian fixed income futures as prices rose on
increased "safe-haven" demand while European leaders struggled to find funding
for the euro-zone rescue plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest income on 80% of the average daily equity maintained in cash in the
Partnership's (or the Partnership's allocable portion of a Fund's) brokerage
account was earned at the monthly average 30-day U.S. Treasury bill yield.
Interest income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2012
increased by $89,885 and $83,058, respectively, as compared to the corresponding
periods in 2011. The increase is due to an increase in the average Treasury bill
rates as compared to the corresponding periods in 2011. Interest earned by the
Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of
interest income earned by the Partnership depends on the average daily equity in
the Partnership's and the Funds' accounts and upon interest rates over which
neither the Partnership/Funds nor CGM has control.

Brokerage fees are calculated on the Partnership's adjusted net asset value on
the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance,
subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to
the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Brokerage fees for the three
and twelve months ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $2,102,087 and
$7,997,331, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2011. The
decrease in brokerage fees is primarily due to a decrease in average net assets
during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the
corresponding periods in 2011.

Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset
value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance,
subscriptions and redemptions. Management fees for the three and twelve months
ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $746,739 and $2,741,720, respectively, as
compared to the corresponding periods in 2011. The decrease in management fees
is due to a decrease in average net assets during the three and twelve months
ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2011.

Incentive fees are based on the new trading profits generated by each Advisor at
the end of the quarter as defined in the respective management agreements
between the Partnership, the General Partner and each Advisor. There were no
incentive fees earned for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2012.
There were no incentive fees earned for the three months ended December 31,
2011. Trading performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 resulted
in incentive fees of $868,682.

The Partnership pays professional fees, which generally include legal and
accounting expenses. Professional fees for the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2011 were $703,214 and $837,729, respectively.

The Partnership pays other expenses, which generally include filing, reporting
and data processing fees. Other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011 were $263,514 and $610,675, respectively.

The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $29,420,158 before brokerage
fees and expenses in 2010. Gains were primarily attributed to the
Partnership's/Funds' trading in currencies, grains, U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates, metals and softs and were partially offset by losses in energy, indices
and livestock.

Losses were experienced within the energy markets from long futures positions in
crude oil and its related products as prices declined amid speculation that
China's economic activity and energy demand may ease. Throughout May, long
futures positions in crude oil and its related products resulted in additional
losses as prices declined on continued worries that Europe's debt troubles might
slow down the global economic recovery and thereby weaken energy demand. Losses
were also recorded in short positions in natural gas as prices unexpectedly
rallied due to higher demand for electricity in the summer on higher
temperature. Within the global stock index sector, losses were incurred in
January from long positions in European, U.S., and Pacific Rim equity index
futures as prices moved lower amid disappointing U.S. corporate earnings reports
and mounting concerns over sovereign debt defaults from a number of European
countries. During May and June, further losses were incurred from long positions
in European, U.S., and Japanese equity-index futures as prices moved lower on
growing concerns that Greece's sovereign debt crisis might spread throughout
Europe.

A portion of the Partnership's losses for the year was offset by gains recorded
in the fixed-income sector from long positions in European, U.S., and Japanese
fixed-income futures. In this sector, prices increased during the first quarter
on concerns that lending restrictions in China, possible reductions in U.S.
stimulus measures, and Greece's fiscal struggles might stifle the global
economic rebound. Prices were then pressured higher during the second quarter
amid an unexpected drop in U.S. consumer confidence, increased regulatory
scrutiny of the financial industry, and the growing European debt crisis. During
the third quarter, prices continued to climb higher due to concern that European
governments may struggle to repay their debt and Chinese economic growth may be
slowing. In the metals markets, gains were recorded throughout September,
October, November, and December as long futures positions in silver and gold
resulted in additional gains for the metals sector as prices rose amid increased
demand for the precious metals due to a drop in the value of the U.S. dollar,
with silver futures rallying to a 30-year high and gold prices reaching a new
all-time high. Within the currency markets, gains were achieved primarily during
May, September and December. During May, short positions in the euro versus the
U.S. dollar posted gains as the euro weakened amid concerns over the Greek debt
crisis. During September, long positions in the Australian dollar versus the
U.S. dollar resulted in gains as the value of the Australian dollar rose against
the U.S. dollar amid speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia may raise
interest rates in October. During December, gains were achieved due to long
positions in the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, South African rand, and New
Zealand dollar versus the U.S. dollar as the value of these "commodity
currencies" moved higher against the U.S. dollar in tandem with rising commodity
prices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the General Partner's opinion, the Advisors continue to employ trading
methods and produce results consistent with their expected performance given
market conditions and the objectives of the Partnership. The General Partner
continues to monitor the Advisors' performance on a daily, weekly, monthly and
annual basis to assure these objectives are met.

Commodity markets are highly volatile. Broad price fluctuations and rapid
inflation increase the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increase
the possibility of profit. The profitability of the Partnership depends on the
existence of major price trends and the ability of certain of the Advisors to
identify those price trends correctly. Price trends are influenced by, among
other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental,
agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and
international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To
the extent that market trends exist and the Advisors are able to identify them,
the Partnership expects to increase capital through operations.

In allocating the assets of the Partnership among the trading advisors, the
General Partner considers past performance, trading style, volatility of markets
traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the
allocation of assets among the trading advisors and may allocate assets to
additional advisors at any time. Each Advisor's percentage allocation and
trading program is described in the "overview" section of this Item 7.

(d) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. None.

(e) Contractual Obligations. None.

(f) Operational Risk.

The Partnership/Funds are directly exposed to market risk and credit risk, which
arise in the normal course of their business activities. Slightly less direct,
but of critical importance, are risks pertaining to operational and back office
support. This is particularly the case in a rapidly changing and increasingly
global environment with increasing transaction volumes and an expansion in the
number and complexity of products in the marketplace.

Such risks include:

Operational/Settlement Risk - the risk of financial and opportunity loss and
legal liability attributable to operational problems, such as inaccurate pricing
of transactions, untimely trade execution, clearance and/or settlement, or the
inability to process large volumes of transactions. The Partnership/Funds are
subject to increased risks with respect to their trading activities in emerging
markets, where clearance, settlement, and custodial risks are often greater than
in more established markets.

Technological Risk - the risk of loss attributable to technological limitations
or hardware failure that constrain the Partnership's/Funds' ability to gather,
process, and communicate information efficiently and securely, without
interruption, to customers and in the markets where the Partnership/Funds
participate. Additionally, the General Partner's computer systems may be
vulnerable to unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or
malware, cyber attacks and other events that could have a security impact on
such systems. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could
jeopardize a limited partner's personal, confidential, proprietary or other
information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the General
Partner's computer systems, and adversely affect the Partnership's business,
financial condition or results of operations.

Legal/Documentation Risk - the risk of loss attributable to deficiencies in the
documentation of transactions (such as trade confirmations) and customer
relationships (such as master netting agreements) or errors that result in
non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Financial Control Risk - the risk of loss attributable to limitations in
financial systems and controls. Strong financial systems and controls ensure
that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with
management's authorization, and that financial information utilized by
management and communicated to external parties, including the Partnership's
unit holders, creditors, and regulators, is free of material errors.

(g) Critical Accounting Policies.

Partnership's and the Funds' Investments. All commodity interests, including
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, are held
for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on trade date and
open contracts are

 38

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

recorded at fair value (as described below) at the measurement date. Investments
in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains or
losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains or losses on
open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account on the
Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains or losses and any change
in net unrealized gains or losses from the preceding period are reported in the
Statements of Income and Expenses.

Partnership's and the Funds' Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived
from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair value hierarchy within
which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety shall be determined based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in
its entirety. Management has concluded that based on available information in
the marketplace, the Funds' Level 1 assets and liabilities are actively traded.

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") also requires the need to use judgment in determining if a formerly
active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market
has become inactive. Management has concluded that based on available
information in the marketplace, there has not been a significant decrease in the
volume and level of activity in the Partnership's and the Funds' Level 2 assets
and liabilities.

The Partnership and the Funds will separately present purchases, sales,
issuances, and settlements in their reconciliation of Level 3 fair value
measurements (i.e., to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net
basis), and make disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and the
inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that
fall within either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as required
under GAAP.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Partnership adopted Accounting Standards Update
("ASU") 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
Disclosure Requirements in GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards"
("IFRS"). The amendments within this ASU changed the wording used to describe
many of the GAAP requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing
information about fair value measurements to eliminate unnecessary wording
differences between GAAP and IFRS. However, some of the amendments clarified the
Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the "FASB") intent about the application
of existing fair value measurement requirements and other amendments changed a
particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing
information about fair value measurements. This new guidance did not have a
significant impact on the Partnership's financial statements.

The Partnership and the Funds consider prices for exchange-traded commodity
futures, forwards and options contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). The values of
non-exchange-traded forwards, swaps and certain options contracts for which
market quotations are not readily available are priced by broker-dealers who
derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs
(Level 2). Investments in funds (other commodity pools) where there are no other
rights or obligations inherent within the ownership interest held by the
Partnership are priced based on the end of the day net asset value (Level 2).
The value of the Partnership's investment in the Funds reflects its proportional
interest in the Funds. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,
the Partnership and the Funds did not hold any derivative instruments that were
priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of
management's assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3). During
the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no transfers of assets
and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2.

Futures Contracts. The Partnership and the Funds trade futures contracts. A
futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of
investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity,
at a specified price on a specified future date, unless the contract is closed
before the delivery date or if the delivery quantity is something where physical
delivery cannot occur (such as the S&P 500 Index), whereby such contract is
settled in cash. Payments ("variation margin") may be made or received by the
Partnership and the Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations
in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains
or losses by the Partnership and the Funds. When the contract is closed, the
Partnership and the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to
make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin
deposits, through the futures broker, directly with the exchange on which the
contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized
gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the Statements of Income and
Expenses.

Forward Foreign Currency Contracts. Forward foreign currency contracts are those
contracts where the Funds agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of
foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed future date. Forward
foreign currency contracts are valued daily, and the Funds' net equity therein,
representing unrealized gain or loss on the contracts as measured by the
difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into
the contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date, is included in the
Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in
net unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency contracts are recognized in
the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively
and are included in the Statements of Income and Expenses.

The Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations
from changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are
included in net gain (loss) on investments in the Statements of Income and
Expenses.

London Metals Exchange Forward Contracts. Metal contracts traded on the London
Metals Exchange ("LME") represent a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified
quantity of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin or zinc. LME contracts traded by
the Funds are

 39

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cash settled based on prompt dates published by the LME. Payments ("variation
margin") may be made or received by the Funds each business day, depending on
the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are
recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Funds. A contract is considered
offset when all long positions have been matched with a like number of short
positions settling on the same prompt date. When the contract is closed at the
prompt date, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
time it was closed. Transactions in LME contracts require participants to make
both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin
deposits, through the broker, directly with the LME. Net realized gains
(losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on metal contracts are
included in the Statements of Income and Expenses.

Options. The Funds may purchase and write (sell) both exchange-listed and OTC
options on commodities or financial instruments. An option is a contract
allowing, but not requiring, its holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific
or standard commodity or financial instrument at a specified price during a
specified time period. The option premium is the total price paid or received
for the option contract. When the Funds write an option, the premium received is
recorded as a liability in the Statements of Financial Condition and
marked-to-market daily. When the Funds purchase an option, the premium paid is
recorded as an asset in the Statements of Financial Condition and
marked-to-market daily. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net
unrealized gains (losses) on options contracts are included in the Statements of
Income and Expenses.
