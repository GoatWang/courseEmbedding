Market Insights Q3 2017 Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.

Active skill guided by investment leadership delivers client-focused outcomes. Active debate and the conviction to invest long term turns our insights into thoughtfully made investments.




            GET ACTIVE(R)















Our Investment Beliefs Drive Everything We Do.



Client Alignment: Focused on Outcomes
We stay true to our investment beliefs and a process that is sustainable, repeatable and aligned with the needs of our clients.
 
We can best serve client interests through skilled active management — knowing what we own through robust research, owning companies responsibly by engaging with their management teams and holding positions long enough to let our investment thesis play out.
We believe markets are inefficient and can be exploited to create long-term value through rigorous research, conviction and discipline.
Being investor-led means we make decisions based on how well investments support client outcomes rather than on asset gathering. We invest and run our business the same way — with a long-term view and single-minded focus on doing what is right for clients.
It's not about being the biggest manager. It's about acting in the best interest of clients. We close strategies before they get too large in order to help protect long-term performance for our client assets.


Expand







Continuity: Time Is an Asset
We think, act and invest with a long-term perspective because that is the best way to create value for clients over time.
 
Lengthening the time horizon allows us to tap the more dispersed returns available over longer horizons, while developing conviction and staying disciplined over full market cycles allows our good ideas to potentially become sustainable investments.
Linking investment-team incentives with long-term performance helps create long-term value and aligns with client objectives.
Integrating environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) into our research helps us make long-term investments in companies with potentially lasting competitive advantages.
Strategically planning for the development and succession of key investment professionals preserves the integrity of our investment process and the potential to sustain our active skill over time. 


Expand







Collective Intelligence: Insight to Advantage
By building our organization and culture around collaboration and teamwork, we make the best decisions for clients.
 
There is a big difference between information and insight. We turn insight into an analysis advantage through our global research platform, with analysts able to uncover opportunities worldwide
We create an analysis advantage through collaborative thinking and uncompromised information sharing across geographies, asset classes, sectors and industries.
Favoring the strongest idea over the strongest individual, we use active debate to bring the most thoroughly vetted opportunities to clients. 
Collaboration drives more effective decision making, so we link it directly to investment team compensation by conducting 360-degree peer reviews and rewarding team members for working well together. 


Expand







Risk Management: Seeing All Angles
Risk factors into every investment decision we make, because limiting losses in volatile markets is just as critical as maximizing returns on the upside.
 
We have a risk-aware culture in which every member of our investment team is responsible for assessing risk. Embedded in our investment process, risk management is always on, and we conduct rigorous reviews regularly at the portfolio, security and firm levels.
In market downturns and during periods of market volatility, our active skill helps us take on intentional, rather than unintentional risk — and it helps us find good entry points to invest for long-term value.
With a goal to deliver the greatest return within the risk guidelines of each client portfolio, we focus on solid fundamentals and select investments that can potentially hold their value through changing markets.

Markets Group Institutional Investor Forums

The global investment landscape has been altered almost beyond recognition by the long-term decline in interest rates in most of the developed world, punctuated more recently by negative rates in many countries. While economic activity has rebounded, we have yet to escape the modest global growth envelope we have been operating in since the end of the global financial crisis. In this uncertain environment, what are the key risks and opportunities for institutional asset owners within global fixed income markets? MFS shared insights at two of the upcoming Forums.

Risk Management Conference

The investment landscape has been altered in Canada and globally by the long-term decline in interest rates, punctuated more recently by negative rates in Japan, most of the Eurozone, Switzerland, Demark, and Sweden. Yet, investors still look to fixed income markets as a source of diversification, risk mitigation and return within their overall asset allocation.  MFS’ Chief investment officer of global fixed income, William Adams, will explore the key risks and opportunities for institutional asset owners within Canadian and global fixed income markets in this uncertain environment.
