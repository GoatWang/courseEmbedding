      than anticipated benefit from launches of the generic versions of
      previously patented pharmaceutical products; significant breakdown or
      interruption of our information technology systems; our inability to

      provincial authorities in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing
      and service fees; the impact of divestitures or the acquisition of
      businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us
      to integrate or control; our inability to successfully complete any
      other transaction that we may wish to pursue from time to time; changes

      to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements
      are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Company's Annual
      Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and

AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced that Tim G.

AmerisourceBergen in 2002.
 
“I am very pleased to appoint Tim to his new role,” said Collis. “Since 
he joined the Company 10 years ago, he has demonstrated his ability to 
drive financial discipline throughout the organization, and he has been 
an important partner in driving our operating performance. He brings a 
thorough knowledge of our business as well as unique perspectives from 
other industries to our leadership team, and I am confident that he will 
continue to play a key role in our future success.”
 
“I am excited to be taking this new role and to continue to help drive 
strong financial performance and deliver value to our shareholders,” 
said Guttman. “We have tremendous opportunities ahead, driven by the 
growth areas of the markets we serve, and the unique services we provide 
to manufacturers and healthcare providers. In addition, our demonstrated 
expense and working capital discipline, as well as our strong balance 
sheet give us excellent financial flexibility.”
 
Prior to joining AmerisourceBergen, Guttman was Vice President of 
Finance at Syncor International Corporation, and also previously held

functional problems, unanticipated delays and/or cost overruns; success 
of integration, restructuring or systems initiatives; interest rate and 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic, business, 
competitive and/or regulatory developments in Canada, the United Kingdom 
and elsewhere outside of the United States, including changes and/or 
potential changes in Canadian provincial legislation affecting 
pharmaceutical product pricing or service fees or regulatory action by 
provincial authorities in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing 
and service fees; the impact of divestitures or the acquisition of 
businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us 
to integrate or control; our inability to successfully complete any 
other transaction that we may wish to pursue from time to time; changes 
in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect our 
tax positions and/or our tax liabilities or adverse resolution of 
challenges to our tax positions; increased costs of maintaining, or 
reductions in our ability to maintain, adequate liquidity and financing 
sources; volatility and deterioration of the capital and credit markets; 
and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or 
operational factors affecting our business generally. Certain additional 
factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results 
to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements 
are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Company's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and 
elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company 
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
