Here To Help You With Your Financial Needs








Why Peoples?Since 1926, PEOPLES has provided loans to generations of Georgians. 
We specialize in consumer loans which help our long time and new customers get through difficult times. Our 11 branch locations are owned, not leased, and our average manager has over 15 years experience with our company. If you are looking to buy a car, we can work with you and an auto dealer of your choice to find the best financing option that fits your current and long term needs.
If you are trapped in a title pawn, or considering one, please check with us.  Our loans are designed to pay off so you can move on with your life.  If you are trying to rebuild your credit, we report to the credit bureau unlike many of our peers.
PEOPLES brings Integrity, Responsibility, Reputation, and Stability to your life.




Personal Loans


Our loans can be used for Christmas loans, vacation loans, back to schools loans, consolidation loans, or any of your other cash needs.  Most of these loans are secured with car titles.  Feel free to shop the other small loan companies and title pawns and compare their payments and fees with ours.
Our loans over $3000 have rates determined by the condition of the collateral and your credit.





Used Car Purchase Loans (Retail Sales Finance)


Our rates and terms on used car financing are determined by your credit, down payment, and the collateral.  We will work with you on getting the right car, payment and term to fit your needs.  Many other lenders will want to trap you into a long term loan that will last longer than your car.  Please do not be fooled by their lower payment as you will be trapped into a car you cannot trade out of.




Real Estate Equity Loans


We do a limited number of real estate first mortgages up to $50,000 for those customers with equity in their house but loan needs too small for a broker or bank.  Please contact your nearest branch and ask to talk to one of our real estate loan officers.

 Proud members of…

PEOPLES
FINANCIAL CORPORATION EARNINGS JUMP 66%
OVER PREVIOUS QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO SECURITIES
SALES

BILOXI, MS
(July 28, 2010) —Second
quarter earnings of Peoples Financial Corporation (NASDAQ
Capital Market: PFBX) , parent of The Peoples Bank, increased
66% over the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to sales of
securities, announced Chevis C. Swetman, chairman and chief
executive officer of the holding company and the bank.

Net income
for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, totaled $1,446,000,
compared to $872,000 for the first quarter of the year. Securities
sales of $34 million during the second quarter resulted in
$1,035,000 of net income.

Earnings
for the first half of 2010 totaled $2,318,000, an increase of 22%

June 30, 2009.

For the
first half of 2010, earnings per share totaled $.45 per average
weighted share, compared to $.37 per share in the same period last
year. Earnings per share figures are based on weighted average
shares outstanding of 5,151,697 for the six months ended
June 30, 2010 and 5,189,474 for the six months ended
June 30, 2009.

“We
were able to deliver solid earnings in the last quarter, due to an
increase in non-interest income, predominantly securities sales;

	PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS




	I. General



	This Proxy Statement is
	furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Peoples Financial Corporation (the Company) of Proxies for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the Annual Meeting) to be held in The Swetman Building
	at The Peoples Bank, Suite 204, 727 Howard Avenue, Biloxi, Mississippi, 39530, on April 26, 2017, at 6:30 P.M., local time, and any adjournment thereof, for the purposes stated

	in the foregoing Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

	The
	mailing address of the principal executive offices of the Company is P.O. Box 529, Biloxi, Mississippi 39533-0529. The notice of annual meeting, Proxy Statement, form of Proxy and 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders will be mailed to shareholders of
	record on or about March 21, 2017.


	Shareholders of record of the Companys Common Stock (the Common Stock), at the close of business on
	February 17, 2017 (the Record Date), are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof. On the Record Date, the Company had outstanding 5,123,186 shares entitled to vote at the Annual
	Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares constitutes a quorum. Except in the election of directors, each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting for shareholder approval.

	Action on a matter is approved if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. Abstentions, which include broker

	non-votes,

	are counted for purposes of determining a
	quorum, but are otherwise not counted.



	Any person giving a Proxy has the right to revoke it at any time before it is exercised. A shareholder may
	revoke his or her Proxy (l)

	 by revoking it in person

	at the Annual Meeting, (2) by written notification to the Secretary of the Company which is received prior to the exercise of the Proxy, or (3) by a subsequent Proxy
	presented to the Company prior to the exercise of the Proxy. All properly executed Proxies, if not revoked, will be voted as directed. If the shareholder does not direct to the contrary, the shares will be voted FOR

	the nominees
	listed in Item 1

	and FOR Item 2 described in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Solicitation of Proxies will be primarily by mail. Officers, directors, and employees of The Peoples Bank (hereinafter referred to as the
	Bank) also may solicit Proxies personally. The Company will reimburse brokers and other persons holding shares in their names, or in the names of nominees, for the expense of transmitting Proxy materials. The cost of soliciting Proxies
	will be borne by the Company.


	The Board of Directors is not aware of any matters other than as set forth herein which are likely to be brought before the
	meeting. If other matters do come before the meeting, the person named in the accompanying Proxy or his substitute will vote the shares represented by such Proxies in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors.



	II. Management Proposals







	Item 1:
	Election of Directors



	The following nominees have been designated by the Nominating Committee and are proposed by the Board of Directors for election
	at the Annual Meeting. The shares represented by

	properly executed

	Proxies will, unless authority to vote is withheld, be voted in favor of these persons.

	In the election of directors, each shareholder may vote his shares cumulatively by
	multiplying the number of shares he is entitled to vote by the number of directors to be elected. This product shall be the number of votes the shareholder may cast for one nominee or by distributing this number of votes among any number of
	nominees. If a shareholder withholds authority for



	 


	2







	one or more nominees and does not direct otherwise, the total number of votes that the shareholder is entitled to cast will be distributed equally among the remaining nominees. Should any of
	these nominees be unable to accept the nomination, the shares voted in favor of the nominee will be voted for such other persons as the Board of Directors shall nominate.

	Each director is elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of
	Shareholders and until his successor is elected and qualified.



	The persons who will be elected to the Board of Directors will be the five nominees
	receiving the largest number of votes.



	A majority of the persons nominated are independent as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards. No family
	relationship exists between any director, executive officer or person nominated to become a director of the Company.


	None of the persons nominated held
	directorship at any time during the past five years at any public company, with the exception of the Company, or registered investment company.

	does not pass, the Board of Directors will reconsider the matter.


	The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR
	this appointment of Porter Keadle Moore, LLC.



	III. Corporate Governance




	General



	The Company has a long-standing commitment to
	strong corporate governance practices. The practices provide an important framework within which our Board of Directors and Management can pursue the strategic objectives of the Company and ensure long-term vitality for the benefit of our
	shareholders. The cornerstone of our practices is an independent and qualified board of directors. All directors are elected annually by the shareholders, and the membership of all board committees are composed entirely of independent directors. The
	Companys Code of Conduct, which is posted on its website,

	www.thepeoples.com

	, applies to all directors, officers and employees.


	 


	4







	Board Independence



	Messrs. Allen, Kelly, Magruder and OKeefe are independent as defined by NASDAQ listing standards.



	Board Composition



	The Companys Nominating
	Committee Charter defines the process and criteria for selecting individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors. It is the Companys intention that all nominees, including those recommended by shareholders, be considered
	using this same process and criteria.


	In accordance with the

	by-laws

	of the Company, the Nominating Committee
	determines, subject to the Companys

	by-laws,

	the size of the Board and develops a slate of nominees to stand for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. In developing the slate, the Nominating
	Committee considers the qualifications set forth in its Charter. Minutes of all Nominating Committee meetings are maintained. The Nominating Committee reports its recommendations regarding the slate of nominees to the Board of Directors for this
	ratification. Once the slate is ratified, the Board of Directors instructs the President of the Company to take such actions as are required to distribute proxy materials to the shareholders in accordance with the Companys

	by-laws

	and applicable regulatory requirements.


	Further, it is the Companys intention that the minimum
	qualifications for nominees be those individuals who have an understanding of the Companys role in the local economy and who have demonstrated integrity and good business judgment. The Committee is encouraged to consider geographic and
	demographic diversity among candidates with financial, regulatory and/or business experience, but not so as to compromise the goal of attracting the most qualified individual candidates.



	Director Nomination



	Since the Company was founded in
	1984, there has never been a conflict or dispute regarding director nominations. Accordingly, the Company does not feel that it is necessary at this time to provide a process whereby nominations may be made directly to the Nominating Committee, and
	this committee does not have a policy for considering candidates recommended by shareholders. However, in accordance with the Companys

	by-laws,

	shareholders may make nominations for election to the Board
	by delivering written nominations to the Companys President not less than 14 days or not more than 50 days prior to the meeting when the election is to be held. If the Company does not give at least 21 days notice of the meeting,
	shareholders are allowed to make nominations by mailing or delivering same to the President not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the notice of meeting is mailed. The Company welcomes nominations from its
	shareholders; however, nominations not made in accordance with the

	by-laws

	Board Attendance



	There were five meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company held during 2016. All directors attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the
	Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by the committees on which they served. The Board of Directors, at its discretion, meets on a periodic basis in executive session with only

	non-employee

	directors in attendance.


	The Company does not have a written policy that members of the Board of Directors attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, but
	they are encouraged to do so. All of the directors of the Company were in attendance at the 2016 Annual Meeting.



	Board Leadership



	The Chairman leads the Board of Directors and oversees board meetings and the delivery of information necessary for the Board of Directors informed
	decision-making. The Chairman also serves as the principal liaison between the Board of Directors and our Management. The Board of Directors determines whether the role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer should be separated or combined
	based on its judgment as to the structure that best serves the interests of the Company. Currently, the Board of Directors believes that the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be held by the same person as this combination has
	served and is serving the Company well by providing unified leadership and direction. The Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors is designated as the lead independent director and calls and presides over executive sessions of the Board of
	Directors.



	Board Committees



	The Company has the
	following standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee.


	The Companys Audit Committee is currently
	composed of independent directors Drew Allen, Rex E. Kelly, Dan Magruder and Jeffrey H. OKeefe. The Companys Board of Directors has determined that Drew Allen is an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined in pertinent
	SEC regulations. The Board based its determination on the experience of Mr. Allen as the chief executive officer of his company in analyzing and evaluating financial statements and consulting with his companys auditors as well as his long
	tenure on the Companys Audit Committee. Mr. Magruder serves as chairman of the Audit Committee, which met eight times during 2016. The Audit Committee may, from time to time, call upon certain advisors or consultants as it deems
	necessary. The Audit Committee acts pursuant to its Audit Committee Charter. The Audit Committee submits its report to the shareholders in Section X below. The Audit Committees Charter is available for review on the Companys website at

	www.thepeoples.com

	.


	The Compensation Committees primary responsibility is to aid the Board of Directors in discharging its duties by
	recommending to the full Board the compensation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings of the Compensation Committee to discuss executive
	performance and compensation. The Executive Vice-President attends each meeting of the Compensation Committee and presents his insights and suggestions. The Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer each provide information and analysis
	to the Compensation Committee that is used in determining the named executive officers compensation. The Compensation Committee has been authorized by the Board of Directors to engage consultants, experts, and/or other advisors that are
	knowledgeable regarding compensation practices within the financial services industry.

	The hiring of such consultants is at the discretion of the Committee. The Compensation Committee did not engage
	any consultants during 2016. The Committee, composed of independent directors Drew Allen, Rex E. Kelly, Dan Magruder and Jeffrey H. OKeefe, met one time during 2016 to review the executive officers performance and consider bonuses for
	the preceding year and salaries for the upcoming year. Mr. Allen serves as chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committees Charter is available for review on the Companys website at

	www.thepeoples.com.



	The Companys Nominating Committee is composed of independent directors Drew Allen, Rex E. Kelly, Dan Magruder and Jeffrey H. OKeefe.
	Mr. Kelly serves as chairman of the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee acts pursuant to a charter which is available on the Companys website at

	www.thepeoples.com

	. The Nominating Committee met two times during 2016 and
	2017 to nominate individuals to stand for election as directors of the Company.



	Boards Role in Risk Management



	Risk is an integral part of the deliberations of the Board of Directors and its committees throughout the year. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors
	annually review the Companys risk assessments, considering managements plan for mitigating these risks. The Board receives monthly written reports relating to the Companys risk management and meets frequently with the Chief Risk
	Officer and other members of Management. The Audit Committee at its discretion meets on a periodic basis with managers from the Audit, Compliance, Security, I/T Security and Loan Review Departments.



	Shareholder Communication



	The Company has implemented a
	shareholder communication process to facilitate communications between shareholders and the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of the Company who wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors, a committee of the Board, the independent directors
	as a group, or any individual member of the Board, may contact Greg M. Batia, Vice President and Auditor, P. O. Box 1172, Biloxi, MS 39533-1172, or at his

	e-mail

	address:

	gbatia@thepeoples.com

	.
	Mr. Batia will compile and submit on a periodic basis all shareholder correspondence to the entire Board of Directors, or, if and as designated in the communication, to a committee of the Board, the independent directors as a group or an
	individual Board member.

	VI. Compensation of
	Executive Officers and Directors




	Compensation Discussion and Analysis



	The Compensation Committee determines the salaries, bonuses and all other compensation of the named executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation
	Table on page 15 of this Proxy Statement, including the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee is also charged with ensuring that policies and practices are in place to facilitate the development of the Companys management talent, ensure
	management succession and enhance the Companys corporate governance and social responsibility.


	A. Guiding Philosophy and Objectives:


	The Compensation Committees guiding philosophy is to attract and retain highly qualified executives, to motivate them to maximize long-term shareholder
	value while balancing both short-term and long-term objectives, and to pay for performance. The following objectives serve as guiding principles for all compensation decisions:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Provide reasonable levels of total compensation that will enable the Company to attract, retain, and motivate high caliber executives who are capable of optimizing and maintaining the Companys performance for the
	benefit of its shareholders.




	 


	9








	 


	


	 


	Maintain executive compensation that is fair and consistent with the Companys size and the compensation practices of the financial services industry.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Provide compensation plans that align with the objective of achieving the mission of being a community bank offering the highest quality products and services.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Align performance bonus opportunities with long-term shareholder interests by making the payment of performance bonuses dependent on the Companys performance with respect to Return on Assets (ROA).




	 




	 


	


	 


	Provide an incentive for personal performance by allocation of discretionary additional bonus opportunities dependent on the executives individual performance.




	B. Responsibility of the Compensation Committee:


	The primary
	responsibility of the Compensation Committee is to aid the Board in discharging its duties by recommending to the full Board the compensation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers of the Company.


	C. Role of Executive Officers:


	The Chief Executive Officer may
	attend the meetings of the Compensation Committee to discuss executive performance and compensation. The Executive Vice-President attends each meeting of the Compensation Committee and presents his insights and suggestions. The Executive
	Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer each provide information and analysis to the Compensation Committee that is used in determining the named executive officers compensation.


	D. Consultants, Experts and/or Other Advisors:


	The Compensation
	Committee has been authorized by the Board of Directors to engage consultants, experts, and/or other advisors that are knowledgeable regarding compensation practices within the financial services industry. The hiring of such consultants is at the
	discretion of the Committee. The Committee did not engage any consultants in 2016.


	E. Factors used to Determine Compensation:


	The Compensation Committees considerations consist of, but are not limited to, analysis of the following factors: financial performance of the Company,
	including ROA, return on equity, and management of assets, liabilities, capital and risk. Additionally, the Compensation Committee uses annual compensation surveys to compare the compensation of positions in similar financial institutions of
	comparable asset size. Specifically, the Bank Administration Institute (BAI) Bank Cash Compensation Survey, which includes compensation data obtained from banks with assets between $500 million and $1 billion in a region that
	includes Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee and the Mississippi Bankers Association (MBA) Salary Survey, which
	includes compensation data obtained from banks in Mississippi with assets between $500 million and $1 billion, are used as reference material in evaluating the compensation of the named executive officers; however, the Company does not
	benchmark compensation to any specific company or companies. The Company does not have access to the identity of the specific companies included in these surveys.


	In determining total compensation, the Committee also considers the performance of the individual named executive officers in areas such as: the scope of
	responsibility of the executive; leadership within the Company, the community and the financial services industry; achievement of work goals; and whether the Company, under the executives leadership, has been a good corporate citizen while
	enhancing shareholder value.


	 


	10






	All of these factors are considered in the context of the complexity and the difficulty of managing business
	risks in the prevailing economic conditions and regulatory environment. The analysis is conducted with respect to each of the executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer.


	F. Compensation Components:


	The named executive officers
	total compensation package includes several components.    The Company rewards current performance and achievement of short-term goals primarily through salaries and bonuses. Other deferred compensation elements, including the
	Executive Supplemental Income Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan, are designed to meet long-term objectives including retaining high-performing executives and to plan for management succession as well as to reward loyalty.



	Salaries



	Salaries are the foundation of each named
	executive officers total compensation package and are normally the largest single component. Salary is the only guaranteed cash payment a named executive officer receives. The Companys goal is to provide an assured level of cash
	compensation in the form of salary to attract and retain high caliber executives. Job specific knowledge and experience as well as leadership ability are recognized with salary.


	In establishing the salary of the Chief Executive Officer for 2016, the Committee primarily considered Mr. Swetmans performance and the performance
	of the Company during 2015 and the compensation levels of chief executive officers of comparable financial institutions. In considering the performance of the Company, the Committee considered the Companys ROA, the change in problem assets and
	asset growth, but utilized no objective criteria. The Committee utilized asset size peer group compensation data as provided by the MBA and the BAI.


	For
	other named executive officers, the Committees recommendation concerning salaries was based upon the compensation levels of executive officers of comparable financial institutions, the performance of the Company during 2015 and the individual
	performance of these named executive officers. The performance of the Company for purposes of establishing salaries was evaluated based on ROA. Individual performance was measured using criteria such as level of job responsibility, achievement of
	work goals and management skills. Among the goals considered was the reduction of problem assets. The Committee also considered asset size peer group compensation data as provided by the MBA and BAI for executive officers with similar duties and
	responsibilities.



	Bonuses



	The Compensation
	Committee awards performance bonuses based upon

	pre-determined

	performance objectives in accordance with The Peoples Bank Bonus Plan (The Bonus Plan). Performance bonuses are generally the other
	cash component paid to named executive officers on an annual basis and may be determined by The Bonus Plan. The Chief Executive Officer and all other named executive officers are eligible to receive a bonus which is based on the financial
	performance of the Company. The specific formula and

	pre-determined

	goals under The Bonus Plan were established by the Compensation Committee using the Companys ROA. The


	 


	11






	performance bonus calculation, which is approved by the Compensation Committee, allows the executive officer to earn up to a maximum percentage of their salary on established ROA targets. The
	targets and bonus calculations as a percentage of salary and targets are:

	The Compensation Committee may, at its discretion, also recommend to the Board that the named executive officers receive an
	additional bonus which is determined on a subjective basis. If this additional discretionary bonus is recommended, the Committee documents its actions in the minutes of their committee meetings. No performance based or discretionary bonuses were
	awarded to named executive officers for 2016 due to the performance of the Company.



	Executive Supplemental Income Plan



	The Company maintains an Executive Supplemental Income Plan (ESI) which provides executives with salary continuation benefits upon their
	retirement, or death benefits to their named beneficiary in the event of their death. Executives of the Company and the Bank are selected to participate in the plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors. All named executive officers of the
	Company have been selected to participate in the plan. ESI benefits are based upon position and salary of the named executive officer at retirement, disability or death. Normal retirement benefits under the plan are equal to 67% of salary for the
	Chief Executive Officer, 58% of salary for the Executive Vice-President and 50% of salary for the other named executive officer at the time of normal retirement, and are payable monthly over a period of 15 years.    The ESI is
	administered by Banc Consulting Partners, who also provide guidance to the Company relating to the valuation method and assumptions.


	The ESI was
	established in 1988, at which time Mr. Swetman became a participant. Miss Wood and Mr. Fulmer became participants after their date of hire at the discretion of the Board.


	Benefits are also available in the event of death, disability or early retirement. Under early retirement provisions, if separation from service occurs on or
	after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date, the Company will pay the named executive officer a reduced benefit. The annual benefit set forth for normal retirement will be reduced by

	one-half

	percent (0.5%) for each month or partial month between separation from service and the normal retirement date. The benefit will be paid monthly over a period of 15 years. Benefits will commence on the
	last day of the month following the named executive officers separation from service. The early retirement date means the date the named executive officer attains at least age 55, has at least 15 years of employment at the Company, and has
	participated in this plan for a minimum of five years. As of December 31, 2016, Mr. Fulmer is the only named executive officer eligible to receive this benefit. The normal retirement date means the date the named executive officer attains
	age 65.


	If separation from service occurs prior to the early retirement date or prior to the normal retirement date, the Company will pay the named
	executive officer his or her executive benefit accrual balance as of his or her separation from service. The benefit will be paid in a single

	lump-sum

	within 60 days of separation from service. As of
	December 31, 2016, Miss Wood is the only named executive officer eligible to receive this benefit.

	If a named executive officer becomes disabled prior to the normal retirement date, the Company will pay the named
	executive officer his or her annual benefit as defined under normal retirement. The benefit will begin the last day of the month commencing with the month following the named executive officers normal retirement date and the benefits will be
	paid monthly over a period of 15 years.


	If the named executive officer dies prior to early retirement, normal retirement or disability, the named
	executive officers named beneficiary is entitled to full benefits under the ESI. If the named executive officer dies while receiving benefits, the named beneficiary is entitled to the remainder of any unpaid benefits.


	Upon a change of control prior to separation from service, the Company will pay the named executive officer his or her annual benefit as defined under normal
	retirement. The benefit will begin the last day of the month commencing with the month following the named executive officers normal retirement date, or, for named executive officers who have already attained their normal retirement date,
	their separation from service, and the benefits will be paid monthly over a period of 15 years.


	Each named executive officers agreement under the
	ESI may be terminated by the Company. In the event the named executive officers agreement under the ESI is terminated, the Company will pay the named executive officer his or her executive accrual balance as of the termination of the
	agreement, or, if a change of control has occurred, the normal retirement benefit. The benefit will begin on the first date allowable under the ESI and the benefit will be paid over a period of 15 years, or, in some special circumstances, paid in
	one lump sum.


	If any amount is required to be included in the income of a named executive officer due to a failure of his or her ESI agreement to meet
	the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the named executive officer may petition the plan administrator for a distribution of that portion of his or her executive benefit accrual that is required to be included in the named
	executive officers income. Upon the grant of such a petition, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the Company will distribute to the named executive officer an amount equal to the portion of the executive benefit accrual required to be
	included in his or her income, which amount cannot exceed the named executive officers unpaid executive benefit accrual. Any distribution will affect and reduce the named executive officers benefits to be paid under his or her ESI
	agreement.


	The benefits will be paid out of the general assets of the Company. The Company has elected to purchase life insurance contracts, more
	specifically Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI), each of which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which are a general asset of the Company.



	Deferred Compensation Plan



	The Company maintains a
	Deferred Compensation Plan for those executives of the Bank holding the title of vice-president, senior vice-president or executive vice-president and approved for participation in the plan by the Board of Directors.    Except
	for the Chief Executive Officer, all named executive officers participated in the plan in 2016. The plan provides each named executive officer a fixed benefit upon his or her early retirement, normal retirement or disability, or a death benefit to a
	named beneficiary in the event of the named executive officers death. The benefit under the plan is $100,000, payable monthly over a 15 year period, upon the named executive officers early retirement, normal retirement or disability and,
	in the event of a named executive officers death, the benefits will be paid to his or her beneficiary.    Should the named executive officer separate from service prior to his or her early retirement, normal retirement,
	disability or death, he or she forfeits all benefits under the plan. In addition, if within three years following his or her separation from service, a named executive officer becomes engaged in the banking business within a certain geographic area
	around the Company, the named executive officer will forfeit all benefits under the plan.

	The Company has purchased life insurance contracts which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits.
	The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which is a general asset of the Company.


	The Deferred Compensation Plan was
	established in 1992, at which time Miss Wood became a participant. Mr. Fulmer became a participant upon his promotion to vice-president of the Bank.


	If separation from service occurs prior to a named executive officers normal retirement date, the named executive officer will be entitled to full
	benefits provided he or she has met the early retirement eligibility. The early retirement date means the first day of any month coincident with or following the month in which the named executive officer attains at least age 55 and has at least 10
	years of employment at the Company. The normal retirement date means the date the named executive officer attains age 65. As of December 31, 2016, Mr. Fulmer is the only named executive officer eligible to receive benefits under the
	Deferred Compensation Plan.


	If a named executive officer becomes disabled, he or she is entitled to full benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan.


	If the named executive officer dies prior to early retirement, normal retirement or disability, the named executive officers named beneficiary is
	entitled to full benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. If the named executive officer dies while receiving benefits, the named beneficiary is entitled to the remainder of any unpaid benefits.


	In the event of a change of control, unless the Deferred Compensation Plan is terminated by the transferee, purchaser or successor entity within 120 days of
	the change of control, no named executive officer will be entitled to a distribution under this plan as a result of the change in control. If the Deferred Compensation Plan is terminated within 120 days of a change of control, then each named
	executive officer will become immediately eligible to receive the present value of his or her benefits under this plan. In addition, in the event the Deferred Compensation Plan is continued but a named executive officer is involuntarily terminated
	within 180 days of a change of control, the terminated named executive officer will be eligible to receive his or her benefits under this plan. Such benefits will be calculated by taking the present value of the benefits provided and such benefits
	will be paid in a lump sum within 180 days of the change in control.



	Split-Dollar Agreement



	The Company owns endorsement split-dollar policies, of which the Bank is the owner and beneficiary, which provide a guaranteed death benefit of $150,000 to the
	Chief Executive Officers beneficiaries.



	Employee Stock Ownership Plan



	The Company maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan covering all eligible employees of the Company. The Board determines the total contribution to the Plan,
	which is allocated to all participants based on their compensation.



	401(k) Plan



	The Company maintains a 401(k) Plan in which eligible employees of the Company may choose to participate. The Board determines the formula for the matching
	contribution to the Plan, which is currently 75% of the employees contribution (up to 6% of compensation).

	G. Accounting and Tax Treatment:


	While the Compensation Committee considers the accounting and tax implications in the design of the compensation program, these have not had a significant
	impact in their decision-making process.





	H. Shareholder Approval of Compensation of Named Executive Officers:


	At our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the Company held its second advisory

	(non-binding)

	vote on the compensation
	of the named executive officers. A majority of our shareholders voted in favor of the resolution approving the 2015 compensation of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considered these shareholders votes in determining the
	2016 compensation of the named executive officers. Shareholders will be provided their next opportunity to cast an advisory

	(non-binding)

	vote on the compensation of the named executive officers at the 2019
	annual meeting of shareholders, at which time the frequency of submitting the compensation of the named executive officers to the shareholders in the future will be submitted for an advisory

	(non-binding)

	vote
	as well.


	There are no employment contracts with the executive officers.

	Directors Compensation



	During 2016, directors who
	are employees of the Bank did not receive any compensation for serving on the Board of the Bank or the Company or on any Board committee.    All

	non-employee

	directors received an annual
	retainer of $3,500.

	Non-employee

	directors additionally receive $500 per board meeting attended and $300 per committee meeting attended. The chairman of the Audit Committee received $500 per audit committee
	meeting attended. The chairman of all other committees received $400 per committee meeting attended.


	The Company offers a Directors Deferred Income
	Plan whereby directors of the Company and the Bank are given an opportunity to defer receipt of their annual directors fees. For those who choose to participate, benefits are payable monthly for 10 years beginning on the first day of the month
	following the later of the directors normal retirement age or separation from service. Normal retirement age is 65. The amount of the benefit will vary depending on the fees the director has deferred and the length of time the fees have been
	deferred.    Interest on deferred fees accrues at an annual rate of 10%, compounded annually. After payments have commenced, interest accrues at an annual rate of 7.50%, compounded monthly. In the event of the directors
	death, benefits are payable to the directors named beneficiary. The Company has purchased life insurance contracts which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance
	policies, which are a general asset of the Company.


	The Company also offers an Outside Directors Supplemental Income Plan to provide a benefit to
	its

	non-employee

	directors. The benefit is based upon the age of the Outside Director upon his appointment to the board. Directors Drew Allen and Dan Magruder are entitled to receive $5,000 annually for 10
	years, Director Rex E. Kelly is entitled to receive $4,000 annually for 10 years and Director


	 


	17






	Jeffrey H. OKeefe is entitled to receive $6,000 annually for 10 years. The benefit is payable upon the later of the Outside Directors attainment of age sixty-five or cessation of
	service as a director. An Outside Director must serve as an Outside Director until the earlier of his death or 10 consecutive years as an Outside Director to be entitled to any benefit. In the event of the death of the Outside Director, their
	beneficiary shall receive a death benefit totaling the remainder of benefits due the Outside Director. The death benefit will be paid in a single lump sum within 90 days following the Outside Directors death. The Company has purchased life
	insurance contracts which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which are a general asset of the Company.

	(1) In prior years, Mr. Swetman had received fees for serving on the Board of Directors and had deferred such fees under
	the Directors Deferred Income Plan.



	VII. Transactions with Related Parties



	In the ordinary course of business, the Company, through its bank subsidiary, extends loans in the ordinary course of business to certain officers and
	directors and their personal business interests at, in the opinion of Management, the same terms including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable loans of similar credit risk with persons not related to
	the Company or its subsidiaries. These loans, which are subject to approval by the Companys Board of Directors, do not involve more than normal risk of collectability and do not include other unfavorable features. Other than these
	transactions, there were no material transactions with any such persons during the year ended December 31, 2016.



	VIII. Section
	16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance



	Directors, executive officers of the Company and holders of more than 10 percent of the
	Companys outstanding shares are required to file reports under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Federal


	regulations require disclosure of any failures to file these reports on a timely basis. Based solely upon a
	review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 furnished to the Company, the Company believes that during 2016 its officers, directors and greater than 10 percent beneficial owners complied with all filing requirements.


	 


	18

	X. Audit Committee Report



	The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, whose responsibilities are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter. All members of the Audit
	Committee are deemed to be independent, as such term is defined by NASDAQ. The Audit Committee oversees the operation of the Companys Audit Department. The Audit Committee also periodically meets with the independent public accountants for the
	Company and its subsidiaries, and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning any matters related to the independent public accountants.


	The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with Management. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent
	auditors the matters required to be discussed by SAS 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors independence, and has
	received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors communication with the Audit Committee
	concerning independence. The Audit Committee has considered whether the independent auditors provision of

	non-audit

	services is compatible with maintaining the auditors independence.


	The Audit Committee has discussed with Management and the independent auditors the process used for certifications by the Companys chief executive
	officer and chief financial officer which are required for certain periodic filings by the Company with the SEC. The Board of Directors maintains an Audit Committee Charter, which meets the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and rules
	promulgated by the SEC.


	 


	19






	Based upon the reviews and discussions with Management and the independent auditors as referenced above, the
	Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 for filing with the SEC.


	This report is presented by the Audit Committee, consisting of the following persons:


	 




















	Dan Magruder, Chairman


	 


	Drew Allen


	 


	Rex E. Kelly


	 


	Jeffrey H. OKeefe





	XI. Independent Accountants Fees



	The Companys Audit and

	Non-Audit

	Service

	Pre-Approval

	Policy stipulates
	that all services provided by the independent accountants are subject to specific

	pre-approval

	by the Audit Committee. During 2016, the Company was in compliance with this Policy.


	The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed by Porter Keadle Moore, LLC, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 for professional
	services rendered for: Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees and Tax Fees. Audit Fees includes aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Porter Keadle Moore, LLC, for the audit of the Companys annual consolidated financial
	statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, a review of the annual report on Form

	10-K

	and limited reviews of quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements included in periodic
	reports filed with the SEC during 2016 and 2015, including out of pocket expenses. Audit-Related Fees include fees billed for professional services rendered by Porter Keadle Moore, LLC, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which
	relate to the audit of the Companys employee benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Tax Fees include the aggregate fees billed for tax services rendered by Porter Keadle Moore, LLC, during the years ended
	December 31, 2016 and 2015. These services consisted of tax compliance and tax consultation services. There were no other fees paid to Porter Keadle Moore, LLC, during 2016 and 2015.
