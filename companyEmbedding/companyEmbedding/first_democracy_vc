World's Largest Online Investment Conference To Provide 250 Tickets to Investors

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 24, 2017 /Crowd Invest Summit has announced that Indiegogo has joined its sponsor roster for CIS West 2017.
Crowd Invest Summit will provide 250 investors a ticket to attend the summit, and will provide every actively fundraising company on First Democracy VC, an equity crowdfunding portal presented by Indiegogo and MicroVentures, a presence on the expo floor.
"We're very excited to participate in Crowd Invest Summit to give our investors and companies a venue to meet each other, as well as our team, in real life," said Michael Hughes, Senior Director of Equity Crowdfunding at Indiegogo. "We're very supportive of any activities that support the burgeoning equity crowdfunding industry here in the U.S."
Crowd Invest Summit, which will be keynoted by CNBC star and Billionaire Investor Marcus Lemonis, is the world's largest event of it's kind and will be hosted at the Los Angeles Convention Center in downtown Los Angeles to accommodate the over 3,000 anticipated investor and entrepreneur attendees.
"We are very proud to welcome Indiegogo, a crowdfunding trailblazer for so many years and who has recently entered the equity crowdfunding space in a big way, to CIS West 2017. We share a vision of connecting companies with investors and we look forward to their participation at the conference" said Crowd Invest Summit Co-Founder Josef Holm.
Crowd Invest Summit was developed with the vision that every American, through the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (also known as the JOBS Act), can now have access to and invest in startups and real estate deals like never before through crowdfunding.
Equity Crowdfunding: Opportunity for All:
Prior to the JOBS Act, mostly accredited investors - those with income of $200,000 per year individually, or $300,000 with a spouse - could legally invest in private companies. Now, for the first time in more than 80 years, anyone over 18 globally is able to invest. With a recent study by theKauffman Foundation finding that angel investments have returned an average of 27% internal rate of return (IRR), everyday Americans have started to invest in companies to support the entrepreneurs they believe in and with hopes of generating profits.

Frequently asked questions




What is equity crowdfunding?
With equity crowdfunding, you get a financial stake in the company you’re supporting. Indiegogo and MicroVentures, two leaders in the crowdfunding and investing space, created an equity crowdfunding platform, First Democracy VC, that allows financial investment in innovative startups. Equity crowdfunding has risks and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.
Who can invest?
Any individual 18 years and older can invest, as well as any eligible entity. If you live outside the US, please check your local securities laws but we are allowing most countries access to invest when the laws allow it.
How much does it cost?
It’s free to create a profile and you will only be charged an investment processing fee if you make an investment.
How much can I invest?
Individual investments start at US$100, but startups set the minimum they will accept. Investors will have investment maximums based on a few factors, including earnings, net worth, etc.


How does investing work?
Investing in startups means you own a piece of the company and are along for the ride, whether up or down. With this partnership, all investment transactions take place on MicroVentures.com.
How many shares do I get?
Each offering company decides how much money they want to raise, what they want to offer, and what the price should be. The offering terms are noted on their page.
What information do I receive before and after investing?
Before you invest, each company is required to show how they plan to use the money raised and other financial information. After investing, each company is required to routinely share information about how their businesses are doing.
How does it work after my investment is made, what is the next step?
After you make your investment we will process your investment and the funds will sit in escrow until the investment closes. If the minimum goal is hit by the end of the round we will notify you of the close and provide documentation regarding your investment.

While wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have revolutionized how we access music, the never-ending changes in technology have also required consumers to regularly purchase new equipment to maintain the best audio experience. Today, speakers are also often made of outsourced plastic parts to keep prices low and to keep consumers coming back for the latest device.Conversely, the highest-quality musical instruments are made of specific woods that are carefully chosen based on their resonant properties. Princeton Audio believes that this same thoughtful process should be applied to the creation of premium audio equipment. Founded in 2014, the company is dedicated to the creation of high-quality, handcrafted audio products while reclaiming and rejuvenating the proud history of local manufacturing in Princeton, Wisconsin. With its patented, readily upgradeable technology, Princeton Audio is designing speakers that can once again be viewed as timeless pieces.ProductPrinceton Audio’s Site:1 speakers are individually tuned to take advantage of the unique acoustic properties of each hardwood and boast sophisticated, upgradeable electronics that deliver audiophile-quality sound. Each speaker is equipped with audiophile technology, including a high-quality Digital Signal Processor (DSP), a digital-analog converter, and the latest high-resolution A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) Bluetooth 4.x technology. Each Site:1 is handcrafted in Princeton, Wisconsin, from solid, instrument-grade hardwoods (tonewoods).The Site:1 is available in four premium tonewoods – black walnut, cherry, mahogany, and maple – each with its own unique voice.  Black Walnut: Black walnut features a straight, prominent grain pattern with a deep brown, chocolate hue. Black walnut is used in high-end guitar crafting, piano construction, and other premium applications. Known for its responsive curve and tight bass, black walnut produces a clean sound, with a strong emphasis on mid-tones, and a superior low-end response relative to the other tonewoods.Cherry: Cherrywood has a simple, yet elegant straight-grain pattern, with a light reddish-brown hue. Less commonly used as a tonewood today due to its high cost, cherry has a long history in high-end string instrument crafting. Cherrywood emphasizes mid-tones, resulting in a crisp, balanced sound, highlighting the tonal nuances of vocal performances. Mahogany: Mahogany, a favorite of makers of stringed instruments ─ known as luthiers’ mahogany ─ is a “go-to” in the crafting of acoustic guitars, bass guitars, and many other stringed instruments. This tonewood is often described as “earthy” due to its unique crossgrain structure. With a responsive mid range, mahogany highlights more natural and mellow sounds.Maple: With a bright, crisp sound, and creamy white complexion, maple’s light and bright appearance is belied by its strength and considerable heft. Maple is a dense, hard, heavy wood capable of capturing the widest spectrum of the tonewood options. As the hardest of the four tonewoods, Maple does not resonate as much as the others, producing a higher definition of sound. With bright and crisp tonal properties, maple wood does not lose the subtle background noises that give life to live music and provides a true “in-person” listening experience.Future-ProofedThrough Princeton Audio’s patented Adaptable Audio Systems technology, the Site:1 is optimized to integrate into almost any wired or wireless system, including music players, televisions, game consoles, and portable devices. The Site:1 also enjoys compatibility with a wide range of current connectivity options such as Bluetooth 4.x and aptX.Another unique aspect of the Site:1 is that its external interface is engineered to be easily upgraded, allowing users to adapt to future technological changes in the decades to come. For example, when the world finally sees the arrival of Bluetooth 5.0, or a more robust form of Wi-Fi distribution, Princeton Audio can simply update the interface that plugs into the back of a user’s Site:1 system.Covering All the AnglesThrough its cabinet design, Princeton Audio speakers produce crystal-clear sound by creating an optimum environment for converting audio signals into corresponding sounds. The triangle shape eliminates what’s known as standing waves. A rectangular box, like most Bluetooth speakers, has parallel walls which cause sound waves to hit each other squarely and bounce off. These waves cancel each other out, or “stand” on each other, making them inaudible. When users hear a humming or buzzing coming from a rectangular speaker, it’s usually caused by these standing waves. Site:1’s triangle shape eliminates this possibility.Site:1 Tech SpecificationsAccessoriesCustomers can choose from a standard 15+ hour rechargeable battery for their Site:1 or upgrade to a 40+ hour rechargeable battery for $50 extra. They can also further customize their Site:1 speakers with premium hardware sets for the acoustic grille and volume knob. Premium grille options include decorative plating in anodized silver, anodized black, and 24-karat gold. Handmade shoulder slings made of genuine leather are also available so users can more easily take the Site:1 wherever they go.Use of Proceeds and Product RoadmapMost of the proceeds (60% to 70%) from this raise will be used to scale manufacturing of the Site:1 speaker and build up inventory. Additionally, proceeds will be allocated towards future payroll (30% to 40%) as the company plans to hire additional staff, including a marketing executive, controller, and sales representatives.Additionally, the company may use part of the manufacturing allocation to complete development of the company’s next product, the Site:Woofer. The product development and engineering team is currently working on the release of the Site:Woofer, a subwoofer that augments the sound of the Site:1 speaker with stronger bass and even greater presence. Featuring a cabinet made with the same high-touch craftsmanship as the Site:1, the Site:Woofer is wirelessly compatible with Site:1 speakers and can function as a standalone speaker. The Site:Woofer will be able to pair with up to two speakers or, for even more bass, consumers may purchase two Site:Woofers and synch each with a different Site:1. The company expects to begin shipping the subwoofer in Fall 2017.Princeton Audio is also currently engineering premium, customizable headphones. With a patent pending for interchangeable earcups, the headphones will feature the same high-quality tonewoods as the Site:1 speakers and have wired/wireless capability and over-ear/on-ear options.Business ModelThe Site:1 speaker retails for $335 with a 15+ hour battery, or $385 with a 40+ hour battery.The plated 24K gold grille option is $35 extra. The leather slings retail for $65 each. Users may also purchase additional premium hardware sets; anodized copper or anodized black sets for $44.99, or the 24K gold set for $59.99.Pre-orders for the Site:Woofer will be $450 per unit, with an expected retail cost of $599.99.   User Traction Princeton Audio launched an Indiegogo campaign in September 2015 for the Site:1 speaker. Within two months, the deal was oversubscribed, and the company raised a total of $63,271 from 274 backers.Since shipments began on July 31, 2016, Princeton Audio has delivered over 500 speakers. In 2016, it sold over 513 units of the Site:1 speaker. In Q1 2017, 190 units were ordered, up 26.6% from Q4 2016 (a holiday quarter). In the first two months of Q2 2017, Princeton Audio already has surpassed 200 units ordered. While most units have shipped, the current backlog, as of May 2017, was under 150 speakers.   Historical Financials In 2016, Princeton Audio generated $154,149 in total income. Year to date, as of May 2017, the company has already surpassed $136,000 in total income. Shipments of the Site:1 speaker peaked in September 2016 and April 2017, during which time Princeton Audio processed a large portion of its customer backlog. In February 2017, sales were minimal as the company focused its efforts on raising capital. During Q1 2017 and into Q2, Princeton Audio raised roughly $125,000 in a seed equity round.In 2016, operating expenses totaled $226,237. Monthly operating expenses peaked in September, when the company spent roughly $30,000 on research and development. In Q4 2016, expenses declined primarily due to a decrease in advertising spend. Additionally, in December 2016, the company reversed roughly $50,000 legal & professional fees, resulting in negative total operating expenses for the month. Year to date, as of May 2017, operating expenses have totaled $161,363, up roughly 75% from the same period in 2016. Expenses have increased in 2017 primarily due to a larger payroll as the company has hired additional employees.Princeton Audio had a net operating loss of $207,838 in 2016. Year to date, as of May 2017, its net operating loss was $81,119, an improvement of about 4% from the same period in 2016. In 2017, the company’s monthly net operating loss widened in March, April, and May as the company made large inventory purchases to meet customer orders and to better improve their lead time for future orders. As of May 2017, Princeton Audio had over $85,000 in current cash assets.   Industry and Market Analysis In 2016, the home audio market was worth $19.5 billion, a 16% increase from 2015. Global revenue is predicted to continue increasing for the next five years, potentially exceeding $31 billion by 2021.ii The global wireless audio market ─ which includes speakers, headphones, and microphones ─ is expected to be even larger than home audio; it was valued at $13.25 billion in 2015, but it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20.67% to reach $40.9 billion by 2021.iii  Consumer demand for audio products that come with built-in Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi is being driven by the desire to wirelessly play music from a smartphone or tablet, or from music services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora, onto a speaker located either inside or outside the home.

That meant designing and engineering amazing-sounding and even more amazing-looking, portable Hi-Fi products.Beth Pelland, Director of Customer Service: Beth brings over 20 years of sales and customer service background to Princeton Audio.

Derek worked closely with the founder, Dana Bourgeois, for the better part of a decade. At Princeton Audio, he will help the team assemble and test the speakers.

A: Sure, if that’s one of your goals. You’ll learn how to vet companies, what the job of an entrepreneur is like, what VCs do, what kinds of companies people are starting and what areas are hot, how to sell a product to people, and how to find the very best people.

Early Stage Vs. Late Stage Companies 
The startup lifecycle spans idea generation to an eventual exit through an acquisition, initial offering, liquidation, or failure with several inflection points throughout.

Seed and Early Stage Investments
Seed and early stage companies are typically seeking capital to invest in product development, building a team of employees, and formalizing customer acquisition strategies. While seed stage companies are focused on product development, early stage companies typically have a handful of users testing a beta product while fine-tuning their go-to-market strategy and building out sales channels.

• Focused on product development and preparing for a broader market launch.
• Product is usually in use by early beta customers for testing and feedback.
• Typically cash-constrained and seeking its first outside investors through family, friends, and angel investors.
Investments within this stage typically take two forms: convertible notes and preferred equity. The form of investment is dependent on the company’s relative maturity with seed stage investments typically structured as convertible notes while early stage companies issue preferred equity in exchange for investor funds. In institutional venture capital terms these are known as Series Seed, Series A, and at times Series B.
• Officially launched and focused on customer acquisition.
• Implementing its sales channel strategy and attempting to reach breakeven cash flow.
• Generating revenue but pursing additional capital from institutional investors to invest in customer acquisition and business development.
 
Late-Stage Investments
Late stage companies have typically demonstrated viability as a going concern and generally have a well-known product with a strong market presence. Late stage companies have generally reached a point of positive cash flow generation and begin to experiment with expanding into tangential markets. Regardless, investments in both early-stage and late-stage companies involve a considerable amount of risk.
• Well-known product which has successfully penetrated its initial market and learned where and how to move next.
• May be cash flow positive and introducing its product into tangential markets.
• Investors are seeking liquidity as the company begins to position itself for an acquisition or an initial public offering.
Investments made early in a company’s lifecycle typically require a long holding period and can be riskier relative to a late stage companies. Understanding the lifecycle stage at which an investment will be made is paramount in accurately capturing the risks and return characteristics associated with that investment.
Risks Involved
Investments in early-stage and late-stage companies are highly speculative and involve significant risks due to, among other things, inconsistent cash flows, the competitive landscape, and short operating cycles. These investments are generally illiquid and highly speculative, and are not suitable for anyone without a high tolerance for risk and/or low liquidity needs. You should invest only if you are able to bear the risk of losing your entire investment. There can be no assurance that subscribers will receive any return of capital or profit.

Crowd Invest Summit (CIS) has announced that Indiegogo and their equity crowdfunding vertical has joined it’s roster for CIS West 2017. CIS organizers have shared they will be providing 250 investor tickets to actively back early stage ventures listed on First Democracy VC, the equity crowdfunding portal managed by Indiegogo and MicroVentures.
Earlier this year, CIS announced that Marcus Lemonis, a Billionaire investor and CNBC star, has agreed to keynote was is billed as the largest event of its kind. Scheduled to take place at the Los Angeles Convention Center, CIS West expects to garner more than 3000 attendees.
Michael Hughes, Senior Director of Equity Crowdfunding at Indiegogo; commented on the upcoming event;
“We’re very excited to participate in Crowd Invest Summit to give our investors and companies a venue to meet each other, as well as our team, in real life,” said Hughes. “We’re very supportive of any activities that support the burgeoning equity crowdfunding industry here in the U.S.”.
Organizers explain that CIS was developed with the vision that every American, through the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (also known as the JOBS Act), can now have access to and invest in startups and real estate deals like never before through investment crowdfunding.
“We are very proud to welcome Indiegogo, a crowdfunding trailblazer for so many years and who has recently entered the equity crowdfunding space in a big way, to CIS West 2017. We share a vision of connecting companies with investors and we look forward to their participation at the conference” said Crowd Invest Summit Co-Founder Josef Holm.
Prior to the JOBS Act, the legislation that legalized crowdfunding in the US, mostly accredited investors – those with income of $200,000 per year individually, or $300,000 with a spouse – could invest in private companies. Now, for the first time in more than 80 years, anyone over 18 globally is able to invest.
One study, authored by the Kauffman Foundation, stated that angel investments have returned an average of 27% internal rate of return (IRR) in a diversified portfolio. Today, everyday Americans have started to invest in companies to support the entrepreneurs they believe in and with hopes of generating profits.
Crowd Invest Summit was founded by pioneers in the equity crowdfunding sector Josef Holm and Alon Goren and is schedule to take place on LA this September.
