About Venture Capital Trusts
Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) were introduced by the UK Government in the 1995 Finance Act to encourage individual UK investors to invest in young, high-growth British companies. The Government sought to achieve this by offering a number of generous and attractive tax benefits to UK individuals who invest in a VCT.
For individual investors, an investment in a VCT can represent a tax efficient way of building a portfolio of indirect investments in a range of companies. For high-growth British companies, VCTs represent a source of expansion capital for the development of their business.


Risk Warning
The value of an investment in IBIS VCT or any other VCT may go down as well as up and you may not get back the full amount invested. An investment in a VCT may be higher risk than investing in other securities listed on the London Stock Exchange’s official list and may be more difficult to realise. You should not invest in IBIS VCT or any other VCT unless you have carefully thought about whether you can afford it and whether it is right for you.
You should regard an investment in IBIS VCT or any other VCT as a longer term investment. We recommend that you seek independent financial advice from an appropriately authorised independent financial adviser as to whether an investment in IBIS VCT or any other VCT is suitable for you, as well as your personal entitlement to any tax reliefs associated with an investment in a VCT. The share price of a VCT may not reflect its net asset value.


Investment Focus
IBIS Media VCT principally invests in smaller unquoted companies, although Alternative Investment Market (AIM) listed companies will also be considered. IBIS Media VCT will consider providing finance for a range of different situations including:

Expansion capital for fast growing companies looking to develop their business
Finance for companies looking to make an acquisition
MBO/MBI finance for management teams looking to buy a company or business from its existing owners
Pre-IPO finance for companies preparing to float on the AIM

The objective of IBIS Media VCT is to develop a balanced investment portfolio that has potential for capital appreciation.  The characteristics of an investee company can typically be expected to include:

A sustainable business model
Competitive advantage
A strong management team
Organic revenue growth potential
Profitability, or the expectation of profitability within a reasonable timeframe

In order to mitigate investors’ risk, investments in business start-ups will generally be avoided unless the management team has a strong profile in the media sector and a prior track record of value creation for shareholders.

Terms of Use
The information on this website relating to funds advised by IBIS Private Equity Partners LLP is directed at United Kingdom residents only. An investment in any VCT advised by IBIS Private Equity Partners LLP must only be made on the basis of the information set out in the relevant prospectus. The investments referred to on this website may not be suitable for all investors. Investors should seek advice from a financial adviser. IBIS Private Equity Partners LLP does not provide and nothing on this website should be construed as investment or tax advice.
The past performance of VCTs or other investment products is not a guide to the future performance. The value of an investment may go down as well as up, in which case an investor may not get back the amount invested. The share price of a VCT may not reflect its net asset value. VCTs often invest in unquoted companies which are small and which carry an above-average level of risk and whose shares may not be readily marketable.
The tax reliefs available to certain investors in VCTs are dependent on the VCT maintaining Inland Revenue approval. If this approval is withdrawn, a VCT will lose its status and all tax reliefs are likely to be cancelled. Investors must retain their VCT shares for a minimum holding period to retain the up-front income tax relief. The tax rules and regulations governing VCTs are subject to change. Prospective investors in VCTs should ensure that they read the risk warnings set out in the relevant prospectus.
