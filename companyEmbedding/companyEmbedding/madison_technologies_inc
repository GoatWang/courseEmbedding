(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  THE FOLLOWING PRESENTATION OF THE PLAN OF OPERATION OF MADISON TECHNOLOGIES INC. SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN.  Overview  Madison was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 15, 1998 under the name "Madison-Taylor General Contractors, Inc." Effective May 24, 2004, Madison changed its name to "Madison Explorations, Inc." by a majority vote of the shareholders. Effective March 9, 2015, Madison changed its name to "Madison Technologies Inc," by a majority vote of the shareholders. See Exhibit 3.3 - Certificate of Amendment for more details.  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a product license agreement dated September 16, 2016 between Tuffy Packs, LLC and Madison Technologies Inc. Tuffy Packs has granted an exclusive license to Madison for the distribution of Tuffy Pack's product line (collectively, the "Licensed Products") into the United Kingdom and 43 European countries. According to the terms and conditions of the product license agreement Madison will pay an aggregate amount of $50,000 for the exclusive license to distribute the Licensed Products in Europe. See Exhibit  Madison Technologies Inc. Form 10-K - 2016 Page 9  Tuffy Packs manufactures a line of custom inserts that provide a level of personal protection from ballistic threats similar to what law enforcement officers wear daily as bullet proof vests. The ballistic panels conform to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IIIA threat requirements.  Results of Operation for the Period Ended December 31, 2016  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred net losses of $66,089, compared to our net losses in fiscal 2015 of $64,485. Our losses in the current fiscal year were slightly lower due to lower general and administrative expenses that we incurred in connection with our preparation and filings.  We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to complete our proposed business plan. For these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2016, Madison had total assets of $57,019, and a working capital deficit of $316,708, compared with a working capital deficit of $265,750 as of December 31, 2015. The increase in the working capital deficit was primarily due to an increase in interest accrued on notes payable debt, the balance owing on the license agreement and an increase in convertible notes payable arising from interest recognition on discount. The assets consisted of $14,259 in cash and $42,760 in a license agreement. The liabilities consisted of $30,114 in accounts payable ($36,315 in 2015), $114,683 in notes payable and accrued interest ($107,592 in 2015), $146,013 in convertible notes payable ($122,083 in 2015), $33,500 in license fee payable and $261 due to a related party.  There are no assurances that Madison will be able to achieve further sales of its Common Stock or any other form of additional financing. If Madison is unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then Madison will not be able to continue its plan of operations and its business will fail.  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities increased to $30,742 compared with $27,729 for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The use of cash was primarily due to a net loss of $66,089 less a non cash items of interest on the convertible debt of $23,930 of amortization of license of $7,240, accrued interest on note payable of $6,135 and gain on dissolution of subsidiary of $2,673 The use was reduced by an increase of $7151 in accounts payable .  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $16,500 for the purchase of licensing agreement during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with cash flow from investing activities of $nil for the same period in the previous fiscal year.  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  Net cash flows provided by financing activities increased to $61,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with financing activities of $25,000 for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The net cash provided by financing activities was due to the proceeds from convertible notes payable.  Plan of Operation  Madison's plan of operation for the next 12 months is to deliver the Licensed Products into the European and UK retail and wholesale markets via the use of online market and fulfilment services including but not limited to Amazon.eu, Redstag and MCS Fulfilment. By implementing these companies' services Madison will be able to establish a reliable supply chain that will receive delivery of the Licensed Products, warehouse the Licensed Products, package the Licensed Package as per each customer order, and ship the Licensed Products to the customer efficiently and cost effectively.  Madison Technologies Inc. Form 10-K - 2016 Page 10  Management expects to expand Madison's sales distribution strategy beginning in May 2017 and to be operational by September 2017, this includes the following components:  1. Initial inventory with an estimated cost of $10,000  2. Social media and online advertising of $10,000  3. Payments to be made under Product License Agreement of $33,500  Madison sales strategy is to develop online exposure through the use of social media marketing and sending demo packs of the Licensed Products to both online bloggers and established gun owner clubs. The demo packs will include both new products as well as examples of the products that have been tested and exposed to gunfire to demonstrate the products effectiveness.  In addition to the costs associated to Madison's sales and distribution strategy, management anticipates incurring the following expenses during the next 12 month period:  ? Management anticipates spending approximately $2,500 in ongoing general and administrative expenses per month for the next 12 months, for a total anticipated expenditure of $30,000 over the next 12 months. The general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to Madison's regulatory filings throughout the year, as well as transfer agent fees, annual mineral claim fees and general office expenses.  ? Management anticipates spending approximately $15,000 in complying with Madison's obligations as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as a reporting issuer in Canada. These expenses will consist primarily of professional fees relating to the preparation of Madison's financial statements and completing and filing its annual report, quarterly report, and current report filings with the SEC and with SEDAR in Canada.  As at December 31, 2016, Madison had cash of $14,259 and a working capital deficit of $316,708. Accordingly, Madison will require additional financing in the amount of $361,708 in order to fund its obligations as a reporting company under the Securities Act of 1934 and its general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months.  During the 12 month period following the date of this annual report, management anticipates that Madison will not generate any revenue. Accordingly, Madison will be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue its plan of operations. Management believes that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding Madison's plan of operations as it does not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. Rather, management anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of Madison's Common Stock. However, Madison does not have any financing arranged and cannot provide investors with any assurance that it will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of its Common Stock to fund its plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, Madison will not be able to acquire any interest in a new technology and its business plan will fail. Even if Madison is successful in obtaining equity financing and acquire an interest in a new technology, additional research and development will be required before a determination as to whether the technology will be commercially viable. If Madison does not continue to obtain additional financing, it will be forced to abandon its business and plan of operations.  Purchase of Significant Equipment  We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next 12 months.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Madison has no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect its liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.  Material Commitments for Capital Expenditures  Madison had no contingencies or long-term commitments at December 31, 2016.  Madison Technologies Inc. Form 10-K - 2016 Page 11  Going Concern  The independent auditors' report accompanying our December 31, 2016 and 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations  Madison is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item.  Critical Accounting Policies  Madison's financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. Management believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of Madison's financial statements is critical to an understanding of Madison's financial statements.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Madison regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Madison bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by Madison may differ materially and adversely from Madison's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.  Fair Value Measurements  Madison follows FASB ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", for all financial instruments and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. This new accounting standard establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. Madison defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, Madison considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Madison would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Madison has adopted FASB ASC 825, "Financial Instruments", which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. Madison has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Impairment losses on long-lived assets, such as mining claims, are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than their carrying value and, accordingly, all or a portion of such carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are then measured by comparing the fair value of assets to their carrying amounts.  Mar 30, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	NOTES
	TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	 






	MARCH
	31, 2017






	 






	Note
	1

	Interim Reporting







	 





	While
	the information presented in the accompanying interim three months consolidated financial statements is unaudited, it includes
	all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations
	and cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America. These interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company’s
	December 31, 2016 annual consolidated financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested
	that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company’s December 31, 2016 annual financial statements.
	Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected
	for the year ended December 31, 2017.





	 






	Note
	2

	Nature and Continuance of Operations






	 




	The
	Company was incorporated on June 15, 1998 in the State of Nevada, USA and the Company’s common shares are publicly traded
	on the OTC Bulletin Board.




	 




	Up
	until fiscal 2014, the Company was in the business of mineral exploration. On May 28, 2014, the Company formalized an agreement
	whereby it purchased assets associated with a smokeless cannabis delivery system. The Company planned to develop this system for
	commercial purposes. On December 14, 2014, this asset purchase agreement was terminated.




	 




	On
	January 21, 2015, a majority of the Company’s stockholders approved a consolidation of the issued and outstanding shares
	of common stock, on a 10 for 1 basis, thereby decreasing the issued and outstanding share capital from 113,020,000 to 11,302,000.
		On March 11, 2015, the Company effectively changed its name from Madison Explorations, Inc. to Madison Technologies Inc. and
	effected the stock consolidation. These financial statements give retroactive effect to both these changes.




	 




	On
	September 16, 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution product license agreement with Tuffy Packs, LLC to distribute
	products into the United Kingdom and 43 other essentially European countries. The Company will be selling ballistic panels which
	are personal body armors, that conforms to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IIIA threat requirements. The Company’s
	plan of operations and sales strategy include online and social media marketing, as well as attending various tradeshows and conferences.




	 




	Effective
	December 31, 2016, the Company dissolved its wholly owned subsidiary, Scout Resources Inc. (“Scout”) and assumed all
	the debt that Scout owed.




	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern,
	which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next twelve months. Realization
	values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments
	that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue
	as a going concern. At March 31, 2017, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had accumulated losses of $591,146
	since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
	is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations
	and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to
	address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related
	party advances. That said, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.

	Note

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies







	 





	T


	here
	have been no changes in accounting policies from those disclosed in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
	for the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 





	Note
	4

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	 




	The
	Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
	which may be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently
	issued would, if adopted, have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.





	 






	Note
	5

	License Agreement







	 





	The
	Company entered into an exclusive product license agreement on September 16, 2016 with Tuffy Packs, LLC, a Texas corporation,
	to sell Ballistic Panels in certain countries, essentially in Europe. The license is for a period of two years unless terminated
	and may be renewed for successive terms of two years each. The payment terms for the license is as follows:




	 





	 



	1.




	$10,000
	payable within seven days after the effective date;





	 



	2.




	An
	additional $15,000 payable within 30 days after the effective date; and





	 



	3.




	A
	final payment of $25,000 payable within 90 days of the effective date.

	March 31, 2017, the Company had paid $16,500 to the Licensor, leaving an unpaid balance of $33,500. To Date, the Company has recorded
	a total license amortization of $13,490.




	 




	As
	a result of the failure to make payments as required under the agreement, the Company was informed on March 20, 2017, that going
	forward, the agreement would be on a non-exclusive basis.

	RESULTS
	OF OPERATIONS




	 




	Our
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
	unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
	expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.




	 





	Three
	months ended March 31, 2017 and March 30, 2016






	 





	Our
	net loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 was $20,296 (2016: $13,296), which consisted of general and administration
	expenses and amortization. We generated $1,420 in revenue during three-month period in fiscal 2017 compared to nil during
	the three-month period in 2016. The increase in expenses in the current fiscal year relate to an increase in both general and
	administrative expense and amortization expense related to our online store operations and the amortization of our Tuffy Pack
	licence agreement obligations.




	 




	The
	weighted average number of shares outstanding was 11,302,000 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 and 11,302,000 for
	the three-month period ended March 30, 2016.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 






	Cash
	and Working Capital






	 




	As
	at March 31, 2017, Madison had cash of $12,273 and a working capital deficit of $330,754, compared to cash of $14,259 and working
	capital deficit of $316,708 as at December 31, 2016.




	 




	There
	are no assurances that Madison will be able to achieve further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing.
	If Madison is unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then Madison will not be able to continue
	and its business will fail.




	 




	The
	officers and directors have agreed to pay all costs and expenses of having Madison comply with the federal securities laws (and
	being a public company, should Madison be unable to do so). Madison’s officers and directors have also agreed to pay the
	other expenses of Madison, should Madison be unable to do so. To continue its business plan, Madison will need to secure financing
	for its business development. Madison currently has no source for funding at this time.




	 




	If
	Madison is unable to raise additional funds to satisfy its reporting obligations, investors will no longer have access to current
	financial and other information about its business affairs

	Madison
	used cash of $1,986 in operating activities during the first three months of fiscal 2016 compared to cash used of $65 in operating
	activities during the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in the operating activities was principally a result
	of an increase in operating expenses.




	 





	Net
	Cash Provided (Used in) Investing Activities





	 




	Net
	cash used in investing activities was nil for the first three months of fiscal 2017 as compared with cash flow from investing
	activities of nil for the same period in the previous fiscal year.




	 





	Net
	Cash Provided by Financing Activities





	 




	Net
	cash flows provided by financing activities were nil for the first three months of fiscal 2017, from proceeds of a convertible
	note payable. Madison generated nil from financing activities during the first three months of fiscal 2016.




	 





	Plan
	of Operation





	 




	Our
	plan of operation is to continue to deliver the Tuffy Pack licensed products into the European and UK retail and wholesale markets
	via the use of online market and fulfilment services including but not limited to Amazon.eu, Ebay and Ecwid. By implementing these
	companies’ services Madison will be able to establish a reliable supply chain that will receive delivery of the Licensed
	Products, warehouse the Licensed Products, package the Licensed Package as per each customer order, and ship the Licensed Products
	to the customer efficiently and cost effectively.




	 




	Management
	expects to implement Madison’s sales distribution strategy beginning in May 2017 and to be operational by September 2017,
	this includes the following components:




	 






	 




	1.




	Initial
	inventory with an estimated cost of $10,000






	 




	 




	 






	 




	2.




	Social
	media and online advertising of $10,000






	 




	 




	 






	 




	3.




	Payments
	to be made under Product License Agreement of $33,500






	 




	Payments
	to be made under Product License Agreement of $50,000. At the date of this filing Madison has paid $16,500 of the $50,000.




	 




	Madison
	sales strategy is to develop online exposure through the use of social media marketing and sending demo packs of the Licensed
	Products to both online bloggers and established gun owner clubs. The demo packs will include both new products as well as examples
	of the products that have been tested and exposed to gunfire to demonstrate the products effectiveness.




	 




	Management
	anticipates incurring the following expenses during the next 12 month period:




	 






	 



	●





	Management
	anticipates spending approximately $2,500 in ongoing general and administrative expenses per month for the next 12 months,
	for a total anticipated expenditure of $30,000 over the next 12 months. The general and administrative expenses for the year
	will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to Madison’s regulatory filings throughout
	the year, as well as transfer agent fees, and general office expenses.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	●



	Management
	anticipates spending approximately $15,000 in complying with Madison’s obligations as a reporting company under the

	Securities Exchange Act of 1934

	and as a reporting issuer in Canada. These expenses will consist primarily of professional
	fees relating to the preparation of Madison’s financial statements and completing and filing its annual report, quarterly
	report, and current report filings with the SEC and with SEDAR in Canada.

	As
	at March 31, 2017, Madison had cash of $12,273 and a working capital deficit of $330,754. Accordingly, Madison will require
	additional financing in the amount of $375,754 in order to fund its obligations as a reporting company under the

	Securities
	Act of 1934

	and its general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months.




	 





	Risk
	Factors






	 





	An
	investment in Madison’s common stock involves a number of very significant risks. Prospective investors should refer to
	all the risk factors disclosed in Madison’s Form 10-K filed on April 15, 2009.





	 






	Going
	Concern





	 




	Madison
	has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive business activities.
	For these reasons, Madison’s auditors stated in their report that they have substantial doubt Madison will be able to continue
	as a going concern.




	 





	Future
	Financings





	 




	Management
	anticipates continuing to rely on equity sales of Madison’s common stock in order to continue to fund its business operations.
	Issuances of additional common stock will result in dilution to Madison’s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that
	Madison will achieve any additional sales of its common stock or arrange for debt or other financing to fund its planned activities.





	 






	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	Madison
	has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its
	financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
	or capital resources that is material to stockholders.




	 





	Material
	Commitments for Capital Expenditures





	 




	At
	March 31, 2017 Madison had an outstanding liability of $33,500 owing to Tuffy Packs LLC for the purchase of the Product Licensing
	agreement. As of the date of this filing Madison is in arrears $33,500 according to the Product Licensing Agreement. Please see
	Exhibit 10.5 Product License Agreement dated March 16, 2016 between Tuffy Packs, LLC and Madison Technologies Inc.




	 





	Tabular
	Disclosure of Contractual Obligations





	 




	Madison
	is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required
	under this item.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies






	 





	Madison’s
	financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
	States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application
	of accounting policies. Management believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
	with the following aspects of Madison’s financial statements is critical to an understanding of Madison’s financial
	statements.

	Use
	of Estimates






	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Madison regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
	related to the recovery of long-lived assets, donated expenses and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Madison bases
	its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that management believes to be
	reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
	and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced
	by Madison may differ materially and adversely from Madison’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between
	the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.





	 







	Item
	3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.





	 




	Madison
	is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required
	under this item.





	 







	Item
	4. Controls and Procedures.






	 







	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	Management
	maintains “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 (the “

	Exchange Act

	”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
	Madison’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
	Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
	Madison’s President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	In
	connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation
	of the President and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Madison’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
	defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of March 31, 2017.




	 




	Based
	on the evaluation and the identification of the material weaknesses in Madison’s internal control over financial reporting,
	as described in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, the President and the Chief Accounting Officer concluded that,
	as of March 31, 2017, Madison’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.




	 






	Changes
	in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting






	 




	There
	were no changes in Madison’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
	during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Madison’s
	internal control over financial reporting.




	 






	Limitations
	on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures






	 




	Management,
	including our President and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that Madison’s controls and procedures will prevent
	all potential error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
	assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
