Healthcare is undergoing a major transformation. With the emergence of IDNs, ACOs and MCOs, the approach to healthcare is evolving. The focus is on overall well-being and quality of life, rather than a one-time treatment. This requires a new patient-centric approach, complete understanding of the patient’s needs, behaviors and preferences and focus on building long-term relationships. Pharma, payers and providers collaborate to ensure better healthcare outcomes as new reimbursement models, like pay-for-performance get established. Healthcare organizations are working with PBMs to monitor adherence and fast initiation of new treatments. Healthcare providers are looking beyond product costs and working with distributors and GPOs to evaluate end-to-end supply-chain efficiencies.  In this changing healthcare environment, you need a modern approach to data management.With Reltio Cloud, you get a modern data management platform that fuels data-driven applications in support of all your patient-centric healthcare initiatives.Reltio Cloud enables a complete understanding of your patients, physicians and other partners across all clinics and facilities, with real-time visibility into relationships, healthcare metrics and utilization trends by the site of care. PATIENT 360 Meeting today’s goals of patient-centricity, lowering readmission rates and ensuring adherence requires complete patient understanding. Blending all patient profile information including EMR, lab results, omnichannel interactions and transaction, claims and reimbursement info. into a single easy to use data-driven application helps HCOs to provide better care.Understanding patient relationships with HCPs, caregivers, therapists, and family members provides new insights into patient’s support structure. Healthcare organizations can now utilize all this data for further insights like readmission risk and present to the HCP within the patient profile for timely actions.MAKING GPO VALUE-CHAIN MORE EFFICIENT  Evolving reimbursement landscape is pushing healthcare providers to look beyond product costs and examine end-to-end supply-chain efficiency.  They are looking towards manufacturers, distributors, and GPOs to help them become leaner and more efficient while remaining patient-centric.  With Reltio, GPOs can provide additional value to healthcare organizations by uncovering all relationships across the supply-chain ecosystem and providing unprecedented economies using reliable data and relevant insights.

SnapLogic and Reltio Expand Partnership to Simplify Enterprise Data Management
Feb 22 17
SnapLogic and Reltio announced an expanded partnership to simplify enterprise data management based on their fast-growing cloud platforms, helping customers ensure connectivity, consistency and reliability of information across on-premise and cloud applications and data sources. Specifically, the two companies will embed SnapLogic's enterprise integration platform with Reltio Cloud, providing Reltio customers with a fast and easy path to integrate data sources with no coding -- and an onramp to broader usage of SnapLogic's Enterprise Integration Cloud. The two companies will also pursue joint sales, marketing and customer success programs to grow the market for self-service integration and data-driven business applications. Several joint customers, including AstraZeneca, ClubCorp and Shutterstock, already use SnapLogic and Reltio in concert to quickly and easily connect data sources to Reltio Cloud, accelerating data flow across the enterprise and enabling faster, more reliable business insight and operational execution. SnapLogic's Enterprise Integration Cloud accelerates data and process flow across cloud and on-premise applications, data warehouses, big data streams and IoT deployments. Unlike traditional integration software that requires painstaking, hand-crafted coding by teams of developers, SnapLogic makes it fast and easy to create scalable data pipelines that get the right data to the right people at the right time. Codeless integration eliminates "technical debt" while enabling analysts, data scientists and business users to create integrations in hours using visual drag-and-drop software. Under the hood, SnapLogic's powerful data streaming architecture delivers real-time processing with high throughput for faster data movement across the enterprise.

Reltio Cloud 2017.1 is in preview, and being used for enterprise-wide digital transformation business initiatives, which includes powering mission-critical, real-time operational applications, enabling cross-functional business initiatives.

The new Reltio Cloud 2017.1 release also offers out-of-the-box connectivity using SnapLogic and Dun & Bradstreet for easy data integration, powering account relationship management solutions and enriched account data: Expanded partnership with SnapLogicembeds SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud into Reltio Cloud. This gives companies who do not have a data integration tool a simplified and easier way to load and synchronize data to and from Reltio, accelerating time-to-value. The Reltio SnapLogic connector is currently available to early access customers. New Dun & Bradstreet partnership allows companies to power the next generation of account relationship management solutions. The combination of Reltio Cloud technology and Dun & Bradstreet data delivers a complete 360 degree view of accounts through reliable, relevant and personalised hierarchy and relationship information across people, products, and places to improve sales effectiveness and customer engagement. Out-of-the-box Data as a Service (DaaS) integration with Dun & Bradstreet enables organizations to enrich account data, and create multiple operational account hierarchies, contextual to specific business needs. The Reltio Dun & Bradstreet connector is currently available to early access customers.

Commercial Graph — Reltio Cloud - Data-Driven Applications - Master Data Management - Big Data




































































COMMERCIAL GRAPHInfinite data attributes, relationships and possibilities







The world we live in isn't just relational, so why should your data be stored that way? Reltio Commercial GraphTM is a columnar and graph hybrid store architected for today's agile enterprise. Unlike off the shelf graph databases, Reltio Commercial graph is infinitely scalable, handling master data management (MDM) and big data volumes with ease.Like graphs that power the most popular consumer data-driven applications, such as LinkedIn (Economic Graph), Google (Knowledge Graph) and Facebook (Social Graph), Reltio Commercial Graph powers a new generation of data-driven applications for the enterprise. As a core part of the Reltio Cloud, Reltio Commercial Graph works under the covers on your behalf to combine, relate and store an infinite number of attributes and relationships to rapidly deliver any type of data-driven application for any business need. Why didn't we use a popular off the shelf graph database like Neo4j?Reltio Cloud is designed to handle the most complex, multi-domain master data management (MDM) challenges, but at the same time, effortlessly bring together transactional, interaction, social and machine-generated data at scale. Just like LinkedIn, Google and Facebook, we built our own Commercial Graph hybrid, marrying together our years of experience with databases to handle both operational and analytical functions within the same data-driven application. We cover every possible scenario, so you can have the ultimate flexibility to solve any business challenge.No schema restrictionsFree from the shackles of relational data modeling, foreign key definitions and the challenges of defining complex relationships, Reltio Commercial graph completely changes the paradigm by combining data together, without having to first design an application and data model. From master data management (MDM) to big data volumes, you are able to imagine your data from any perspective.limitless, volume, variety, velocity and VeracityIt captures and automatically models a variety of structured and unstructured master, reference, transaction and activity data, without any volume restrictions. Reltio Commercial Graph continuously indexes all attributes so searches are lightning fast, and retains historical data changes for compliance, forever. Powering INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC ApplicationsReltio Commercial Graph powers a range of industry-specifc, data-driven applications. Simple configuration is all that is required to extend Reltio for any combination of attributes and relationships, relevant to your business. Why buy an off-the -shelf graph database, and then have to stitch together multiple technologies to create your own apps, when you can get it all within Reltio Cloud?

Each quarter, the editors at SearchDataManagement recognize a data management technology for innovation and market impact. The product selected this quarter is Reltio Cloud 2016.2 by Reltio Inc.








Product: Reltio Cloud 2016.2
Release Date: July 17, 2016

What it does
Reltio Cloud presents a master data management architecture that combines aspects of master data management (MDM) systems with analytics, machine learning and other capabilities. The software is hosted on the Amazon Web Services cloud and includes the Reltio Commercial Graph, which applies graph database technology to uncover important relationships between data elements and runs together with a Cassandra NoSQL database to speed operations. An available Apache Spark data processing engine is also used to provide analytics capabilities.


Why it matters
Today, a near-surfeit of unstructured data is challenging traditional approaches to master data management. Many examples among present master data management architecture are underpinned by some type of relational database that uses relational data models that, in turn, can require considerable time to update. As well, relational systems are not immediately amenable to dealing with unstructured data. Moreover, such systems are not necessarily adept at representing the kinds of complex relationships that may exist when social media is mixed with more traditional data types already hosted within an organization.

Reltio's graph database provides a nonrelational underpinning for master data management, while a Spark engine supports advanced analytics to garner a better view into data trends. Also, because the system is cloud-based, it is in a good position to support new applications in which data from the cloud provides the center of gravity. Meanwhile, Reltio principals come to their use of the new technologies with considerable experience in data management; having serving stints with such data management pioneers Siperian and Informatica.


What users say
Michael Allelunas said Reltio's underlying graph technology represents "a cornerstone" that allows users to work more effectively with unstructured data. Allelunas, general manager of information management at IMS Health, said he and his team had been working closely with Reltio software for about two years. IMS Health offers customer relationship management, campaign marketing management, KPI and other applications for the life sciences industry.
Allelunas said the life sciences and health industries are dealing with a ''data explosion'' of the unstructured kind. Reltio software, he said, allows his customers to bring in a wide variety of data assets without reformatting. He contrasted Reltio's flexibility with other master data management systems' rigidity.
"We have to deal with social data, patient data and more. It is difficult to both be nimble and to marry all these kinds of data to on-premises master data management solutions, because such systems take a lot of cost and effort to update," he said. The system offers flexibility for analytics and reporting, that helps ensure requests for reports can be produced more readily, he added.


Drill down

A separately licensed module known as Reltio Insights connects Reltio Cloud managed data with an Apache Spark-based analytical engine.
The system, tapping into the Reltio Commercial Graph, can point users to likely relationships that exist between customers and other entities.
A suggest mode can trigger a workflow to review and approve data change requests.
Bulk edit and custom actions allow any type of action to be applied to a filtered list of records or values.



Pricing
The company does not disclose pricing but states that pricing is "based on the number of unique consolidated profiles being managed, and the number of users accessing the platform."
