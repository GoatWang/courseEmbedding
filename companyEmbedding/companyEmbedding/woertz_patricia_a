Patricia A. Woertz,  (born March 17, 1953, Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.), American businesswoman who was named president and CEO of the agricultural processing corporation Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) in 2006.After studying accounting at Pennsylvania State University (B.S., 1974), Woertz joined the accounting firm Ernst & Young in Pittsburgh as a certified public accountant. She moved to Gulf Oil Corporation’s Pittsburgh office in 1977, expanding her purview to such areas as strategic planning, marketing, and the refinery business. Charged with handling asset divestitures as part of Gulf’s 1984 merger with Chevron Corporation, she next led Chevron’s upstream audit group in Houston. By 1991 Woertz headed Chevron’s strategic planning, and she soon advanced into other key positions, including president of Chevron International Oil Co. (1996–98) and of Chevron Products Co. (1998–2001). As the executive vice president of downstream operations (2001–06) for ChevronTexaco (the two petroleum firms merged in 2001), Woertz managed 30,000 employees around the world and handled all operations downstream of oil productions, from refineries to service stations.ADM’s selection of Woertz to run the company signaled the firm’s commitment to a nonfood branch of business: biofuels. By 2006 ADM already claimed nearly 30 percent of the American market in corn-derived ethanol (a market projected to double by 2012), and Woertz’s extensive oil-industry experience was expected to secure ADM’s position as a top global producer of crop-based fuels, even as the company dominated markets for soy, wheat, corn, and other food products.

      Sidelights
    

      As president and chief executive officer of food-processing giant Archer
      Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), Patricia A. Woertz is one of the most powerful
      female executives in the United States. With $36 billion in revenue, ADM
      ranks among the nation's largest companies—never before has
      such a U.S. powerhouse hired a woman for its top post. Woertz is a rarity
      in the world of executives—as of 2006, only eleven Fortune 500
      companies had female CEOs. Woertz, who cut her teeth by spending 29 years
      in the ranks of the male-dominated oil business, dismisses her gender. She
      prefers to think of herself as a CEO who happens to be a woman.
      "I'm fairly certain that Archer Daniels Midland
      didn't hire me because I'm a woman. I think my background
      and my performance mean more," she said in a statement shortly
      after accepting the job, according to the 
      
        San Diego Union-Tribune
      
      .
    

      Woertz was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on St. Patrick's Day
      in 1953. Her father, Chuck, worked in the business world, heading up a
      home-construction and development company. Woertz's mother, Vi, was
      a librarian who believed summer vacations should be used for educational
      purposes. As such, 
      Woertz and her brother, Chuck Jr., did not spend their summers dallying on
      the beaches like many of their peers. Instead, they toured corporate and
      industrial America.
    

      "My mother felt we'd be earning a living during our entire
      adult lives, and therefore believed we should spend summers in learning
      activities," Woertz once noted, according to the 
      
        Chicago Tribune
      
      . "Consequently, I got to see a plate glass factory in Pittsburgh,
      a U.S. Steel plant, and how Heinz made ketchup." Other vacation
      destinations included an oil refinery, a window factory, and the
      headquarters of Gulf Oil and Mellon Bank, which were both based in
      Pittsburgh. This early exposure to the manufacturing world made Woertz
      feel at ease in industrial settings and helped pave the way for her
      future. "Definitely there was a seed of inspiration sown
      there," Woertz told 
      
        Fortune
      
      's Jon Birger. "I've always enjoyed seeing how things
      are made."
    

      After graduating from high school, Woertz felt pulled to follow her
      passion for mathematics. Speaking at a leadership conference in 2004, in a
      speech titled "Stepping Up to Leadership in a Global World,"
      Woertz described how her love for math ultimately drove her into the
      corporate world. "If there was any one interest that might have
      signaled my future in business, it was probably that I liked math. I loved
      its complexity. I loved taking apart a really hairy problem, understanding
      its components, and then solving it." She acknowledged that running
      a corporation involves the same skills, just on an elevated level.
    

      When Woertz graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1974 with a
      degree in accounting, she was already an anomaly. In the early 1970s,
      there were not many women going into the field. A star pupil in her
      graduating class, Woertz received several job offers. She accepted a
      position with Ernst & Young in Pittsburgh as one of 200 recruits
      who joined the company that year. Of those 200, there was only one other
      woman. Woertz already had ambition and drive—she dreamed that one
      day she might become a partner in an accounting firm. Little did she know
      she possessed the business acumen to go even farther.
    

      During her time at Ernst & Young, Woertz worked with both small
      colleges and multinational firms. She developed close ties with one
      client, Gulf Oil Corp., and in 1977 Woertz left the accounting firm to
      join its forces. At the time, Gulf Oil was fortifying its internal
      auditing department because an investigation had uncovered that company
      executives had funneled millions of dollars into illegal campaign
      contributions. Woertz proved to be an invaluable numbers-cruncher and in
      1981, Gulf Oil transferred her to Houston to head up an audit team.
    

      The move was just one of the many relocations Woertz was forced to take
      while following her dreams and ambitions. Woertz married along the way and
      had three children, including a set of twins. Her husband, a logistics
      consultant, was supportive. Though Woertz is now divorced, she
      acknowledges her former husband's support helped open up her career
      path. "At one point, we sort of said to each other, 'Gee,
      somebody's career is going to have to take
      priority,'" she recalled to 
      
        Fortune
      
      . In the end, the couple followed her career plans.
    

      During the 1980s, Gulf Oil united with Chevron in the largest corporate
      merger to date. Under terms approved by the Federal Trade Commission, Gulf
      was ordered to sell off some of its operations, including a refinery, a
      pipeline company, and some 4,000 gas stations. Woertz was assigned to the
      team that handled the divestitures and was also charged with finding ways
      to pay down debt. The task afforded Woertz the opportunity to learn about
      assets and investments. Impressed with her financial insight in handling
      the job, Chevron invited Woertz to join its San Francisco office and work
      with strategic planning. In 1989, Woertz was appointed finance manager of
      Chevron Information Technology Co. and by 1991 had been named head of
      strategic planning.
    

      Woertz continued to make a name for herself at Chevron and in 1993 was
      named president of Chevron Canada, a refining and marketing subsidiary
      based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. By 1995, Woertz was
      president of Chevron International. In 2001, after the merger of Chevron
      and Texaco, Woertz became an executive vice president in charge of
      downstream operations (downstream refers to everything that is done with
      oil after it comes out of the ground). In this position, Woertz was in
      charge of keeping watch over the company's global refining,
      lubricant, and marketing businesses, as well as its supply and trading
      ventures. While downstream operations encompassed just one branch of the
      company, it was no small matter—the division typically raked in
      $100 billion in annual revenues. At its helm, Woertz was in charge of 19
      refineries and 30,000 employees in 180 countries.
    

      Woertz struggled at first. During the first part of 2002, earnings in her
      division tanked, dropping from $1.1 billion to $43 million. The slide was
      at-
      tributed to market problems, a weak economy, and operational glitches.
      Woertz fired her senior management team and reorganized the operation. She
      developed an action plan that called for lowering operating expenses,
      reducing refinery downtime, and cutting better oil deals. Through her
      cost-savings plan, Woertz turned a loss of $367 million in 2002 into a
      $3.25 billion profit in 2004.
    

      The job at Chevron gave Woertz firsthand experience with the global
      marketplace. In one two-week period, she visited operations in Costa Rica,
      Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and the Canary
      Islands. This global interfacing helped prepare her for the job at Archer
      Daniels Midland (ADM). Despite her love for the oil industry, Woertz took
      early retirement and left Chevron in February of 2006 to pursue other
      opportunities. By April, Woertz had been scooped up by Decatur,
      Illinois-based ADM, one of the world's largest farm-commodities
      processors. ADM takes products from farmers—like corn, wheat, and
      soybeans—and turns them into such products as chocolate, corn
      sweeteners, flour, and soymeal, among other things. Woertz, however, was
      brought on board to help ADM boost its corn-based ethanol business. As oil
      costs continue to rise, ADM is betting on the alternative fuel ethanol.
      ADM is the largest producer of ethanol in the United States and has been
      making it since the energy crisis of the late 1970s.
    

      Since then, ADM has been waiting patiently for ethanol demand to take off
      in the marketplace. By 2006, it looked like ethanol would likely become a
      key player in the alternative energy craze as state legislatures passed
      bills requiring that gas be blended with ethanol. In addition, big
      industry seemed to be jumping on the biofuel band-wagon—in the
      early 2000s, automakers began releasing vehicles that ran on gas as well
      as E85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent petroleum. In an
      effort to capture more of the ethanol market, ADM wanted to boost
      production worldwide by building about a dozen plants. ADM higher-ups
      thought Woertz's expertise might help in this area. Ethanol is a
      tricky product; it is highly corrosive and cannot be transported by
      pipeline. Greggory Warren, an analyst with the investment research firm
      Morningstar Inc., told the 
      
        Chicago Tribune
      
       that he believes ADM hired Woertz to help solve this problem. "She
      understands how to get the product from the processing plant to the
      consumer's gas tank," Warren said. "ADM is betting
      the future on energy products."
    

      Speaking to 
      
        Fortune
      
      , one former ADM manager acknowledged that Woertz had a tough job on her
      hands as only the eighth CEO in the company's 104-year history. In
      addition, the company had been run by a member of the Andreas family for
      decades. "By God, if you only knew the culture there. Bringing an
      outsider, a woman no less, into a company that's a bastion of
      lifers and good ol' boys—I can't tell you how huge a
      change that is."
    

      Upon joining ADM, Woertz's salary was set at $1.2 million. She also
      received a $1.5 million signing bonus in cash and stock. The high-powered
      executive took time to ease into the job and made an effort to get to know
      the company, and its employees, from directors to factory workers. During
      her first 100 days, she logged thousands of miles on the company's
      jets. She met with 4,000 employees and visited 32 of the company's
      operations. She also held a global town hall meeting through a Webcast
      that allowed employees from different locations across the world to ask
      her questions.
    

      When Woertz was hired at ADM, there was much talk about her being the
      first woman to run such a large company. Woertz downplayed her gender, as
      has always been her style. Even on the golf course, when she hits the
      green with business clients, Woertz refuses to start off on the
      women's tees that are incrementally closer to the hole. Though
      Woertz de-emphasizes her status as a woman, she does take time to speak to
      up-and-coming female business executives. She has spoken to the Women in
      Leadership Conference at the University of California-Berkeley and has
      been a commencement speaker at her alma mater. One of Woertz's
      children, Paula Lucchini, seems to be following her mother into the
      corporate jungle. After graduating with an engineering degree from the
      University of San Diego in 2005, she joined Chevron, stepping right into
      the male-dominated workforce her mother has spent her career navigating.
    

      Woertz believes her success is a direct result of her willingness to move
      around, take on new challenges, and find solutions. Getting the top job at
      ADM involved years of 80-hour workweeks and switching jobs every couple
      years to expand her experience. "I had a very pragmatic
      upbringing," Woertz noted in an online article posted on the
      website of the Penn State Smeal College of Business. "I'm
      not one to get stuck in doubt or to dwell on a dilemma. You make
      intelligent choices. You take reasonable risks. You calibrate, decide, and
      go forward with commitment."

The Most Powerful Women in Business






Nearly half the women on our list run huge companies—a record. And all are working hard to transform their businesses.

More CEOs, more industries, more power, more challenges. That’s the story of Fortune’s 2014 ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in ­Business, which features an all-time record of 24 large-company CEOs in its pages. Our women are leading—and in many cases pushing through difficult transformations—in heavy industries such as tech, energy, defense, and autos. Ginni Rometty, No. 1 for the third time running, continues to retool IBM. No. 2, Mary Barra, must fix General Motors from the inside out. And Marillyn Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed Martin and our fourth-ranked woman, is looking beyond defense for growth. Today eight of our top 10 MPW lead large industrial, tech, and consumer products companies.
It’s a long way from our original 1998 list, on which, we noted at the time, most members “came from industries with a premium on creativity,” such as advertising, media, and publishing, with “no top women at blue-chip firms.” Creativity is still a requirement for success, of course, but you no longer have to work in a “creative” industry to advance as a woman. Another common denominator is change: Seven of our top 50 were named to their jobs in the past year, and nine are newcomers to the list. That suggests more turnover at the upper echelons of business—which, it’s fair to say, is a very good thing for a whole lot of powerful women. —Jennifer Reingold
