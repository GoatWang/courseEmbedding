Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement that will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization and also provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments.
But, as with most things in life, an annuity does have limitations. If you decide to take your money out early, you may face fees called surrender charges. Plus, if you're not yet age 59½, you may also have to pay an additional 10% tax penalty on top of ordinary income taxes. Naturally, if you do take an early withdrawal, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced. 
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal. 
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company and it’s sold by prospectus. While it may take some time, you should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you.  Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees, and the expense of the underlying investment options.  
Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase. 
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)

A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
