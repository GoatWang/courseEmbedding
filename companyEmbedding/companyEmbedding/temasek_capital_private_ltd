Temasek Holdings Private Limited (abbreviated as Temasek) is a state-owned holding company that can be characterized as a national wealth fund owned by the Government of Singapore. Incorporated in 1974, Temasek owns and manages a net portfolio of S$275 billion[5] (as of 31 March 2017), with S$18 billion divested and S$16 billion invested during the year,[6] and 68% exposure to Asia - 29% Singapore and 39% Asia ex-Singapore.[7] It is an active shareholder and investor, and their investments are guided by four key themes - transforming economies, growing middle income populations, deepening comparative advantages and emerging champions. Its portfolio covers a broad spectrum of sectors including financial services, telecommunications, media and technology, transportation and industrials, life sciences and agribusiness, consumer and real estate, energy and resources, as well as multi-sector funds. Temasek has a multinational team of 630 people, in 10 global offices[8] including Singapore, New York, and most recently, San Francisco.[9]
Temasek is commonly referred to as a sovereign wealth fund, particularly by the press and research outlets based outside Singapore.[10] However, it has frequently disputed this terminology, and prefers to be referred to as an investment company, because it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms.[11] However, its sole shareholder (to which it distributes dividends) is Singapore's Ministry of Finance. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance has previously noted that even though "there is still no universally accepted definition of sovereign wealth funds", Temasek is required to abide by international guidelines for sovereign wealth funds.[12] Beginning in 2015, capital gains from Temasek are included in Singapore's government budget, contributing approximately S$3 billion [13] to the 2015 budget.
GIC Private Limited, which is owned by the Government of Singapore, owns Temasek Holdings and manages an estimated US$330 billion, funded by Singapore's foreign reserves. Temasek has credit ratings of “AAA/Aaa” by Standard & Poor's[14] Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service[15] respectively since their inaugural ratings in 2004. Temasek has also attained perfect quarterly scores[16] on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index,[17] a measure of the openness of government-owned investment funds. However, the purported difficulty in measuring transparency of sovereign wealth funds means that the existence of such an index itself is questionable.[18]

History[edit]
Incorporation[edit]
At the point of Singapore's independence in August 1965, the Government of Singapore had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (later split up into Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became Singapore Telecommunications). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's Economic Development Board (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.[19] During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies,[20] such as the Keppel Corporation (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the Royal Navy after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), ST Engineering (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the Singapore Armed Forces), and the shipping company Neptune Orient Lines.
In 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act[21] to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,[22] allowing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to focus on policymaking. Temasek's established mission was to contribute to Singapore's economic development, industrialisation, and financial diversification by nurturing effective and commercially driven strategic investments in and around Singapore.
Status[edit]
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a statutory board. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays taxes that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.
Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule[23] entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.[24] The President also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.
In a 2009 speech,[25] Ho Ching, Temasek's Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance. She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly[26] and independently[27] monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly[28] and accurately[29] disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).
Initial holdings[edit]
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares in the following companies, start-ups and joint ventures previously held by the Singapore Government. The companies included a bird park, a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill. The companies in bold below are still within the Temasek portfolio.

Governance framework[edit]
Temasek Charter[edit]
As an institution, Temasek is guided by the Temasek Charter,[189] a set of principles that guides the company's actions.
The Charter has three main principles:
1. Temasek is an active investor and shareholder.
2. Temasek is a forward looking institution.
3. Temasek is a trusted steward.
According to the first principle, Temasek "owns and manages its assets and makes investment and divestment decisions based on commercial principles with the aim of delivering sustainable value over the long term".
According to the second principle, Temasek is a "forward looking institution with a long term perspective. Through its "MERITT values" (meritocracy, excellence, respect, integrity, teamwork, and trust),[190] Temasek aims to "foster an ownership culture which aligns employee and shareholder interests".
According to the third principle, Temasek acts as "a responsible corporate citizen that safeguards its past reserves and engages people and communities based on the principles of sustainability and good governance".
Rights and obligations[edit]
As an investment company incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act, Temasek owns and manages its assets. This means that it can make business decisions relating to its portfolio with full commercial discretion under the guidance of its Board, such as increasing, holding, or decreasing its investment holdings to achieve maximum risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
Under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is one of the key Singapore entities with constitutional safeguards to protect its past reserves.
Key companies designated under the Singapore Constitution include the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, which manages the reserves of the Singapore Government. Other designated entities with constitutional safeguards for their respective past reserves under the Singapore Constitution are statutory Boards such as the Central Provident Fund Board and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Owner and shareholder[edit]
Guided by business tenets, Temasek operates with full flexibility without the involvement of its shareholders, Singapore's Ministry of Finance and the President of Singapore.
Temasek is wholly owned by the Minister for Finance, who under the Singapore Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act (Chapter 183) is a body corporate.
As such, Temasek provides annual statutory financial statements audited by an international audit firm, as well as periodic updates to its shareholder.
Temasek is a Singapore exempt private company exempted from disclosing any financial information publicly, but chooses to publish its Group Financial Summary and portfolio performance in its annual report, the Temasek Review.
Temasek also declares dividends annually, once they are deliberated and recommended by its Board for its shareholder's consideration at the annual general meeting. Temasek contributes to the Singapore Government budget via the dividends it pays to its shareholder and the tax on its profits.
The shareholder's right to appoint, reappoint, or remove Board members is subject to the President's approval, a measure put in place to safeguard the integrity of the Board and to protect the company's past reserves.
The appointment or removal of the CEO by the Board is also subject to the concurrence of the President.
Further to its normal fiduciary duties to the Company, the Board is also accountable to the President to ensure that every disposal of investment is transacted at fair market value.
Protection of Temasek's past reserves[edit]







According to the Singapore Constitution, Temasek's past reserves are those accumulated before the current term of Government while its current reserves are those accumulated during the current term of Government.
This means that on the eve of the first day of each term of Government, Temasek's total reserves – comprising past reserves and current reserves as at the changeover – are locked up as past reserves for the next term of Government. This cycle repeats every time there is a change in the term of Government.
The President of the Republic of Singapore has an independent custodial role to safeguard Singapore's critical assets and past reserves. As a key institution under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is therefore required to seek the President's approval before a draw occurs on Temasek's past reserves.
Temasek's Chairman and CEO also certify the company's Statement of Reserves and Statement of Past Reserves to the President at prescribed intervals, as part of their responsibility to protect its past reserves.
Portfolio companies[edit]
Temasek is an active investor and rebalances its portfolio from time to time. Decisions to invest, divest, or hold portfolio companies are based on Temasek's intrinsic value test.
Temasek's portfolio companies are guided and managed by their respective Boards and management, which means Temasek does not direct their business decisions or operations.
As Board directors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of their respective companies, Temasek advocates that Boards be independent of management in order to provide effective oversight and supervision of management. This includes having mostly non-executive members on Boards with the strength and experience to oversee management.
Temasek also advocates that the Chairman and CEO roles be held by separate persons, independent of each other, to ensure a balance of power for independent decision-making, and a greater capacity for management supervision by the Board.
Temasek protects its interests by exercising its shareholder rights, including voting at shareholders’ meetings when needed.
Board[edit]
Temasek's Board provides overall guidance and policy directions to its management. As at 31 March 2017, the Board comprises 14 members,[191] the majority of whom are non-executive independent private sector business leaders.
Community engagement[edit]
Since its inception in 1974, Temasek has established 17 endowments focused on building people, building communities, building capabilities and rebuilding lives.
The Temasek Philanthropic Platform was established in 2016 and its establishment restructured Temasek’s 17 philanthropic endowments to six foundations. As of March 2017, these endowments have touched over 500,000 lives across Asia and in Singapore.[192]
Temasek Trust[edit]
Established in 2007, with an initial endowment of S$500 million, Temasek Trust provides financial oversight and governance of Temasek's endowment gifts as an independent trustee.[193]
Temasek Trust is responsible for ensuring disciplined and sustainable disbursements of the endowments and gifts to Temasek's six foundations. The Trust may appoint third party fund managers approved by Temasek.[194]
Temasek Foundation Management Services[edit]
A new entity that was established in 2016 as part of Temasek's restructuring of its philanthropic platforms, Temasek Foundation Management Services serves to drive collaboration among the foundations and provide support services for all of Temasek's foundations.[195]
Temasek Family of Six Foundations[edit]
Under the Temasek Philanthropic Platform, Temasek's Family of Six Foundations includes the following non-profit organisations (NPPOs):
Temasek Foundation International[edit]
Temasek Foundation International, formerly known as Temasek Foundation, is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes that aim to build capabilities with programme partners in and beyond Asia.
These programmes focus on healthcare, education, public administration, urban management and disaster response. Since May 2007, the Foundation has supported 348 programmes in 22 countries across Asia.[196]
Its work is split into the following six programmes:

Since 2009, the Foundation has supported 118 programmes, which have directly benefited more than 38,000 lives.[198]
Temasek Foundation Innovates[edit]
Temasek Foundation Innovates is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and support programmes focusing on developing practical solutions for a better life through research and innovation. Its aims are to strengthen research capabilities by nurturing talents as well as encouraging multi-disciplinary programmes and inter-agency collaboration for collective capabilities.[199]
It oversees two endowments:

The Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, which is a research institute undertaking bio-molecular science research and applications for the benefit of people.[201]

It is part of Temasek’s collective effort, alongside the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, to build an Active Economy, Beautiful Society and Clean Earth.[203]

The Foundation manages the Singapore Summit – an international forum that gathers business and thought leaders, to share perspectives on issues that impact growth, prosperity and stability.[205]
Temasek Foundation Nurtures[edit]
Temasek Foundation Nurtures is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes focused on education and professional development to improve the quality of lives. Its aims are to develop talent and foster learning and growth, particularly for youths to make the leap in areas such as music, arts, sports, math and science, engineering and technology.[206]
Controversy[edit]
Shin Corp[edit]
Temasek is fully owned by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, and these close links to the government have on several occasions caused protests in foreign countries.
Main article: Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings
Temasek's 2006 acquisition of Shin Corporation, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.[207] The deal was a factor in exacerbating the Thai political crisis, which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality. The military junta that overthrew Thaksin, later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.[208] As of 2015, Temasek's stake in Intouch Corporation (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.[209]
Fortune Magazine described the investment in Shin Corp as a "spectacular misjudgment"[210]
Nepotism[edit]
In 2012, Singaporean blog TR Emeritus alleged that the appointment of Ho Ching, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife, as CEO of Temasek Holdings was a case of cronyism and nepotism, which was subsequently deleted and for which they apologised.[210]

Temasek Holdings Private Limited (abbreviated as Temasek) is a state-owned holding company that can be characterized as a national wealth fund owned by the Government of Singapore. Incorporated in 1974, Temasek owns and manages a net portfolio of S$275 billion[5] (as of 31 March 2017), with S$18 billion divested and S$16 billion invested during the year,[6] and 68% exposure to Asia - 29% Singapore and 39% Asia ex-Singapore.[7] It is an active shareholder and investor, and their investments are guided by four key themes - transforming economies, growing middle income populations, deepening comparative advantages and emerging champions. Its portfolio covers a broad spectrum of sectors including financial services, telecommunications, media and technology, transportation and industrials, life sciences and agribusiness, consumer and real estate, energy and resources, as well as multi-sector funds. Temasek has a multinational team of 630 people, in 10 global offices[8] including Singapore, New York, and most recently, San Francisco.[9]
Temasek is commonly referred to as a sovereign wealth fund, particularly by the press and research outlets based outside Singapore.[10] However, it has frequently disputed this terminology, and prefers to be referred to as an investment company, because it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms.[11] However, its sole shareholder (to which it distributes dividends) is Singapore's Ministry of Finance. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance has previously noted that even though "there is still no universally accepted definition of sovereign wealth funds", Temasek is required to abide by international guidelines for sovereign wealth funds.[12] Beginning in 2015, capital gains from Temasek are included in Singapore's government budget, contributing approximately S$3 billion [13] to the 2015 budget.
GIC Private Limited, which is owned by the Government of Singapore, owns Temasek Holdings and manages an estimated US$330 billion, funded by Singapore's foreign reserves. Temasek has credit ratings of “AAA/Aaa” by Standard & Poor's[14] Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service[15] respectively since their inaugural ratings in 2004. Temasek has also attained perfect quarterly scores[16] on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index,[17] a measure of the openness of government-owned investment funds. However, the purported difficulty in measuring transparency of sovereign wealth funds means that the existence of such an index itself is questionable.[18]

History[edit]
Incorporation[edit]
At the point of Singapore's independence in August 1965, the Government of Singapore had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (later split up into Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became Singapore Telecommunications). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's Economic Development Board (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.[19] During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies,[20] such as the Keppel Corporation (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the Royal Navy after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), ST Engineering (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the Singapore Armed Forces), and the shipping company Neptune Orient Lines.
In 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act[21] to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,[22] allowing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to focus on policymaking. Temasek's established mission was to contribute to Singapore's economic development, industrialisation, and financial diversification by nurturing effective and commercially driven strategic investments in and around Singapore.
Status[edit]
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a statutory board. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays taxes that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.
Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule[23] entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.[24] The President also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.
In a 2009 speech,[25] Ho Ching, Temasek's Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance. She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly[26] and independently[27] monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly[28] and accurately[29] disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).
Initial holdings[edit]
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares in the following companies, start-ups and joint ventures previously held by the Singapore Government. The companies included a bird park, a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill. The companies in bold below are still within the Temasek portfolio.

Governance framework[edit]
Temasek Charter[edit]
As an institution, Temasek is guided by the Temasek Charter,[189] a set of principles that guides the company's actions.
The Charter has three main principles:
1. Temasek is an active investor and shareholder.
2. Temasek is a forward looking institution.
3. Temasek is a trusted steward.
According to the first principle, Temasek "owns and manages its assets and makes investment and divestment decisions based on commercial principles with the aim of delivering sustainable value over the long term".
According to the second principle, Temasek is a "forward looking institution with a long term perspective. Through its "MERITT values" (meritocracy, excellence, respect, integrity, teamwork, and trust),[190] Temasek aims to "foster an ownership culture which aligns employee and shareholder interests".
According to the third principle, Temasek acts as "a responsible corporate citizen that safeguards its past reserves and engages people and communities based on the principles of sustainability and good governance".
Rights and obligations[edit]
As an investment company incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act, Temasek owns and manages its assets. This means that it can make business decisions relating to its portfolio with full commercial discretion under the guidance of its Board, such as increasing, holding, or decreasing its investment holdings to achieve maximum risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
Under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is one of the key Singapore entities with constitutional safeguards to protect its past reserves.
Key companies designated under the Singapore Constitution include the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, which manages the reserves of the Singapore Government. Other designated entities with constitutional safeguards for their respective past reserves under the Singapore Constitution are statutory Boards such as the Central Provident Fund Board and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Owner and shareholder[edit]
Guided by business tenets, Temasek operates with full flexibility without the involvement of its shareholders, Singapore's Ministry of Finance and the President of Singapore.
Temasek is wholly owned by the Minister for Finance, who under the Singapore Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act (Chapter 183) is a body corporate.
As such, Temasek provides annual statutory financial statements audited by an international audit firm, as well as periodic updates to its shareholder.
Temasek is a Singapore exempt private company exempted from disclosing any financial information publicly, but chooses to publish its Group Financial Summary and portfolio performance in its annual report, the Temasek Review.
Temasek also declares dividends annually, once they are deliberated and recommended by its Board for its shareholder's consideration at the annual general meeting. Temasek contributes to the Singapore Government budget via the dividends it pays to its shareholder and the tax on its profits.
The shareholder's right to appoint, reappoint, or remove Board members is subject to the President's approval, a measure put in place to safeguard the integrity of the Board and to protect the company's past reserves.
The appointment or removal of the CEO by the Board is also subject to the concurrence of the President.
Further to its normal fiduciary duties to the Company, the Board is also accountable to the President to ensure that every disposal of investment is transacted at fair market value.
Protection of Temasek's past reserves[edit]







According to the Singapore Constitution, Temasek's past reserves are those accumulated before the current term of Government while its current reserves are those accumulated during the current term of Government.
This means that on the eve of the first day of each term of Government, Temasek's total reserves – comprising past reserves and current reserves as at the changeover – are locked up as past reserves for the next term of Government. This cycle repeats every time there is a change in the term of Government.
The President of the Republic of Singapore has an independent custodial role to safeguard Singapore's critical assets and past reserves. As a key institution under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is therefore required to seek the President's approval before a draw occurs on Temasek's past reserves.
Temasek's Chairman and CEO also certify the company's Statement of Reserves and Statement of Past Reserves to the President at prescribed intervals, as part of their responsibility to protect its past reserves.
Portfolio companies[edit]
Temasek is an active investor and rebalances its portfolio from time to time. Decisions to invest, divest, or hold portfolio companies are based on Temasek's intrinsic value test.
Temasek's portfolio companies are guided and managed by their respective Boards and management, which means Temasek does not direct their business decisions or operations.
As Board directors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of their respective companies, Temasek advocates that Boards be independent of management in order to provide effective oversight and supervision of management. This includes having mostly non-executive members on Boards with the strength and experience to oversee management.
Temasek also advocates that the Chairman and CEO roles be held by separate persons, independent of each other, to ensure a balance of power for independent decision-making, and a greater capacity for management supervision by the Board.
Temasek protects its interests by exercising its shareholder rights, including voting at shareholders’ meetings when needed.
Board[edit]
Temasek's Board provides overall guidance and policy directions to its management. As at 31 March 2017, the Board comprises 14 members,[191] the majority of whom are non-executive independent private sector business leaders.
Community engagement[edit]
Since its inception in 1974, Temasek has established 17 endowments focused on building people, building communities, building capabilities and rebuilding lives.
The Temasek Philanthropic Platform was established in 2016 and its establishment restructured Temasek’s 17 philanthropic endowments to six foundations. As of March 2017, these endowments have touched over 500,000 lives across Asia and in Singapore.[192]
Temasek Trust[edit]
Established in 2007, with an initial endowment of S$500 million, Temasek Trust provides financial oversight and governance of Temasek's endowment gifts as an independent trustee.[193]
Temasek Trust is responsible for ensuring disciplined and sustainable disbursements of the endowments and gifts to Temasek's six foundations. The Trust may appoint third party fund managers approved by Temasek.[194]
Temasek Foundation Management Services[edit]
A new entity that was established in 2016 as part of Temasek's restructuring of its philanthropic platforms, Temasek Foundation Management Services serves to drive collaboration among the foundations and provide support services for all of Temasek's foundations.[195]
Temasek Family of Six Foundations[edit]

Its aims are to develop talent and foster learning and growth, particularly for youths to make the leap in areas such as music, arts, sports, math and science, engineering and technology.[206]
Controversy[edit]
Shin Corp[edit]
Temasek is fully owned by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, and these close links to the government have on several occasions caused protests in foreign countries.
Main article: Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings
Temasek's 2006 acquisition of Shin Corporation, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.[207] The deal was a factor in exacerbating the Thai political crisis, which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality. The military junta that overthrew Thaksin, later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.[208] As of 2015, Temasek's stake in Intouch Corporation (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.[209]
Fortune Magazine described the investment in Shin Corp as a "spectacular misjudgment"[210]
Nepotism[edit]
In 2012, Singaporean blog TR Emeritus alleged that the appointment of Ho Ching, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife, as CEO of Temasek Holdings was a case of cronyism and nepotism, which was subsequently deleted and for which they apologised.[210]

Temasek Holdings Private Limited (abbreviated as Temasek) is a state-owned holding company that can be characterized as a national wealth fund owned by the Government of Singapore. Incorporated in 1974, Temasek owns and manages a net portfolio of S$275 billion[5] (as of 31 March 2017), with S$18 billion divested and S$16 billion invested during the year,[6] and 68% exposure to Asia - 29% Singapore and 39% Asia ex-Singapore.[7] It is an active shareholder and investor, and their investments are guided by four key themes - transforming economies, growing middle income populations, deepening comparative advantages and emerging champions. Its portfolio covers a broad spectrum of sectors including financial services, telecommunications, media and technology, transportation and industrials, life sciences and agribusiness, consumer and real estate, energy and resources, as well as multi-sector funds. Temasek has a multinational team of 630 people, in 10 global offices[8] including Singapore, New York, and most recently, San Francisco.[9]
Temasek is commonly referred to as a sovereign wealth fund, particularly by the press and research outlets based outside Singapore.[10] However, it has frequently disputed this terminology, and prefers to be referred to as an investment company, because it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms.[11] However, its sole shareholder (to which it distributes dividends) is Singapore's Ministry of Finance. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance has previously noted that even though "there is still no universally accepted definition of sovereign wealth funds", Temasek is required to abide by international guidelines for sovereign wealth funds.[12] Beginning in 2015, capital gains from Temasek are included in Singapore's government budget, contributing approximately S$3 billion [13] to the 2015 budget.
GIC Private Limited, which is owned by the Government of Singapore, owns Temasek Holdings and manages an estimated US$330 billion, funded by Singapore's foreign reserves. Temasek has credit ratings of “AAA/Aaa” by Standard & Poor's[14] Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service[15] respectively since their inaugural ratings in 2004. Temasek has also attained perfect quarterly scores[16] on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index,[17] a measure of the openness of government-owned investment funds. However, the purported difficulty in measuring transparency of sovereign wealth funds means that the existence of such an index itself is questionable.[18]

History[edit]
Incorporation[edit]
At the point of Singapore's independence in August 1965, the Government of Singapore had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (later split up into Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became Singapore Telecommunications). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's Economic Development Board (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.[19] During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies,[20] such as the Keppel Corporation (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the Royal Navy after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), ST Engineering (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the Singapore Armed Forces), and the shipping company Neptune Orient Lines.
In 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act[21] to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,[22] allowing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to focus on policymaking. Temasek's established mission was to contribute to Singapore's economic development, industrialisation, and financial diversification by nurturing effective and commercially driven strategic investments in and around Singapore.
Status[edit]
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a statutory board. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays taxes that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.
Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule[23] entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.[24] The President also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.
In a 2009 speech,[25] Ho Ching, Temasek's Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance. She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly[26] and independently[27] monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly[28] and accurately[29] disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).
Initial holdings[edit]
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares in the following companies, start-ups and joint ventures previously held by the Singapore Government. The companies included a bird park, a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill. The companies in bold below are still within the Temasek portfolio.

Governance framework[edit]
Temasek Charter[edit]
As an institution, Temasek is guided by the Temasek Charter,[189] a set of principles that guides the company's actions.
The Charter has three main principles:
1. Temasek is an active investor and shareholder.
2. Temasek is a forward looking institution.
3. Temasek is a trusted steward.
According to the first principle, Temasek "owns and manages its assets and makes investment and divestment decisions based on commercial principles with the aim of delivering sustainable value over the long term".
According to the second principle, Temasek is a "forward looking institution with a long term perspective. Through its "MERITT values" (meritocracy, excellence, respect, integrity, teamwork, and trust),[190] Temasek aims to "foster an ownership culture which aligns employee and shareholder interests".
According to the third principle, Temasek acts as "a responsible corporate citizen that safeguards its past reserves and engages people and communities based on the principles of sustainability and good governance".
Rights and obligations[edit]
As an investment company incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act, Temasek owns and manages its assets. This means that it can make business decisions relating to its portfolio with full commercial discretion under the guidance of its Board, such as increasing, holding, or decreasing its investment holdings to achieve maximum risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
Under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is one of the key Singapore entities with constitutional safeguards to protect its past reserves.
Key companies designated under the Singapore Constitution include the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, which manages the reserves of the Singapore Government. Other designated entities with constitutional safeguards for their respective past reserves under the Singapore Constitution are statutory Boards such as the Central Provident Fund Board and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Owner and shareholder[edit]
Guided by business tenets, Temasek operates with full flexibility without the involvement of its shareholders, Singapore's Ministry of Finance and the President of Singapore.
Temasek is wholly owned by the Minister for Finance, who under the Singapore Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act (Chapter 183) is a body corporate.
As such, Temasek provides annual statutory financial statements audited by an international audit firm, as well as periodic updates to its shareholder.
Temasek is a Singapore exempt private company exempted from disclosing any financial information publicly, but chooses to publish its Group Financial Summary and portfolio performance in its annual report, the Temasek Review.
Temasek also declares dividends annually, once they are deliberated and recommended by its Board for its shareholder's consideration at the annual general meeting. Temasek contributes to the Singapore Government budget via the dividends it pays to its shareholder and the tax on its profits.
The shareholder's right to appoint, reappoint, or remove Board members is subject to the President's approval, a measure put in place to safeguard the integrity of the Board and to protect the company's past reserves.
The appointment or removal of the CEO by the Board is also subject to the concurrence of the President.
Further to its normal fiduciary duties to the Company, the Board is also accountable to the President to ensure that every disposal of investment is transacted at fair market value.
Protection of Temasek's past reserves[edit]







According to the Singapore Constitution, Temasek's past reserves are those accumulated before the current term of Government while its current reserves are those accumulated during the current term of Government.
This means that on the eve of the first day of each term of Government, Temasek's total reserves – comprising past reserves and current reserves as at the changeover – are locked up as past reserves for the next term of Government. This cycle repeats every time there is a change in the term of Government.
The President of the Republic of Singapore has an independent custodial role to safeguard Singapore's critical assets and past reserves. As a key institution under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is therefore required to seek the President's approval before a draw occurs on Temasek's past reserves.
Temasek's Chairman and CEO also certify the company's Statement of Reserves and Statement of Past Reserves to the President at prescribed intervals, as part of their responsibility to protect its past reserves.
Portfolio companies[edit]
Temasek is an active investor and rebalances its portfolio from time to time. Decisions to invest, divest, or hold portfolio companies are based on Temasek's intrinsic value test.
Temasek's portfolio companies are guided and managed by their respective Boards and management, which means Temasek does not direct their business decisions or operations.
As Board directors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of their respective companies, Temasek advocates that Boards be independent of management in order to provide effective oversight and supervision of management. This includes having mostly non-executive members on Boards with the strength and experience to oversee management.
Temasek also advocates that the Chairman and CEO roles be held by separate persons, independent of each other, to ensure a balance of power for independent decision-making, and a greater capacity for management supervision by the Board.
Temasek protects its interests by exercising its shareholder rights, including voting at shareholders’ meetings when needed.
Board[edit]
Temasek's Board provides overall guidance and policy directions to its management. As at 31 March 2017, the Board comprises 14 members,[191] the majority of whom are non-executive independent private sector business leaders.
Community engagement[edit]
Since its inception in 1974, Temasek has established 17 endowments focused on building people, building communities, building capabilities and rebuilding lives.
The Temasek Philanthropic Platform was established in 2016 and its establishment restructured Temasek’s 17 philanthropic endowments to six foundations. As of March 2017, these endowments have touched over 500,000 lives across Asia and in Singapore.[192]
Temasek Trust[edit]
Established in 2007, with an initial endowment of S$500 million, Temasek Trust provides financial oversight and governance of Temasek's endowment gifts as an independent trustee.[193]
Temasek Trust is responsible for ensuring disciplined and sustainable disbursements of the endowments and gifts to Temasek's six foundations. The Trust may appoint third party fund managers approved by Temasek.[194]
Temasek Foundation Management Services[edit]
A new entity that was established in 2016 as part of Temasek's restructuring of its philanthropic platforms, Temasek Foundation Management Services serves to drive collaboration among the foundations and provide support services for all of Temasek's foundations.[195]
Temasek Family of Six Foundations[edit]
Under the Temasek Philanthropic Platform, Temasek's Family of Six Foundations includes the following non-profit organisations (NPPOs):
Temasek Foundation International[edit]
Temasek Foundation International, formerly known as Temasek Foundation, is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes that aim to build capabilities with programme partners in and beyond Asia.
These programmes focus on healthcare, education, public administration, urban management and disaster response. Since May 2007, the Foundation has supported 348 programmes in 22 countries across Asia.[196]
Its work is split into the following six programmes:

Building People in Health Care

Singapore Technologies Endowment Programme (STEP)

Temasek Foundation Cares[edit]
Temasek Foundation Cares is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports meaningful and innovative community-based programmes for the benefit of Singaporeans. 
It aims to contribute to the well-being, dignity, and livelihood of underprivileged individuals, families and communities in Singapore. They include the elderly, those needing palliative care and people with special needs.[197]
Since 2009, the Foundation has supported 118 programmes, which have directly benefited more than 38,000 lives.[198]
Temasek Foundation Innovates[edit]
Temasek Foundation Innovates is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and support programmes focusing on developing practical solutions for a better life through research and innovation. Its aims are to strengthen research capabilities by nurturing talents as well as encouraging multi-disciplinary programmes and inter-agency collaboration for collective capabilities.[199]
It oversees two endowments:

The Singapore Millennium Foundation, which promotes research through the awarding of post graduate research scholarships and funding of research programmes.[200]
The Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, which is a research institute undertaking bio-molecular science research and applications for the benefit of people.[201]

Temasek Foundation Ecosperity[edit]

It is part of Temasek’s collective effort, alongside the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, to build an Active Economy, Beautiful Society and Clean Earth.[203]
Temasek Foundation Connects[edit]
Temasek Foundation Connects is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes, which seek to build bridges and partnerships and promote dialogue and mutual understanding across international communities and markets.[204]
The Foundation manages the Singapore Summit – an international forum that gathers business and thought leaders, to share perspectives on issues that impact growth, prosperity and stability.[205]
Temasek Foundation Nurtures[edit]
Temasek Foundation Nurtures is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes focused on education and professional development to improve the quality of lives. Its aims are to develop talent and foster learning and growth, particularly for youths to make the leap in areas such as music, arts, sports, math and science, engineering and technology.[206]
Controversy[edit]
Shin Corp[edit]
Temasek is fully owned by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, and these close links to the government have on several occasions caused protests in foreign countries.
Main article: Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings
Temasek's 2006 acquisition of Shin Corporation, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.[207] The deal was a factor in exacerbating the Thai political crisis, which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality. The military junta that overthrew Thaksin, later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.[208] As of 2015, Temasek's stake in Intouch Corporation (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.[209]
Fortune Magazine described the investment in Shin Corp as a "spectacular misjudgment"[210]
Nepotism[edit]
In 2012, Singaporean blog TR Emeritus alleged that the appointment of Ho Ching, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife, as CEO of Temasek Holdings was a case of cronyism and nepotism, which was subsequently deleted and for which they apologised.[210]

Temasek Holdings Private Limited (abbreviated as Temasek) is a state-owned holding company that can be characterized as a national wealth fund owned by the Government of Singapore. Incorporated in 1974, Temasek owns and manages a net portfolio of S$275 billion[5] (as of 31 March 2017), with S$18 billion divested and S$16 billion invested during the year,[6] and 68% exposure to Asia - 29% Singapore and 39% Asia ex-Singapore.[7] It is an active shareholder and investor, and their investments are guided by four key themes - transforming economies, growing middle income populations, deepening comparative advantages and emerging champions. Its portfolio covers a broad spectrum of sectors including financial services, telecommunications, media and technology, transportation and industrials, life sciences and agribusiness, consumer and real estate, energy and resources, as well as multi-sector funds. Temasek has a multinational team of 630 people, in 10 global offices[8] including Singapore, New York, and most recently, San Francisco.[9]
Temasek is commonly referred to as a sovereign wealth fund, particularly by the press and research outlets based outside Singapore.[10] However, it has frequently disputed this terminology, and prefers to be referred to as an investment company, because it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms.[11] However, its sole shareholder (to which it distributes dividends) is Singapore's Ministry of Finance. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance has previously noted that even though "there is still no universally accepted definition of sovereign wealth funds", Temasek is required to abide by international guidelines for sovereign wealth funds.[12] Beginning in 2015, capital gains from Temasek are included in Singapore's government budget, contributing approximately S$3 billion [13] to the 2015 budget.
GIC Private Limited, which is owned by the Government of Singapore, owns Temasek Holdings and manages an estimated US$330 billion, funded by Singapore's foreign reserves. Temasek has credit ratings of “AAA/Aaa” by Standard & Poor's[14] Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service[15] respectively since their inaugural ratings in 2004. Temasek has also attained perfect quarterly scores[16] on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index,[17] a measure of the openness of government-owned investment funds. However, the purported difficulty in measuring transparency of sovereign wealth funds means that the existence of such an index itself is questionable.[18]

History[edit]
Incorporation[edit]
At the point of Singapore's independence in August 1965, the Government of Singapore had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (later split up into Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became Singapore Telecommunications). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's Economic Development Board (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.[19] During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies,[20] such as the Keppel Corporation (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the Royal Navy after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), ST Engineering (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the Singapore Armed Forces), and the shipping company Neptune Orient Lines.
In 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act[21] to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,[22] allowing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to focus on policymaking. Temasek's established mission was to contribute to Singapore's economic development, industrialisation, and financial diversification by nurturing effective and commercially driven strategic investments in and around Singapore.
Status[edit]
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a statutory board. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays taxes that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.
Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule[23] entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.[24] The President also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.
In a 2009 speech,[25] Ho Ching, Temasek's Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance. She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly[26] and independently[27] monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly[28] and accurately[29] disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).
Initial holdings[edit]
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares in the following companies, start-ups and joint ventures previously held by the Singapore Government. The companies included a bird park, a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill. The companies in bold below are still within the Temasek portfolio.

Governance framework[edit]
Temasek Charter[edit]
As an institution, Temasek is guided by the Temasek Charter,[189] a set of principles that guides the company's actions.
The Charter has three main principles:
1. Temasek is an active investor and shareholder.
2. Temasek is a forward looking institution.
3. Temasek is a trusted steward.
According to the first principle, Temasek "owns and manages its assets and makes investment and divestment decisions based on commercial principles with the aim of delivering sustainable value over the long term".
According to the second principle, Temasek is a "forward looking institution with a long term perspective. Through its "MERITT values" (meritocracy, excellence, respect, integrity, teamwork, and trust),[190] Temasek aims to "foster an ownership culture which aligns employee and shareholder interests".
According to the third principle, Temasek acts as "a responsible corporate citizen that safeguards its past reserves and engages people and communities based on the principles of sustainability and good governance".
Rights and obligations[edit]
As an investment company incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act, Temasek owns and manages its assets. This means that it can make business decisions relating to its portfolio with full commercial discretion under the guidance of its Board, such as increasing, holding, or decreasing its investment holdings to achieve maximum risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
Under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is one of the key Singapore entities with constitutional safeguards to protect its past reserves.
Key companies designated under the Singapore Constitution include the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, which manages the reserves of the Singapore Government. Other designated entities with constitutional safeguards for their respective past reserves under the Singapore Constitution are statutory Boards such as the Central Provident Fund Board and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Owner and shareholder[edit]
Guided by business tenets, Temasek operates with full flexibility without the involvement of its shareholders, Singapore's Ministry of Finance and the President of Singapore.
Temasek is wholly owned by the Minister for Finance, who under the Singapore Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act (Chapter 183) is a body corporate.
As such, Temasek provides annual statutory financial statements audited by an international audit firm, as well as periodic updates to its shareholder.
Temasek is a Singapore exempt private company exempted from disclosing any financial information publicly, but chooses to publish its Group Financial Summary and portfolio performance in its annual report, the Temasek Review.
Temasek also declares dividends annually, once they are deliberated and recommended by its Board for its shareholder's consideration at the annual general meeting. Temasek contributes to the Singapore Government budget via the dividends it pays to its shareholder and the tax on its profits.
The shareholder's right to appoint, reappoint, or remove Board members is subject to the President's approval, a measure put in place to safeguard the integrity of the Board and to protect the company's past reserves.
The appointment or removal of the CEO by the Board is also subject to the concurrence of the President.
Further to its normal fiduciary duties to the Company, the Board is also accountable to the President to ensure that every disposal of investment is transacted at fair market value.
Protection of Temasek's past reserves[edit]







According to the Singapore Constitution, Temasek's past reserves are those accumulated before the current term of Government while its current reserves are those accumulated during the current term of Government.
This means that on the eve of the first day of each term of Government, Temasek's total reserves – comprising past reserves and current reserves as at the changeover – are locked up as past reserves for the next term of Government. This cycle repeats every time there is a change in the term of Government.
The President of the Republic of Singapore has an independent custodial role to safeguard Singapore's critical assets and past reserves. As a key institution under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is therefore required to seek the President's approval before a draw occurs on Temasek's past reserves.
Temasek's Chairman and CEO also certify the company's Statement of Reserves and Statement of Past Reserves to the President at prescribed intervals, as part of their responsibility to protect its past reserves.
Portfolio companies[edit]
Temasek is an active investor and rebalances its portfolio from time to time. Decisions to invest, divest, or hold portfolio companies are based on Temasek's intrinsic value test.
Temasek's portfolio companies are guided and managed by their respective Boards and management, which means Temasek does not direct their business decisions or operations.
As Board directors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of their respective companies, Temasek advocates that Boards be independent of management in order to provide effective oversight and supervision of management. This includes having mostly non-executive members on Boards with the strength and experience to oversee management.
Temasek also advocates that the Chairman and CEO roles be held by separate persons, independent of each other, to ensure a balance of power for independent decision-making, and a greater capacity for management supervision by the Board.
Temasek protects its interests by exercising its shareholder rights, including voting at shareholders’ meetings when needed.
Board[edit]
Temasek's Board provides overall guidance and policy directions to its management. As at 31 March 2017, the Board comprises 14 members,[191] the majority of whom are non-executive independent private sector business leaders.
Community engagement[edit]
Since its inception in 1974, Temasek has established 17 endowments focused on building people, building communities, building capabilities and rebuilding lives.
The Temasek Philanthropic Platform was established in 2016 and its establishment restructured Temasek’s 17 philanthropic endowments to six foundations. As of March 2017, these endowments have touched over 500,000 lives across Asia and in Singapore.[192]
Temasek Trust[edit]
Established in 2007, with an initial endowment of S$500 million, Temasek Trust provides financial oversight and governance of Temasek's endowment gifts as an independent trustee.[193]
Temasek Trust is responsible for ensuring disciplined and sustainable disbursements of the endowments and gifts to Temasek's six foundations. The Trust may appoint third party fund managers approved by Temasek.[194]
Temasek Foundation Management Services[edit]
A new entity that was established in 2016 as part of Temasek's restructuring of its philanthropic platforms, Temasek Foundation Management Services serves to drive collaboration among the foundations and provide support services for all of Temasek's foundations.[195]
Temasek Family of Six Foundations[edit]
Under the Temasek Philanthropic Platform, Temasek's Family of Six Foundations includes the following non-profit organisations (NPPOs):
Temasek Foundation International[edit]
Temasek Foundation International, formerly known as Temasek Foundation, is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes that aim to build capabilities with programme partners in and beyond Asia.

Its work is split into the following six programmes:

Temasek Foundation Nurtures[edit]
Temasek Foundation Nurtures is a Singapore-based NPPO that funds and supports programmes focused on education and professional development to improve the quality of lives. Its aims are to develop talent and foster learning and growth, particularly for youths to make the leap in areas such as music, arts, sports, math and science, engineering and technology.[206]
Controversy[edit]
Shin Corp[edit]
Temasek is fully owned by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, and these close links to the government have on several occasions caused protests in foreign countries.
Main article: Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings
Temasek's 2006 acquisition of Shin Corporation, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.[207] The deal was a factor in exacerbating the Thai political crisis, which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality. The military junta that overthrew Thaksin, later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.[208] As of 2015, Temasek's stake in Intouch Corporation (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.[209]
Fortune Magazine described the investment in Shin Corp as a "spectacular misjudgment"[210]
Nepotism[edit]
In 2012, Singaporean blog TR Emeritus alleged that the appointment of Ho Ching, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife, as CEO of Temasek Holdings was a case of cronyism and nepotism, which was subsequently deleted and for which they apologised.[210]

Temasek Holdings Private Limited (abbreviated as Temasek) is a state-owned holding company that can be characterized as a national wealth fund owned by the Government of Singapore. Incorporated in 1974, Temasek owns and manages a net portfolio of S$275 billion[5] (as of 31 March 2017), with S$18 billion divested and S$16 billion invested during the year,[6] and 68% exposure to Asia - 29% Singapore and 39% Asia ex-Singapore.[7] It is an active shareholder and investor, and their investments are guided by four key themes - transforming economies, growing middle income populations, deepening comparative advantages and emerging champions. Its portfolio covers a broad spectrum of sectors including financial services, telecommunications, media and technology, transportation and industrials, life sciences and agribusiness, consumer and real estate, energy and resources, as well as multi-sector funds. Temasek has a multinational team of 630 people, in 10 global offices[8] including Singapore, New York, and most recently, San Francisco.[9]
Temasek is commonly referred to as a sovereign wealth fund, particularly by the press and research outlets based outside Singapore.[10] However, it has frequently disputed this terminology, and prefers to be referred to as an investment company, because it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets, and pays taxes like other commercial investment firms.[11] However, its sole shareholder (to which it distributes dividends) is Singapore's Ministry of Finance. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance has previously noted that even though "there is still no universally accepted definition of sovereign wealth funds", Temasek is required to abide by international guidelines for sovereign wealth funds.[12] Beginning in 2015, capital gains from Temasek are included in Singapore's government budget, contributing approximately S$3 billion [13] to the 2015 budget.
GIC Private Limited, which is owned by the Government of Singapore, owns Temasek Holdings and manages an estimated US$330 billion, funded by Singapore's foreign reserves. Temasek has credit ratings of “AAA/Aaa” by Standard & Poor's[14] Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service[15] respectively since their inaugural ratings in 2004. Temasek has also attained perfect quarterly scores[16] on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index,[17] a measure of the openness of government-owned investment funds. However, the purported difficulty in measuring transparency of sovereign wealth funds means that the existence of such an index itself is questionable.[18]

History[edit]
Incorporation[edit]
At the point of Singapore's independence in August 1965, the Government of Singapore had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (later split up into Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became Singapore Telecommunications). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's Economic Development Board (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.[19] During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies,[20] such as the Keppel Corporation (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the Royal Navy after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), ST Engineering (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the Singapore Armed Forces), and the shipping company Neptune Orient Lines.
In 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act[21] to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,[22] allowing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to focus on policymaking. Temasek's established mission was to contribute to Singapore's economic development, industrialisation, and financial diversification by nurturing effective and commercially driven strategic investments in and around Singapore.
Status[edit]
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a statutory board. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays taxes that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.
Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule[23] entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.[24] The President also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.
In a 2009 speech,[25] Ho Ching, Temasek's Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance. She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly[26] and independently[27] monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly[28] and accurately[29] disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).
Initial holdings[edit]
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares in the following companies, start-ups and joint ventures previously held by the Singapore Government. The companies included a bird park, a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill. The companies in bold below are still within the Temasek portfolio.

Governance framework[edit]
Temasek Charter[edit]
As an institution, Temasek is guided by the Temasek Charter,[189] a set of principles that guides the company's actions.
The Charter has three main principles:
1. Temasek is an active investor and shareholder.
2. Temasek is a forward looking institution.
3. Temasek is a trusted steward.
According to the first principle, Temasek "owns and manages its assets and makes investment and divestment decisions based on commercial principles with the aim of delivering sustainable value over the long term".
According to the second principle, Temasek is a "forward looking institution with a long term perspective. Through its "MERITT values" (meritocracy, excellence, respect, integrity, teamwork, and trust),[190] Temasek aims to "foster an ownership culture which aligns employee and shareholder interests".
According to the third principle, Temasek acts as "a responsible corporate citizen that safeguards its past reserves and engages people and communities based on the principles of sustainability and good governance".
Rights and obligations[edit]
As an investment company incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act, Temasek owns and manages its assets. This means that it can make business decisions relating to its portfolio with full commercial discretion under the guidance of its Board, such as increasing, holding, or decreasing its investment holdings to achieve maximum risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
Under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is one of the key Singapore entities with constitutional safeguards to protect its past reserves.
Key companies designated under the Singapore Constitution include the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, which manages the reserves of the Singapore Government. Other designated entities with constitutional safeguards for their respective past reserves under the Singapore Constitution are statutory Boards such as the Central Provident Fund Board and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Owner and shareholder[edit]
Guided by business tenets, Temasek operates with full flexibility without the involvement of its shareholders, Singapore's Ministry of Finance and the President of Singapore.
Temasek is wholly owned by the Minister for Finance, who under the Singapore Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act (Chapter 183) is a body corporate.
As such, Temasek provides annual statutory financial statements audited by an international audit firm, as well as periodic updates to its shareholder.
Temasek is a Singapore exempt private company exempted from disclosing any financial information publicly, but chooses to publish its Group Financial Summary and portfolio performance in its annual report, the Temasek Review.
Temasek also declares dividends annually, once they are deliberated and recommended by its Board for its shareholder's consideration at the annual general meeting. Temasek contributes to the Singapore Government budget via the dividends it pays to its shareholder and the tax on its profits.
The shareholder's right to appoint, reappoint, or remove Board members is subject to the President's approval, a measure put in place to safeguard the integrity of the Board and to protect the company's past reserves.
The appointment or removal of the CEO by the Board is also subject to the concurrence of the President.
Further to its normal fiduciary duties to the Company, the Board is also accountable to the President to ensure that every disposal of investment is transacted at fair market value.
Protection of Temasek's past reserves[edit]







According to the Singapore Constitution, Temasek's past reserves are those accumulated before the current term of Government while its current reserves are those accumulated during the current term of Government.
This means that on the eve of the first day of each term of Government, Temasek's total reserves – comprising past reserves and current reserves as at the changeover – are locked up as past reserves for the next term of Government. This cycle repeats every time there is a change in the term of Government.
The President of the Republic of Singapore has an independent custodial role to safeguard Singapore's critical assets and past reserves. As a key institution under the Singapore Constitution, Temasek is therefore required to seek the President's approval before a draw occurs on Temasek's past reserves.
Temasek's Chairman and CEO also certify the company's Statement of Reserves and Statement of Past Reserves to the President at prescribed intervals, as part of their responsibility to protect its past reserves.
Portfolio companies[edit]
Temasek is an active investor and rebalances its portfolio from time to time. Decisions to invest, divest, or hold portfolio companies are based on Temasek's intrinsic value test.
Temasek's portfolio companies are guided and managed by their respective Boards and management, which means Temasek does not direct their business decisions or operations.
As Board directors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of their respective companies, Temasek advocates that Boards be independent of management in order to provide effective oversight and supervision of management. This includes having mostly non-executive members on Boards with the strength and experience to oversee management.
Temasek also advocates that the Chairman and CEO roles be held by separate persons, independent of each other, to ensure a balance of power for independent decision-making, and a greater capacity for management supervision by the Board.
Temasek protects its interests by exercising its shareholder rights, including voting at shareholders’ meetings when needed.
Board[edit]
Temasek's Board provides overall guidance and policy directions to its management. As at 31 March 2017, the Board comprises 14 members,[191] the majority of whom are non-executive independent private sector business leaders.
Community engagement[edit]
Since its inception in 1974, Temasek has established 17 endowments focused on building people, building communities, building capabilities and rebuilding lives.
The Temasek Philanthropic Platform was established in 2016 and its establishment restructured Temasek’s 17 philanthropic endowments to six foundations. As of March 2017, these endowments have touched over 500,000 lives across Asia and in Singapore.[192]
Temasek Trust[edit]
Established in 2007, with an initial endowment of S$500 million, Temasek Trust provides financial oversight and governance of Temasek's endowment gifts as an independent trustee.[193]
Temasek Trust is responsible for ensuring disciplined and sustainable disbursements of the endowments and gifts to Temasek's six foundations. The Trust may appoint third party fund managers approved by Temasek.[194]
Temasek Foundation Management Services[edit]
A new entity that was established in 2016 as part of Temasek's restructuring of its philanthropic platforms, Temasek Foundation Management Services serves to drive collaboration among the foundations and provide support services for all of Temasek's foundations.[195]

Controversy[edit]
Shin Corp[edit]
Temasek is fully owned by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, and these close links to the government have on several occasions caused protests in foreign countries.
Main article: Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings
Temasek's 2006 acquisition of Shin Corporation, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.[207] The deal was a factor in exacerbating the Thai political crisis, which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality. The military junta that overthrew Thaksin, later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.[208] As of 2015, Temasek's stake in Intouch Corporation (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.[209]
Fortune Magazine described the investment in Shin Corp as a "spectacular misjudgment"[210]
Nepotism[edit]
In 2012, Singaporean blog TR Emeritus alleged that the appointment of Ho Ching, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife, as CEO of Temasek Holdings was a case of cronyism and nepotism, which was subsequently deleted and for which they apologised.[210]

Temasek Capital Management Pte Ltd Key Developments

CIC Is Reported To Buy Blackstone’s Logicor
May 29 17
China Investment Corporation (CIC) is in pole position to buy Logicor Europe Ltd. from The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX), in a deal that would value Logicor at more than €12 billion. CIC has moved ahead of rivals for Logicor, Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd., Temasek Capital Management Pte Ltd and Global Logistic Properties Limited (SGX:MC0). Blackstone and advisor Eastdil Secured have been pushing the sales process ahead aggressively over the past few weeks building strong competitive tension with formal bids submitted on May 25, 2017. Temasek and Mapletree are still interested in Logicor and are willing and able to undertake the transaction should a deal with CIC falter. GLP submitted a bid for Logicor but uncertainty over its own corporate future is understood to have hampered its ambitions. Cushman & Wakefield and KPMG are advising CIC. JLL and EY are advising Mapletree and Temasek. CBRE is advising GLP. Eastdil Secured is advising Blackstone on the trade sale; Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi and Morgan Stanley were advising on the prospective IPO while PwC and Deloitte have also been involved in administering the disposal.


Investors Reportedly Circle Mumbai Airport
Nov 4 16
TPG Capital, L.P. is competing with Temasek Capital Management Pte Ltd, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (TSX:FFH) to acquire as much as 49% of Mumbai International Airport Limited from GVK Airport Holdings Private Limited. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are running a formal process to help GVK find an investor, sources said. “A process is on. The negotiations are to find an investor to a specific operational asset — something that we have done in Bangalore. We hope to conclude it as soon as possible, perhaps in this calendar year itself,” a person close to GVK said.


Yum Brands Puts Yum Brands China For Sale
Jul 27 16
Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is seeking to sell Yum! China Holding, Inc. However, according the Financial Times cited sources, Yum Brands is seems to be unsatisfied by the offer price from two main potential buyers, being Primavera Capital Group and Temasek Capital Management Pte Ltd. These two have offered to buy at least a part of the fast food asset from Yum! Brands China.

Investment Themes




	Temasek’s decisions as a professionally managed investment house are guided by business tenets and commercial discipline.

	As the owner of our portfolio, we have the flexibility to take concentrated positions with a long or short time horizon, and invest, divest or remain liquid when it makes sense.

	Our investment philosophy has remained largely unchanged over the last 15 years. We are committed to our roles as an investor and owner of our portfolio, seeking to deliver sustainable returns over the long term.

	Temasek’s investment strategy continues to be guided by these four investment themes, and the long term trends they represent:


Transforming Economies
		- Tapping the potential of transforming economies like China, India, South East Asia and Latin America, through investments in sectors such as financial services, infrastructure and logistics.



Growing Middle Income Populations
		- Leveraging growing consumer demands through investments in sectors such as telecommunications, media and technology, and consumer and real estate.



Deepening Comparative Advantages 

- Seeking out economies, businesses and companies with distinctive intellectual property and other competitive advantages.




Emerging Champions
		- Investing in companies with a strong home base, as well as companies at inflection points, with the potential to be regional or global champions.
