NeuroOne Inc, a developer of advanced neuromonitoring and neuromodulating products, has secured $1.2 million in seed funding. The investors included FundRx Inc.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, NY – March 14, 2017 – FundRx Inc., an early stage healthcare venture capital firm, today announced that it has invested in NeuroOne Inc., a next generation, platform technology company focused on developing advanced neuromonitoring and neuromodulating products. FundRx participated in a $1.2 million seed round which will be used to accelerate NeuroOne’s lead product, a neurodiagnostic solution for the treatment of epilepsy.
NeuroOne’s core technology was developed in partnership with the Mayo Clinic and the University of Wisconsin.
“NeuroOne’s technology platform will add significant value both for payors and patients specifically in the way we manage treatments for epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurological disorders. This is an example where innovation in other fields, such as semiconductors, have a direct impact on improving healthcare once the human science catches up,” said Zeshan Muhammedi, CEO at FundRx.
FundRx’s network of neurologists, neurosurgeons and diagnostic experts evaluated NeuroOne through its Peer Review Council process. This Council is an integral part of the FundRx diligence process as it helps evaluate a company’s core scientific merits directly by a large pool of clinical experts while verifying the true business market with industry members. 





“Most investors are strictly capital providers. FundRx is different. Not only did they help us secure the capital we need to further develop our lead product, they introduced us to key physicians who helped validate our technology and delivered us valuable market research which we have incorporated into our business strategy and plan for NeuroOne. FundRx has been a true partner and we are honored to be working with them as we enter this next stage of growth,” said Dave Rosa, CEO of NeuroOne.
Muhammedi continued, “In just a short period of time, we have been approached by numerous experts on our platform seeking to work with the NeuroOne team. This further validates the potential of NeuroOne’s technology and its impact on the neurology industry.”
FundRx Background
FundRx’s mission is to accelerate the development of early stage healthcare companies.

Unique Properties 
Patient One NeuroOne™ supplies advanced medinutritional support for focus, memory and mood. NeuroOne activates serotonin (5HT-1a) receptors, promotes healthy cerebral blood flow, supports neurotransmitter production, provides antioxidant protection against brain oxidative stress, and supplies vital building block nutrition for neurogenesis – the creation of new brain cells. NeuroOne is an ideal formula for optimizing cognitive function, whether supporting mental focus and attention span for students or promoting bright mood and addressing mild memory problems associated with aging.
Key Ingredients
Sharp-PS® Phosphatidylserine:
Sharp-PS® supplies high purity phosphatidylserine (PS), derived from soy through a patented process. PS is a structural component of cells that is found in all biological membranes of plants, animals and other forms of life. The human body contains about 30g of phosphatidylserine, about half of which is found in the brain. 
This orthomolecule is a raw material in neurogenesis, the creation of new brain cells. PS promotes brain cellular energy and catalyzes neurotransmitter production, promoting communication between brain cells. Pre-clinical and clinical studies support improved cognitive function with oral administration of phosphatidylserine.
Because neuronal cells do not readily regenerate, it is important that these cells have a superior survival mechanism. High levels of PS in neuronal membranes were shown to be important for neuronal survival by facilitating several important cellular processes. Maintaining PS levels in neuronal tissues has been associated with normal and efficient signal transduction processes, efficient neuronal glucose consumption and other biological pathways that are crucial for normal and healthy cognitive and mental functions.
Sharp-GPC™ Glycerophosphatidylcholine:
Glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) is a naturally occurring phospholipid and essential brain nutrient that is a bioavailable source of choline and a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is found in abundant concentrations when we are born, particularly in brain tissue. As a normal part of the aging process, levels in the cell decrease over time. In the diet, GPC is normally presented in low amounts, in food such as milk, eggs and meat. NeuroOne supplies Sharp-GPC, high purity, soy-derived phosphatidylcholine that boosts acetylcholine levels in the brain to optimize central neurotransmission, promoting clear cognition and sharp memory. It has also been studied for its support in head trauma recovery.

BaCognize® Bacopa monnieri:
The neurotransmitter serotonin is key for higher-level cognitive function including working memory and measures of focus and mood. Brewed concoctions containing Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi) has long been a part of daily life for children and adults in India. Bacopa extracts are widely used in integrative medicine to assist with cognitive function. However, not all Bacopa compounds are equally active, and not all extracts are the same.
BaCognize® extract is a proprietary, concentrated, clinically researched extract of Bacopa monnieri which has undergone rigorous scientific validation. Clinical research indicates Bacopa offers broad benefits for cognitive health, linked to three major neuro-supportive mechanisms: neurotransmitter receptor binding activity, antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory activity.
Standardized to 45% baccosides, this extract of Bacopa monnieri has shown potent activity at the site of human serotonin (5HT-1a) receptors and has been shown to promote aspects of cognitive performance, memory and mood. It may help address fuzzy thinking and forgetfulness.
Ginkgo Biloba & Vinpocetine:
Neurons are completely reliant on a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose, which is delivered to them by the blood. Neurological tissue is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress because of its high demand for oxygen, high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in neural membrane phospholipids, and low antioxidant defenses. Both of these antioxidant botanicals are vasodilators that improve cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation, supporting healthy brain energy and optimizing delivery of NeuroOne’s neuronutrient complex. Ginkgo also supports acetylcholine availability. 
Botanical Neuro Complex:
With grapeseed, trans-resveratrol, quercetin, ginger, and Perluxan® hops, NeuroOne’s Botanical Neuro Complex supplies dual-action nutritional support for key factors associated with cognitive decline: It modulates brain inflammation and supplies abundant antioxidant activity to neutralize brain oxidative stress.
Soy Lecithin:
  
Soy lecithin contains a mixture of phospholipids isolated from soybeans that are essential for every cell of the human body. Lecithin is an integral part of the cell membranes, the protective sheaths surrounding the brain, muscle and nerve cells and also plays a vital role in maintaining brain functions. Lecithin provides the phospholipid choline, a precursor to acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter for normal brain functioning that is associated with improved memory. Various studies support the use of lecithin as an adjunctive therapy for cognitive function.

FundRx Inc., an early stage healthcare venture capital firm, today announced that it has invested in NeuroOne Inc., a next generation, platform technology company focused on developing advanced neuromonitoring and neuromodulating products. FundRx participated in a $1.2 million seed round which will be used to accelerate NeuroOne's lead product, a neurodiagnostic solution for the treatment of epilepsy. NeuroOne's core technology was developed in partnership with the Mayo Clinic and the University of Wisconsin."NeuroOne's technology platform will add significant value both for payors and patients specifically in the way we manage treatments for epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological disorders. This is an example where innovation in other fields, such as semiconductors, have a direct impact on improving healthcare once the human science catches up," said Zeshan Muhammedi, CEO at FundRx.FundRx's network of neurologists, neurosurgeons and diagnostic experts evaluated NeuroOne through its Peer Review Council process. This Council is an integral part of the FundRx diligence process as it helps evaluate a company's core scientific merits directly by a large pool of clinical experts while verifying the true business market with industry members."Most investors are strictly capital providers. FundRx is different. Not only did they help us secure the capital we need to further develop our lead product, they introduced us to key physicians who helped validate our technology and delivered us valuable market research which we have incorporated into our business strategy and plan for NeuroOne. FundRx has been a true partner and we are honored to be working with them as we enter this next stage of growth," said Dave Rosa, CEO of NeuroOne.Muhammedi continued, "In just a short period of time, we have been approached by numerous experts on our platform seeking to work with the NeuroOne team. This further validates the potential of NeuroOne's technology and its impact on the neurology industry."FundRx BackgroundFundRx's mission is to accelerate the development of early stage healthcare companies. The firm has built a technology enabled platform which enables companies to access capital but also the diligence, resources, and connections they need to build and grow their businesses. FundRx's platform consists of 2,600 physicians, scientists, and industry experts from some of the world's leading institutions including Harvard University, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Stanford University and Tufts University.To date, FundRx has funded 11 healthcare start-ups including EpiBone, a revolutionary bone reconstruction company; Saferide, an on-demand non-emergency transportation company; Soundbite Medical Solutions, a cardiovascular medical technology company developing a proprietary shockwave technology to address significant unmet clinical needs in interventional cardiology; and SnapMD, a cloud-based virtual care management telemedicine company. FundRx was founded in 2015 by Zeshan Muhammedi, Gurdane Bhutani and Justin Martin.About NeuroOneNeuroOne's mission is to provide comprehensive neuromodulation cEEG monitoring and treatment solutions for patients suffering from epilepsy and other nerve related disorders that result in superior patient outcomes with reduced overall costs. The company is headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota and is currently pursuing a near-term FDA approval for its lead product through the 510(k) submission process. For more information visit, http://www.neurooneinc.com.About FundRxFounded in 2015 and based in New York, FundRx is an early stage healthcare venture capital firm. The firm seeks to fund, support and build high impact start-up companies pursuing novel research and new models of care. FundRx works closely with physicians, scientists, and industry partners to ensure quality companies receive the resources they need to move their innovations from the lab to the clinic.
