Welcome to PPMA






  




















Finding Value
To seek outperformance we focus on measuring both fundamentals and relative value. This approach is visible across the asset classes and strategies we manage.









Earning Trust
We earn the trust of clients throughout the world by seeking superior investment results. Each component of our business reflects this goal — our staff, our infrastructure and our processes.









Sharing Our Views
Recent market volatility has resulted in a favorable credit-picking landscape. At the least, fundamentals don't present a significant headwind, and valuations in certain sectors have become more attractive.

PPMA - Clients





  












Clients
PPMA was founded in 1990 to manage assets for Jackson and other affiliates of our UK Parent. As a result, our history is rooted in the deep focus on investment fundamentals and risk analysis we believe necessary to successfully manage assets underlying insurance contracts. Although we have expanded the services we offer to other client types over the years, we have continued to strengthen this focus as we've evolved, using robust research and analysis to identify investment value across the portfolios we serve. 
AUM by Account Type*

Portfolio  Types
As PPMA's affiliated group of companies has grown its insurance and asset management businesses, its range of investment objectives and needs has also expanded. We have helped support these needs by developing in-house expertise across a wide spectrum of asset classes, strategies and portfolio types.
Today, we manage portfolios for investors located throughout the world, primarily concentrated in the US, Europe and Asia. The types of investors and mandates we serve both directly and through our affiliates include the following:

Separate accounts for:

Total Return mandates
Insurance mandates



Funds:

Advisory
Subadvisory


Collateralized loan/debt obligations (CLO/CDOs)


AUM by Client Region*

* As of 31 December 2016. Includes assets of PPM Finance Inc., an affiliate that  manages assets that are not securities, such as commercial mortgage loans and  other real estate investments. As of 31 December 2016, PPM America managed  approximately $101 billion.






















PPMA - Strategies






  











Investment Approach
We  believe in active management based on our fundamental observation that markets  are inefficient and that true underlying value is not always reflected in  price. This leaves opportunity, in our opinion, for investors with the skilled  personnel, infrastructure and insight necessary to identify and monetize dislocations.  We believe we are one such investor. 
Our Investment Approach*
Research based: In  order to identify market inefficiencies, we measure fundamental value through  deep research performed by experienced professionals.
Relative value-driven: We  select investments based not only on their fundamental merit but also on their  valuations relative to comparable investments.
Focused on risk  measurement and management: As  an active investment manager, we are in the business of taking risk. Our  processes and systems are built to ensure that the risks we take are measured,  transparent, and in line with our clients’ objectives.
Supported by industry experts and team continuity: Our  portfolio managers average over 20 years of industry experience and  approximately 15 years at PPMA. These levels of expertise and stability bring a  wealth of knowledge to each investment decision.
Underpinned by cross-team communication: Even  the best research and investment insights are ineffective if not properly  circulated. To maximize the flow of information, we have designed our processes  and culture to encourage communication and cross-team idea generation.

PPMA - Market Outlook







  











Macro Update
Lower long-term interest rates, a weaker US dollar and lower oil prices – these price trends have run counter to expectations entering 2017, but have been driven by a macro environment dominated by changing central bank policy and expectations around global economic growth and the Trump administration.
