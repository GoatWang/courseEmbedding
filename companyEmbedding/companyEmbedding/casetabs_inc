About Casetabs - Surgery Coordination made easy





























About Casetabs 

Casetabs enables you to know 
                what's happening with 
              your case schedule wherever you are, in real-time.  







our mission and approach
 Built on the experience of being from the healthcare space, Casetabs offers a fresh and innovative approach to case communication and collaboration.



Our Mission
Casetabs believes better case communication can substantially impact the quality and efficiency of our healthcare system. How? Each year, thousands of cases are delayed, cancelled, or begin with sub-optimal equipment. This doesn't just frustrate healthcare workers and add unnecessary cost, it negatively affects patient care. Better communication creates clarity, drives efficiency and increases accuracy throughout the care process.





Our Approach
From surgery center administrators to medical device product managers and healthcare entrepreneurs, everyone on our team brings valuable experience and insight to help shape our surgery coordination app.

Together with our customers, we constantly strive to make the best surgery coordination app even better. We work fast and are highly responsive to customer needs, which is what our customers love most about Casetabs.

The Problem
 Traditional surgery coordination is fragmented, error prone and inefficient. Consequences include:
 Wasted time
 Case cancellations
 Financial losses




The Solution
Casetabs creates a central hub for all case communication. Benefits include: 
 Time savings
 Improved patient care
 Increased profitability









The Proof
Multiple examples of bottom-line improvements









Increase staff efficiency 
Real-time visibility to add-on, changed, and canceled cases enables staff to respond quicker and significantly lessen the number of communication points via text, email, phone, and word of mouth for any changes to those cases. In other words, no more "telephone game."
                          
 Read how Crown Point Surgery Center realized 696% ROI











Reduce cancellations 
Casetabs creates a central hub for sharing case information and updates between surgeons, anesthesiologists, clinical staff, office staff and vendor reps. The app reduces the likelihood of missing or inaccurate information, errors or an overall communication breakdown.

                            
 Read how South Bay saved $3,500+/mo 










Optimize patient flow
Access to case updates right when they happen, makes day of tactical communication easier by improving inter-department connectivity so that all departments can perform their roles more efficiently. The Casetabs Digital surgery boards unite departments to increase collaboration, emphasize team work, and shared decision making. 
 Read full South Bay case study here 










Increase physician satisfaction 
Streamline planning with surgeons and anesthesia by sharing case schedules and changes seamlessly through an app that's accessible on a phone, tablet, or computer.  










Improve patient care 
More informed staff can provide better care to both patients and family members. The digital surgery boards enable key people to follow the care process from check-in to case complete.  










Automated vendor coordination 
Track the status of all vendor requests from confirmed to completed and avoid last minute fire drills since reps are alerted in real-time (via text and e-mail) if any case details change. 














Get on the same page
without using a page.
Arrive for your surgeries informed with the latest case updates so you can deliver exceptional care.  From anywhere and on any device, Casetabs gives you real-time access to the important information you need to serve your patients.  We make sure you're always in the loop! 









Digital Communication. Real ROI.
 With Casetabs, you have a central hub for surgery teams to communicate across all departments, including the waiting room, front desk, pre-op, post-op, and in the OR suite.  The result?  Happier physicians, better informed patients, a more confident team, and substantial productivity gains.









Testimonials
Surgery centers are using Casetabs to achieve new levels of communication, effienciency and productivity.





The amount of frustration that has been removed from my day is insurmountable, and I can spend more of my energy focused on my patients and their safety. Working without Casetabs is not an option anymore.  - Amy Ishmael, Crown Point Surgery Center




Casetabs gets everyone on the same page including our clinical staff, front office, reps and physician offices. If you have access to Casetabs, there is no reason not to know exactly what's going on at our center.  - Tommy Valashanas, Surgery Center of South Bay




Casetabs makes communication better for our sales reps, sterile processing and OR staff. It is extremely valuable, especially by reducing the number of phone calls, text messages and emails. Everyone on the case team is automatically updated.   -Laurie Wamsley, Capital City Surgery Center

Casetabs, Inc. Key Developments

United Surgical Partners International Signs Agreement with Casetabs to Streamline and Enhance Surgical Case Coordination
Jul 19 17
Casetabs announced that United Surgical Partners International (USPI) has selected Casetabs to aid in case coordination for its ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). Casetabs’ cloud-based surgery coordination application will provide USPI-designated ASCs with an intuitive, central hub for all case-related communication and collaboration, digital surgery boards and physician office connectivity. Casetabs eliminates fragmented chains of communication like email, text, phone, faxing and whiteboards. Real-time case information and updates are delivered to everyone involved in patient care including center staff, physicians and their office staff, vendor reps, patients and caregivers, either through a web-enabled app or through the Casetabs native mobile app (iPhone and Android). On average, Casetabs reduces the number of touch points in a surgery from 25 to five, minimizing the risk of communication related errors and allowing caretakers to focus more on patients.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

When using Casetabs, you login and can view all your surgeries, from any desktop, tablet, or smartphone.  Quickly find your case and open it up to see more, check for updates, and collaborate with your team. 

To view and collaborate on that case, simply click on the case and the full details open, with neatly organized tabs, including schedule details, requests, activity log, and documentation.  From the schedule details tab, users can make schedule changes that automatically notify everyone on the case team via email or text.  In the requests tab, members of the case team can assign requests to others on the team and track their progress from requests, confirmed, and completed.  From the activity log tab, you can view all the case activity, including time stamped schedule changes, status updates, and other changes.  From the documentation tab, members of the case team, including the physician offices, can share easily documents that don’t get lost or misinterpreted, like faxes.
