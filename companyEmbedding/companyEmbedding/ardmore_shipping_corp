Get shipping that runs like you run your firm--efficiently and accurately.

The finance and insurance sectors continue to experience challenges. Consolidation and mergers reduce resources and limit staffing. New regulations drive up costs. Closer scrutiny in the handling of personal information makes security a higher priority than ever.
We're ready to streamline finance and insurance shipping with smart transportation and technology solutions. This enables you to optimize resources, control costs, maximize capital, and most importantly, get your shipments to the right place at the right time.

Manage Your RiskWe understand that the reputation of your firm depends on how you handle sensitive documents--mortgage closings, contracts, insurance policies, loans, payouts, and more. We know that if you don't serve your clients well someone else will. Your clients demand premiere service.
It's mission-critical for your time-sensitive documents to arrive on-time and intact. When you choose UPS Proactive Response® along with UPS Next Day Air® service options, dedicated, around-the-clock customer service representatives monitor your critical shipments. It's an extra layer of protection and recovery for the most time-sensitive documents.
UPS Delivery Intercept® allows you to simply phone or log into your UPS tracking system to intercept deliveries when situations suddenly change. You can stop documents before delivery, enabling you to return, hold, or redirect the shipment.
When you do have a problem, you'll want to hedge your risk. We offer several types of Flexible Parcel Insurance to minimize impact to your bottom line. Choose from a menu of affordable protection options to get the exact type of coverage needed for your shipments.



Retain and Grow Your Client BaseWhether you run a financial services firm, a regional bank, or an insurance agency, we can help you serve clients better too. Our fast and reliable UPS Next Day Air service, flexible delivery options with UPS My Choice®, and advanced visibility and tracking technology help ensure you get important documents to your clients on time.
These services, along with nearly 40,000 UPS Drop Box locations nationwide and our broad portfolio of returns solutions, help you to get documents signed and back more quickly. For example, you can drop off your shipment 24 hours a day and enjoy later pickup times to meet the demands of your busy schedule.

 Background








Ardmore Shipping Corporation (“Ardmore”) is engaged in the ownership and operation of product and chemical tankers in worldwide trade.
Ardmore commenced operations through its predecessor company in 2010, an opportune time to create a new shipping company with ambitious long-term growth plans. Ardmore has developed into a first-class organization dedicated to the very best operating practices, customer service and operational efficiency – enabled by a solid financial foundation to support well-timed growth and the agility to seize new opportunities.
Ardmore provides shipping services to customers through voyage charters, commercial pools and time charters. It enjoys close working relationships with its key commercial and technical management partners, and views the continued development of these relationships as crucial to its continued success.
At Ardmore we understand the challenges of international shipping operations and what it takes to excel; no matter the size of the company, Ardmore believes that its seafarers are as crucial to its success as the team ashore that supports them. Through its technical and commercial management partners and its own in-house expertise, Ardmore has the global network in place to support its seafarers and deliver shipping services safely, decisively and effectively to its customers.

 Philosophy







Shipping is an operationally intensive business where companies work in a constantly changing commercial environment, are subject to stringent regulations, and trade to all parts of the globe.  Furthermore, shipping companies compete in a cyclical and capital-intensive business environment which rewards only those who keep a sharp lookout for opportunities, have the resources and resolve to act on them, and maintain a tight control on risks and costs.
Ardmore embraces the challenges of this complex and competitive environment, where in order to excel we must:

Have a total dedication to quality of operations, crew welfare, health and safety
Commitment to the protection of the environment; working with regulators, authorities and associations to ensure adherence to the highest standards;
Develop a collaborative working relationship with our customers by thoroughly understanding their business objectives, paying attention to detail in operations, and having a commercially flexible approach to solving issues when they arise;
Choose to work with, and maintain a strong and trusting relationship with, the best ‘partner’ companies in order to ensure the highest standards;
Attract high quality seafarers and shore-based professionals by providing an organization with integrity, a clear sense of purpose, a secure shipboard working environment, a stimulating office environment, and an opportunity to grow professionally;
Maintain the trust of oil majors by approaching the vetting process with a complete understanding of their objectives and standards, and by using their feedback to improve and stay at the forefront of best management practices; and
Win the support of experienced shipping financiers through prudent risk management, good financial reporting, and sustaining their confidence in Ardmore’s continued financial viability.

We believe that by concentrating on each of these areas with passion, we will not merely meet, but exceed, the expectations of those who have placed their trust in us, and believe also that it will serve Ardmore well in the long journey ahead.

 Our Ethos







Professionalism. Ardmore believes that seafaring is a profession and not simply an occupation. It seeks to attract, retain and develop those who are, or have the ambition and ability to become, consummate professionals. What defines a professional seafarer? Expertise. Reliability. Pride in a job well done. Ardmore seeks the same in shore staff regardless of function.
Integrity: We believe that integrity is the real foundation that Ardmore is built on. Integrity means acting honestly and ethically, and doing what you said you would do. Ardmore expects that all of its employees afloat and ashore will act with integrity at all times.
Respect: Ardmore delivers shipping services in a harsh and demanding environment, where the consequences of disregard range anywhere from significant to catastrophic. Respect is about doing the job right, and doing the right thing at all times, whether for customers, for shipmates, or for the environment.
Our Policies
Our policies for Health, Safety and Environmental Protection are short and simple, but nevertheless effective if properly implemented.. They are based on our many years of experience in the industry in some of today’s leading and most admired shipping companies. They are intentionally short enough to be memorized, to ensure that those directly engaged in front-line management and operations are familiar with them and mind them every day.

SummaryArdmore Shipping offers a very attractive entry point for anyone desiring exposure to the product and chemical tanker markets.ASC is much smaller in scale than rival Scorpio Tankers, but also has a stronger balance sheet and less conflicts of interest.The company is currently capable of internal cash yields of up to 20% - a fact easily overlooked due to rapid fleet expansion.The dividend of 10c only represents a current payout of 25% - I expect to see an increase by 2H-15.Investors desiring exposure to this market should consider ASC: 100% upside is feasible if market conditions hold.Note: Value Investor's Edge subscribers had an early look at this article.
Background
Ardmore Shipping (NYSE:ASC) was established in 2010 to pursue growth with a modern product and chemical tanker fleet. The company is headquartered in Ireland, but incorporated in the Marshall Islands, and flags all of its vessels in the Marshall Islands to further reduce tax liabilities. Unlike many of its counterparts in the shipping industry, Ardmore is a product of private investment via Greenbriar Equity Group, and doesn't have the familial ties which are common in Greek shipping companies. This structure appears to reduce the related-party conflicts of interests, which are common in this industry, and makes Ardmore a more investible vehicle than Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG), which has a few questionable related-party structures.
Public Company History
Ardmore went public August 1st, 2013, at $14 per share, well below the expected range of $15-17. When ASC went public, my view was that it was an "also-ran" to the already rolling Scorpio Tankers . My view can be seen below from StockTalks and Twitter:



Since IPO, ASC has paid out 67c in dividends, for a 21-month return of -5.7%. Scorpio Tankers opened at $10 on August 1st and paid out 62c in dividends, for a 21-month return of 1.2%. Neither has done well, but it seems I made the initial call correctly - but what about now?
Ardmore and Scorpio tankers have both been savvy managers of their equity, but the latter has been much more aggressive by trading vessel orders and repurchasing during dips and recently raising new equity. Ardmore has been more "slow and steady," which is probably a better long-term way to approach this market. Ardmore did institute a $20M share repurchase program in November 2014. Since then, it repurchased $1.28M in 4Q-14, but nothing in Q1-15. Judging by these actions, management views the equity as fairly valued in the $10-$12 range.
Fleet Specifics
Ardmore has a 24 vessel fleet, fully delivered, with an average age of 3.6 years and total DWT of 970,723. Compare this to STNG, which boasts a fleet of over 5.2 million DWT. However, based on current market capitalization, it trades for a similar valuation. Scorpio Tankers is more leveraged, hence the need for a recent share offering to support continued expansion.

Earnings Power
The below chart highlights the results for Q1-15, reported on May 5th. The most impressive facet is that ASC operated this quarter with only 16 vessels. With a fully expanded fleet and current market rates, we can safely assume at least a 50% jump in both net income and cash profits, likely slightly more due to the scale of overhead. See the below chart from Ardmore's recent Q1 presentation to see the evidence of reduced overhead when the fleet size increases.

In shipping companies, operating cash flow, or simplified "cash profits," is a better way to look at sustainability and profitability. Depreciation & amortization are certainly "real" expenses, but an investor is buying these types of entities for the stream of cash flows. Obviously, depreciation is a critical expense when considering eventual fleet renewal. In the case of ASC, (necessary) renewal is 15-20 years out and is virtually irrelevant from a discounted cash flow perspective.

Take these earnings, add 50%, and you have an entity spinning off nearly $2.50 in cash flow - roughly a 20% internal yield to the current share price of $12.53.
At these current rates and share prices, ASC is better off building scale while paying a token dividend of 10c per quarter, but if rates stay relatively strong, I would expect an increase in the dividend to at least 15c prior to fall 2015. If Ardmore pays out 50% of its future "cash profit" (approx. 30c quarterly) and can secure 50% debt financing for newbuilds, it can grow the fleet by 2 vessels per year without tapping the equity markets. If ASC continues to pay 10c, it can grow the fleet by up to 4 vessels per year, assuming yard pricing remains cheap.
Market Prospects
Shipping is a violently cyclical market, as seen by the devastation in the public markets. Despite a recent uptick in rates for crude, product, and chemical tankers, the broad investment market remains skeptical - as clearly seen by the poor performance of both STNG and ASC stocks. The following metrics are taken from Ardmore's Q1-15 presentation from 2 weeks ago:


The global fleet continues to grow, but the order book is beginning to decline again. The high rate of global supply makes me nervous, especially compared to the flat fleet levels from 1996-2004. Shipping companies aren't as bearish as they were in 2012, but levels are close. The time to invest in these types of ventures is when everyone is running for the hills. It's rather surprising that nobody heard the music ending back in 2008-2009 with that shocking order book rate.

The chemical order book is similar, albeit with an even more shocking peak in 2008. The order book is picking back up, which is a bearish indicator, but global fleet supply has been practically flat since 2012. A Reuters article from November 2013 calls for a strong bullish turn in the chemical tanker market. Fundamentally speaking, an increase in global chemical trade makes sense, and the current levels look encouraging, especially considering Ardmore's stock is still lagging (although up 25% since the Reuters article). Arguably, a lot of this increase is also due to Ardmore's stellar Q1-15 performance, spurred by strong operational efficiencies and strong product tanker spot trades (below).


Conclusion
Ardmore is very attractively priced if you believe the future is bright for the product and chemical tanker market. I still personally favor STNG due to the more aggressive nature of management, but the handling of the latest public offering makes me question its foresight a bit.
Ardmore is capable of internal cash yields exceeding 20%, perhaps even higher if the market rates improve further. I am skeptical of the longevity of product rates, but I see a strong setup in the chemical sector. Many of Ardmore's vessels are dual purpose, so this will provide more flexibility in case the markets head in different directions.
I don't currently own any Ardmore shares, but I might add some in the next few days to further diversify my STNG holdings by limiting my company-specific risk. For anyone wanting access to their sector, I recommend taking a serious look at both ASC and STNG.
I am hesitant to provide the exact price targets, but if current market conditions persist, ASC could easily double.

Ardmore Shipping To Host Investor And Analyst Event On May 24, 2017


May 10, 2017 4:15 PM EDT









Short Interest In Ardmore Shipping Falls 16.2%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 544,272 share decrease in total short interest for Ardmore Shipping Corp , to 2,819,051, a decrease of 16.18% since 04/13/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

May 10, 2017 1:29 PM EDT













Relative Strength Alert For Ardmore Shipping
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Ardmore Shipping Corp presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Oct 31, 2016 11:34 AM EDT













Short Interest Makes 25.5% Move For ASC
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 08/31/2016 settlement date, which shows a 556,882 share increase in total short interest for Ardmore Shipping Corp , to 2,740,231, an increase of 25.51% since 08/15/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Sep 13, 2016 1:19 PM EDT













Cash Dividend On The Way From Ardmore Shipping (ASC)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 8/12/16, Ardmore Shipping Corp will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.11, payable on 8/31/16. As a percentage of ASC's recent stock price of $7.97, this dividend works out to approximately 1.38%, so look for shares of Ardmore Shipping Corp to trade 1.38% lower — all else being equal — when ASC shares open for trading on 8/12/16.

Get shipping that runs like you run your firm--efficiently and accurately.

The finance and insurance sectors continue to experience challenges. Consolidation and mergers reduce resources and limit staffing. New regulations drive up costs. Closer scrutiny in the handling of personal information makes security a higher priority than ever.
We're ready to streamline finance and insurance shipping with smart transportation and technology solutions. This enables you to optimize resources, control costs, maximize capital, and most importantly, get your shipments to the right place at the right time.

Manage Your RiskWe understand that the reputation of your firm depends on how you handle sensitive documents--mortgage closings, contracts, insurance policies, loans, payouts, and more. We know that if you don't serve your clients well someone else will. Your clients demand premiere service.
It's mission-critical for your time-sensitive documents to arrive on-time and intact. When you choose UPS Proactive Response® along with UPS Next Day Air® service options, dedicated, around-the-clock customer service representatives monitor your critical shipments. It's an extra layer of protection and recovery for the most time-sensitive documents.
UPS Delivery Intercept® allows you to simply phone or log into your UPS tracking system to intercept deliveries when situations suddenly change. You can stop documents before delivery, enabling you to return, hold, or redirect the shipment.
When you do have a problem, you'll want to hedge your risk. We offer several types of Flexible Parcel Insurance to minimize impact to your bottom line. Choose from a menu of affordable protection options to get the exact type of coverage needed for your shipments.



Retain and Grow Your Client BaseWhether you run a financial services firm, a regional bank, or an insurance agency, we can help you serve clients better too. Our fast and reliable UPS Next Day Air service, flexible delivery options with UPS My Choice®, and advanced visibility and tracking technology help ensure you get important documents to your clients on time.
These services, along with nearly 40,000 UPS Drop Box locations nationwide and our broad portfolio of returns solutions, help you to get documents signed and back more quickly. For example, you can drop off your shipment 24 hours a day and enjoy later pickup times to meet the demands of your busy schedule.
Take advantage of growth opportunities through finding and serving international clients with fast, reliable UPS Worldwide Express®. This one- to three-day shipping service offers guaranteed morning delivery times around the world.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
