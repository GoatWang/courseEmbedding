FLEET MANAGEMENT FOR

Constant ConnectionConstant Improvement








In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 13, we think the most important thing you can do is learn more about industrial truck management systems.
Here are 3 great resources to find out how forklift management systems can make your fleet run safer—and smarter:



 
Read these Case Studies
 
See how Impact Sensing is now automatic and foolproof
 
It’s hard to manage what can’t be seen. Without a fleet management system, businesses are operating blind—lacking the data they need to improve the safety of their fleet operations, increase the productivity of their employees, and use their assets more efficiently.
Intelligent, software-based Vehicle Management Systems (VMS) begin collecting data as soon as an operator logs in to access a vehicle. Once it’s started, the system automatically collects data on exactly how the vehicle is used. It’s this data that provides the visibility that allows you to optimize your resources.

POLAROID announces exit from Instant Film 
In February 2008, the Polaroid Corporation announced that it will no longer 
    be manufacturing instant film products. 
If you currently use Polaroid instant film, this does not mean your film 
    based camera will no longer be useful. We will continue to supply Fujifilm's 
    instant film at competitive prices, your cost per print will remain low and 
    you can continue profiting from passport photos!

Enterprise Fleet Management | Distribution Center Fleet Tracking | Fleet Monitoring


































































DISTRIBUTION

Customers Are Counting On You.You Can Count On Us







Distribution

The distribution center is the beating heart of the supply chain. Without a clear understanding of your unload, put-away, cross-dock, pick, pack, and ship processes, it’s nearly impossible to keep operations moving smoothly. You need to know that your fleet is optimized, you have clear communication paths with your operators, and your vehicles are always in the right place at the right time.
I.D. Systems is driven by a commitment that all of our products and enterprise fleet management solutions result in more intelligence, deeper insight, and stronger connections to assets and operators. The key to that kind of fundamental improvement is the accurate collection and analysis of key performance indicators in order to eliminate inefficiencies.




 By gaining clear and detailed visibility into vehicle utilization, one national distribution enterprise was able to cut the size of its total fleet by more than 11 percent. 





What can intelligent asset management do for you?


Productivity
Gaining insight into the day-to-day processes of your operators is critical to increasing productivity levels and ensuring you’re getting the most out of your workforce. After all, you’re invested in your operators, and you want to ensure you’re using them as effectively as possible.
 
Intelligent asset management systems serve as your distribution center’s right hand, helping you to:




Balance tasks among operators





Analyze deadhead time vs. time/distance travelled





Optimize your fleet with time motion reports and peak utilization analyses





Associate all vehicle activity to a specific operator in real time






Safety & Security
The costs associated with inadequate provisions for safety and security go far beyond anything reflected in an accounting ledger. If the distribution center is the heart of supply chain operations, then your vehicles and operators are its lifeblood. You need the ability to keep a constant close eye and ensure documented procedures are being followed.
 
Smart fleet management solutions from I.D. Systems give you the capabilities to:




Customize individual or group authorized users per vehicle





Instantly locate vehicles to eliminate time spent searching for equipment





Immediately modify permission levels without manual entry





Gain full visibility into vehicle and operator locations and activity





Lock-out/tag-out unsafe vehicles






Maintenance Costs
Perhaps the most frustrating source of unnecessary costs in the distribution center is the habit of waiting until a small maintenance issue becomes a critical one before addressing it. We all know that preventive maintenance can save significant amounts, but without detailed insight into your fleet’s performance, it’s nearly impossible to implement a system that allows you to predict maintenance needs.
 
You need the intelligence to:




Identify emerging maintenance issues before they completely disable vehicles





Constantly monitor oil pressure, temperature, fuel level, battery voltage, and other data points





Require pre-shift electronic checklists to stay on top of maintenance issues





Automate battery rotation datafor battery swap systems





Optimize battery life management













PowerFleet
Getting your material to the line and your products to distribution should never hold up your factory operations. Optimize your service vehicles with PowerFleet.








Analytics
Make your enterprise fleet management system as intelligent as your distribution center with our advanced analytics IQ solutions.

FLEET MANAGEMENT FOR

Constant ConnectionConstant Improvement








In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 13, we think the most important thing you can do is learn more about industrial truck management systems.
Here are 3 great resources to find out how forklift management systems can make your fleet run safer—and smarter:



 
Read these Case Studies
 
See how Impact Sensing is now automatic and foolproof
 
It’s hard to manage what can’t be seen. Without a fleet management system, businesses are operating blind—lacking the data they need to improve the safety of their fleet operations, increase the productivity of their employees, and use their assets more efficiently.
Intelligent, software-based Vehicle Management Systems (VMS) begin collecting data as soon as an operator logs in to access a vehicle. Once it’s started, the system automatically collects data on exactly how the vehicle is used. It’s this data that provides the visibility that allows you to optimize your resources.
