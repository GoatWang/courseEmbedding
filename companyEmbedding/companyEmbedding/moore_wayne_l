Few success stories come without some sort of support group. Those are the people the winners thank at awards ceremonies, because the so-called little people were every bit as important as the stars.Kurt Moore has a support group that in many ways is unrivaled. One of four athletic siblings spawned from two ultra-supportive and positive parents, Moore graduated from Norwayne last month as one of the greatest athletes in school history.“If you’re tired one day and don’t really want to go, I have my brother (Kollin), who will say, ‘Come on, let’s go run,’” Moore said. “We compete with each other a little bit to see who’s better and who wants to work more.”
Moore’s senior year started with a spectacular soccer season. He scored 20 goals and assisted on seven others en route to being named Post Player of the Year and earning second-team All-Ohio in Division III.It continued in the winter when he was one of the best wrestlers in the state. Working at 160 pounds, Moore finished his season 48-4 and placed fourth in Division III, earning another All-Ohio honor.It was at the state wrestling tournament that the Moore family was at their combined best. Kurt Moore was somewhere in the wings waiting for his state semifinal bout while Kollin, at 152 pounds, was wrestling in his.Kollin won to advance to the state championship. Kurt fell to Jared Mattin of Delta. The 9-7 defeat came after the match extended through three overtimes.“That was probably my worst time being a parent,” mom Julie Moore said. “I’ve never been so happy for my kids and so upset for my kids in a 15-minute time period. We went from the highest high to a real heart-wrenching low. It was really hard to celebrate for Kollin when you are just heartbroken for Kurt.”It wasn’t that hard for Kurt, though. Not long after his devastating defeat, he tweeted to his brother to “be Norwayne’s first state champ. No doubt in my mind u can do it.”That’s the kind of family unity that has led to the Moores’ success. Before Kurt, older sister Katelyn also was a two-sport All-Ohioan, reaching the top level in gymnastics and track. She now competes in track at Ashland University.Kollin will be a junior this year at Norwayne. Assuming enough players can be rounded up to have a soccer team, he will be a standout in that sport. He’ll also be a favorite to win a state wrestling title.Youngest sib Kloe, a dead ringer for Katelyn (Kollin and Kurt also are major look-alikes), will be a freshman this year at Norwayne. An A-student at the middle school, she will be the last in what will wind up nearly a decade of Moore children competing for the Bobcats.“We talk about it all the time,” Julie Moore said of her athletic offspring. “It’s just something we love. We love to watch them. We love to take them to practices. We all do it together. People say, ‘When do you have time for a family?’ That is our family time. It’s just what we’ve always done as a family.”Kurt Moore went on to wrap up his senior year as a member of Norwayne’s track team. He was a Wayne County Athletic League placer in two events.The combination of soccer, wrestling and track, not to mention a 3.9 grade-point average, make Moore The Post’s 14-school coverage area male athlete of the year for 2012-13.“I’m really happy with it,” Moore said of his final school year. “I’m just glad that I was motivated enough to put the work in, the extra work, and it paid off.”
It’s worth noting that honoring Moore with this distinction wasn’t an easy choice and one needn’t look far to find his closest competitor. Roaming the same halls, and the same wrestling mats and tracks, was Jon Zimmerly. A two-sport All-Ohioan himself, Zimmerly fashioned quite a spectacular year in his own right, a year which included Post Player of the Year honors in football, district qualification and 30-win wrestling season, and a trip to the state track meet, where he placed in the 4x200-meter relay.“Whenever you go to the weight room or see a football practice, he’s always in the front of the group pushing everybody,” Moore said of Zimmerly. “He definitely puts all the work in that he needs and more.”The two will have plenty of time to reminisce about their Norwayne glory days. Both are headed this fall to Malone University, Zimmerly to play football and Moore to play soccer. They will also be roommates.At Malone, Moore plans to major in nursing. His long-term goal is to be a nurse anesthetist.His athletic workload, meanwhile, will be cut down significantly. Soccer will be Moore’s lone sport, but that’s enough for him.He can always reflect on his other sports as he looks back on his days at Norwayne, which he said flew by, probably a product of keeping so busy.“I’m going to play college soccer next year, so it’s not like my sports are completely over,” he said. “Wrestling was a little disappointing, but there’s no way to get that back. I’m happy with everything.”

        The majority of Post readers say they would pay for some sort of national health care. Which of these options for coverage would you prefer?

 Make Medicaid a national basic insurance free to all Americans
                                



 Expand Medicare to all Americans
                                



 Combine Medicare and Medicaid into one national health insurance plan for all
                                



 Offer one new national comprehensive plan and subsidize individuals based on income
                                



 Offer one new national comprehensive plan and subsidize individuals based on age
                                



 None of the above – the government should stay out of health care
