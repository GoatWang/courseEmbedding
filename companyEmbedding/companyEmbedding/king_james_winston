            Why did Sir winston churchill said this about Bible?
        


Sir Winston Churchill has some pertinent things to say about the Authorised Version (AV) of the Protestant Bible, which is also widely known as the "King James Version (KJV)".
"THE AUTHORISED VERSION OF THE BIBLE WAS PUBLISHED IN 1611 BY THE WILL AND COMMAND OF HIS MAJESTY KING JAMES THE 1ST WHOSE...

 Sir Winston Churchill has some pertinent things to say about the Authorised Version (AV) of the Protestant Bible, which is also widely known as the "King James Version (KJV)". 
"THE AUTHORISED VERSION OF THE BIBLE WAS PUBLISHED IN 1611 BY THE WILL AND COMMAND OF HIS MAJESTY KING JAMES THE 1ST WHOSE NAME IT BEARS TILL TODAY." 
The Roman Catholics, believing as they do that the Protestants have mutilated the Book of God, are yet aiding and abetting the Protestant "crime" by forcing their native converts to purchase the Authorised Version (AV) of the Bible, which is the only Bible available in some 1500 languages of the lesser developed nations of the world. The Roman Catholics milk their cows, but the feeding is left to the Protestants! The overwhelming majority of Christians — both Catholics and Protestant — use the Authorised (AV) or the King James Version (KJV) as it is alternatively called. 
GLOWING TRIBUTES 
GLOWING TRIBUTES GLOWING TRIBUTES GLOWING TRIBUTESGLOWING First published, as Sir Winston says, in 1611, and then revised in 1881 (RV), and now re-revised and brought up to date as the Revised Standard Version (RSV) 1952, and now again re-re-revised in 1971 (still RSV for short). Let us see what opinion Christendom has of this most revised Bible, the RSV:- 
1. "THE FINEST VERSION WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN THE PRESENT CENTURY." — (Church of England Newspaper) 
2. "A COMPLETELY FRESH TRANSLATION BY SCHOLARS OF THE HIGHEST EMINENCE." — (Times literary Supplement) 
3. "THE WELL-LOVED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AUTHORISED VERSION COMBINED WITH A NEW ACCURACY OF TRANSLATION." — (Life and Work) 
4. "THE MOST ACCURATE AND CLOSE RENDERING OF THE ORIGINAL" — (The Times) 
The publishers (Collins) themselves, in their notes on the Bible at the end of their production, say on page 10: "THIS BIBLE (RSV), IS THE PRODUCT OF THIRTY-TWO SCHOLARS, ASSISTED BY AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE REPRESENTING FIFTY CO-OPERATING DENOMINATIONS." Why all this boasting? To make the gullible public buy their product? All these testimonies convince the purchaser that he is backing the right horse, with the purchaser little suspecting that he is being taken for a ride. 
"THE WORLD'S BEST SELLER" 
"THE WORLD'S BEST SELLER" But what about the Authorised Version of the Bible (AV), the "World's Best Seller?" These Revisers, all good salesmen, have some very pretty things to say about it. However, their page iii, paragraph six of the PREFACE of the RSV reads; 
"THE KING JAMES VERSION (alternative description of AV) HAS WITH GOOD REASON BEEN TERMED 'THE NOBLEST MONUMENT OF ENGLISH PROSE.’ ITS REVISERS IN 1881 EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR 'ITS SIMPLICITY, ITS DIGNITY, ITS POWER, ITS HAPPY TURNS OF EXPRESSION ... THE MUSIC OF ITS CADENCES, AND THE FELICITIES OF ITS RHYTHM.’ IT ENTERED, AS NO OTHER BOOK HAS, INTO THE MAKING OF THE PERSONAL CHARACTER AND THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES. WE OWE TO IT AN INCALCULABLE DEBT." 
Can you, dear reader, imagine a more magnificent tribute being paid to the "Book of Books" than the above? I, for one, cannot. Let the believing Christian, now steel himself for the un-kindest blow of all from his own beloved Lawyers of Religion; for in the very same breath they say: 
"YET THE KING JAMES VERSION HAS GRAVE DEFECTS." And, "THAT THESE DEFECTS ARE SO MANY AND SO SERIOUS AS TO CALL FOR REVISION . . ." This is straight from the horse's mouth, i.e. the orthodox Christian scholars of "the highest eminence." Another galaxy of Doctors of Divinity are now required to produce an encyclopedia explaining the cause of those GRAVE AND SERIOUS DEFECTS in their Holy Writ and their reasons for eliminating them.

 The Bible was not authorized by K James but by the Holy Spirit of God 

The KJV is a widespread translation in English but not the first or the last 

The Bible is translated into many languages not only by Protestants but also by Catholics 

just as there are  many translation of the Quran, so there are many translations of the Bible 

As a Catholic Christian, I agree that the KJV has many ideological and theological defects reflected in the lovely translation which was made by learned Anglicans of the early 17th century AD working with the tools of that time and place 

There are no problems with Holy Writ rightly interpreted 

I have far more problems with the Quran and Haddith 
and the claim of the Quran to inspiration and revelation 

Just compare the Quran and New Testament and you will see how much more inspiring and elevating spiritually, morally and theologically 
 the New Testment is 

Live and let live

 Winston Churchill was a politician, not a particularly religious man.  He was entitled to his opinions. 

The KJV (AV) was a monumental and significant achievement. But no translation is without flaws, and the living language of the translation changes over time. That's why it's important to refer to the ancient languages in which the books were written.  Vernacular for study, original for doctrine. 

Translations can reflect the religious biases of the translators, so even if a translation is recommended, its shortcomings should also be noted. 

Blessings.

 Depending upon what date the above comments are drawn from, I would say they ought not to have attempted to revise the authorized version at all since they were incapable of preventing errors from entering into the revision process.  The other alternative here could simply be that these earnest fellows do not comprehend that there are no defects in the entire collection of scriptures.  That it is likely that none of them were actual born again believers in Jesus Christ, there is a very high probability that they are spiritually blind.

 We never acknowledged the kj, let alone authorised it.  

It was translated from a source that didn't recognise Christ's divinity, and had over 3000 words amended. 
The KJB 1611 edition included footnotes referring to the Duetros contained in them, now removed.

 To be honest... I can't even make it through all this text that I suspect is pasted since your expressing an opinion but not really asking a valid question.   

I don't frankly care what Chruchill thought of the bible !Why should anyone care ? He was not a particularly religious man.    why would anyone care ?

    book in the history of English civilization...the King James Version combined homely,
    dignified phrases into a style of great richness and loveliness. It has been a model of
    writing for generations of English-speaking people." 
Online Edition. Downloaded from America Online, May 26,
    1995 
Merit Students Encyclopedia
"The greatest English Bible is the Authorized, or King James,
    Version. Based on Tyndale's translation and original texts, it was produced in 1611 by six
    groups of churchmen at the command of King James I. The King James Bible became the
    traditional Bible of English-speaking Protestants. Its dignified and beautiful style
    strongly influenced the development of literature in the English language. The influence
    can be seen in the works of John Bunyan, John Milton, Herman Melville, and many other
    writers." 
Vol. 3; Crowell-Collier Educational Corporation; 1967,
    1972 ed. p.p. 137, 138 Rev. Holt H. Graham; Rev. Joseph M. Petulla; Mr. Cecil Roth 
Charlton Heston
"...the King James translation has been described as 'the monument of
    English prose' as well as 'the only great work of art ever created by a committee'. Both
    statements are true. Fifty four scholars worked seven years to produce the work from its
    extant texts in Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and English. Such an undertaking can be
    expected to produce great scholarship, but hardly writing as spare and sublime as the King
    James.... 
The authors of several boring translations that have followed over the last fifty
    years mumble that the KJV is "difficult" filled with long words. Have a look
    at the difficult long words that begin the Old Testament, and end the Gospels: 'In the
    beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void;
    darkness was upon the face of the deep.' and 'Now, of the other things which Jesus did, if
    they should be written every one, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books
    that would be written.' Shakespeare aside, there's no comparable writing in the language,
    as has been observed by wiser men than I. 
Over the past several centuries it's been the single book in most households, an
    enormous force in shaping the development of the English language. Carried around the
    world by missionaries, it provided the base by which English is about to become the lingua
    franca of the world in the next century. Exploring it during this shoot [Ten Commandments]
    was one of the most rewarding creative experiences of my life." 
In the Arena: An Autobiography, pp. 554-555 
George Bernard Shaw
"The translation was extraordinarily well done because to the translators what
    they were translating was not merely a curious collection of ancient books written by
    different authors in different stages of culture, but the word of God divinely revealed
    through His chosen and expressly inspired scribes. In this conviction they carried out
    their work with boundless reverence and care and achieved a beautifully artistic
    result...they made a translation so magnificent that to this day the common human
    Britisher or citizen of the United States of North America accepts and worships it as a
    single book by a single author, the book being the Book of Books and the author being God."
    
The Men Behind the King James Version, by G. S. Paine; Baker Book
    House; Grand Rapids, Mich.; 1959, 1977ed., pp. 182-183

Countless people throughout the Bible have been witness to God’s majesty and miracles. Following the teachings found in this record of divine interventions enables us to know God, learn from the lives of His followers, and better understand His will.Order your copy of this sacred scripture as a free gift from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

What happens when we die?
At death, our spirit and physical body are separated. At the Resurrection our spirit and body reunite in a perfected state, never to be separated again.

Our spirits are divine and they are eternal; they existed long before we were born, and they will continue on forever after we die. In many ways we can compare our existence to a three-act play, with a premortal existence, an earthly existence, and a post-mortal existence. While most of us focus only on the act we’re currently taking part in—our life here on earth—God’s plan for us includes our entire existence. We have to exercise faith when trying to understand His vantage point, because our concepts of time and purpose are limited by the mortal lens through which we view them. Accordingly, we have difficulty envisioning the limitlessness of eternity and eternal progression.God’s plan of salvation for us included leaving His presence in the premortal world to achieve the kind of progression unique to an earthly existence. The earth was a place where we could gain physical bodies; exercise agency; grow in wisdom, faith, and compassion; build relationships with others; and perform holy ordinances necessary for our salvation.






Expand Text



During our mortal life we must put forth great effort to perfect ourselves. Unlike our Savior, Jesus Christ, we sin and fall short as we strive for this perfection.

To balance the scales of justice, the Savior atoned for our sins, ensuring that our physical death would not be the end of our progression. This gift of Resurrection is available to all of us, but whether or not we attain a fulness of joy after this life is determined by how we spend our time here on earth. After death we enter the spirit world, where we no longer have physical distractions and where our actions on earth determine the amount of peace and happiness we experience in this new realm. In many ways, we judge ourselves while we await our Resurrection and the Final Judgment of Jesus Christ.That is why this life is a time of testing—because our actions in this life determine our eternal destiny. Those who repent and live valiant lives will feel peace and happiness in the spirit world, which will be for them a state of paradise and rest. Those who live otherwise will become acutely aware of their sins and will be in a spirit prison of their own making. But God is compassionate, and even here, He allows us to progress and to be taught things we still need to learn. We can continue to learn about and benefit from the Atonement, faith in God and Jesus Christ, repentance, and the fulness of the gospel. Saving ordinances can be performed on earth by proxy for those who were not baptized or sealed to their families during their earthly lives, and if these works are accepted by those who have passed on, then these individuals can progress to paradise while awaiting the Resurrection.Humans have lived on the earth in periods of time known as dispensations, and the last dispensation is a period marked by events prophesied by God’s prophets from ancient times. Paul spoke of a future time when all things that are in heaven and on earth would at last be gathered together, and he called it the “dispensation of the fulness of times” (Ephesians 1:10). The prophet Isaiah also wrote of humanity during this time, saying, “They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more” (Isaiah 2:4).



Before Jesus ascended to heaven following His death and Resurrection, He said that He would return to earth in glory. At that time He will serve as our king.

In Isaiah, Daniel, and John we read about Christ dwelling among the inhabitants of earth and ruling over the kingdoms of both earth and heaven. In the book of Revelation we learn that the world will enjoy a thousand years of peace and that, for the duration of the Millennium, Satan will be bound. When we talk about the “end of the world,” it does not mean the end of the earth or humankind but the end of evil. As we read in Genesis and Exodus, the Millennium symbolizes a sabbatical in human history much like the role of the weekly Sabbath day; it is patterned after the Lord’s period of rest following the six periods of the Creation. During the Millennium, the earth will be renewed to its former paradisiacal glory; there will be a refreshment, not a replacement, of the world we know now. The earth will not be destroyed but transformed—glorified—as the disparity between heaven and earth is overcome while Jesus reigns.Just as the world will be renewed and improved, so too will the spirits of the dead be reunited with a perfected body in the Resurrection. As God’s children are resurrected, we will be brought to stand before the Lord, who will ultimately judge us, assigning us to the degree of glory we have earned while living. In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul discusses the three glories of resurrected bodies: one like the sun (celestial), another like the moon (terrestrial), and the third like the stars (telestial) (see verses 40–41). “So also is the resurrection of the dead” (1 Corinthians 15:42). In John 14:2 we read, “In my Father’s house are many mansions. . . . I go to prepare a place for you.” Of the three degrees of eternal glory (celestial, terrestrial, and telestial), even the lowest kingdom surpasses the glory of the earth. But God dwells in the celestial kingdom, and only those whose lives prepared them to live in His presence can also dwell there. While it might seem harsh to deny some of God’s children access to Him in the eternities, we each have agency and are allowed the desires of our hearts. Through our choices on earth, we choose our eternal destiny. Those of us who want to claim the highest degree of exaltation and dwell with our Father are actively earning our place there now while we have earthly bodies and the agency to do so. We do this because we love Him and want to be with Him.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE DIE?
Take the Quiz









Why does life continue after death?
As humans, we tend to define life in terms of our mortal, physical bodies. However, life should really be seen in a much bigger context.

Our spirits—our individual characters—existed before we had bodies, and they will continue to exist after we die. We all lived before this life as spirits with our Heavenly Parents. We each accepted the challenge of receiving a physical body so that we might experience the good and the bad in a way we could not experience them before. During our time on earth, we choose how to act, and in so doing we show whether we are willing to become better individuals, more like our Father in Heaven. But mortal life is just one necessary segment of our eternal journey.When our physical body dies, our spirit continues to live. We continue to exist as the same individuals we were before—but we’ve had the opportunity to grow and progress because of our mortal experiences. Our ability to learn doesn’t end with death either. As spirits we continue to be taught eternal truths, and we choose to accept or reject teachings and ordinances that will prepare us to live again with our Heavenly Father in happiness.

“I’ve been blessed to have peace in my life after the tragic death of my little brother because I believe we will be together again someday.”









How will eternal life look?
We can live again with family and friends who have died. We hope that we—and they—have made choices that will ultimately allow us to be with each other forever in the presence of God.

Mortal birth and death are steps along the eternal path. So is the Resurrection. This reunion of spirit and body was made possible by our Savior, Jesus Christ. Because of His Resurrection, all who have lived on this earth can reclaim their physical bodies in perfected, immortal form. Never again will we experience pain, sickness, or death.All people will be resurrected, and all people will be judged “according to their works” (Revelation 20:13) during this life. Those who have shown obedience to God’s commandments, followed Jesus Christ, and accepted His Atonement will be rewarded as “heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:17).Those who do not choose to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will be judged according to what they have done in this life, but they will not enjoy the full glory of living in the presence of God. And yet, as a loving parent, our Heavenly Father wants His children to return to Him, to experience His glory, and to live eternally, being sealed to spouses and children in “fulness of joy” (Psalm 16:11).

What is the Book of Mormon?
The Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ.

Does it seem possible that God stopped talking to man after the last page of the New Testament? Or the last page of the Old Testament, for that matter? Our ancestors were taught by living prophets, and those prophets recorded holy scripture—profound spiritual lessons embedded in the history of their people. While many of our questions and struggles are similar to those of biblical times, it only makes sense that a loving God would continue guiding His children with additional messages of hope and wisdom applicable to their lives. The Book of Mormon is exactly that: continued revelation from God that serves as a witness to the truths in the Bible and to the divinity and teachings of Jesus Christ.The Book of Mormon answers essential questions that we all have at some point: Is there life after death, and what’s waiting for us on the other side? What is the purpose of life, and how can I find happiness and peace now? Does God know me and hear my prayers? How can I avoid sin and learn to truly repent? How can I become the best possible version of myself?

Like the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an ancient record of God’s teachings to His people.

The Book of Mormon prophets lived in the Americas from approximately 600 BC to AD 400, and they wrote the histories and the powerful spiritual lessons taught to their people. Like us today, the women and men of those times struggled with temptation, searched for wisdom, and led happier lives when they followed the teachings of Jesus Christ. We can recognize ourselves in their stories—inspired and inspiring spiritual records that are similar in form and content to those in the Bible.Faithful Christian prophets wrote and safeguarded the records now contained in the Book of Mormon for centuries before they were compiled by the ancient prophet Mormon. (People often refer to us as “Mormons” because his name is in the book’s title, but we are followers of Jesus Christ—and the official name of the Church bears His name: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) We believe that Jesus Christ’s gospel was restored on earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who in 1829 translated the ancient scriptural texts by the gift of revelation from God. Like the ancient prophets who came before him, Joseph Smith served as God’s messenger and testified of Jesus Christ’s Atonement and of the Savior’s ability to change our lives for good.



The Book of Mormon is a fundamental part of Jesus Christ’s restored Church on the earth today.

God promises us that if we read the Book of Mormon with an open heart and mind, He will reveal to each of us its divinity and its truth through inspiration from the Holy Spirit. Some 80,000 Mormon missionaries are teaching people about this book on six continents in 107 languages—and these people are currently putting that promise to the test. Missionaries give out copies of the Book of Mormon for free, yet more than 15 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints count it among their most valuable possessions. Like these members, people from all over the world, from every possible background, are learning that the Book of Mormon can help us find peace and faith in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.

How can the Book of Mormon benefit my life?
Scriptures are more than just old words and stories. They are relevant, timely messages for the problems we face.

When you approach reading the Book of Mormon by frequently asking yourself, “What is this really saying?” you’ll find there are many relevant messages for you today. The book was written to inspire readers to make decisions that would ultimately improve their lives and bring them closer to God. It was the authors’ hope that their words would lead people to Jesus Christ and change behaviors; would lift sadness, uncertainty, and fear; would offer purpose and direction to people’s outlook on life; and would give people evidence that God is still “a God of miracles” (Mormon 9:10).The significance of the Book of Mormon in the world could be measured in the quantity of copies distributed or the overall increase in the number of people who choose to follow Jesus Christ after reading the book. The most important effect, however, is distinctly personal. The Book of Mormon answers questions, provides hope, and solidifies spiritual strength in people, one by one.The people whose lives have changed from reading the Book of Mormon found it when they were sinners or when they were faithful, when they felt hopeless or when they were happy. To find meaning in the Book of Mormon, people may be learned or uneducated, alone or surrounded by friends and family, financially successful or economically strained. The only common characteristic is that people who are affected by this book pick it up with a simple desire to know and understand its truth.
