HOUSTON, Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Juniper Capital II, L.P. ("Juniper") today announced a strategic partnership with BoomTown Oil LLC ("BoomTown") to pursue and develop conventional and unconventional oil and gas plays across multiple basins in the Lower 48, initially focusing on the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.








The principals of BoomTown boast a broad range of skills and expertise.  In addition to petrophysical and reservoir engineering experience acquired at both Shell E&P and Rosetta Resources, BoomTown's principals also gained significant transactional and operational expertise after founding South Texas Reservoir Alliance.  In prior organizations, members of BoomTown were instrumental in the identification and early entry into prospective plays such as the Woodford SCOOP, Niobrara, and Eagle Ford Shale.  The team's operational experience includes both conventional and unconventional settings across multiple Basins where they have acquired/leased in excess of 180,000 acres and drilled hundreds of horizontal wells.  
"BoomTown is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this oil downturn with its skillset and partnership with Juniper Capital," said Michael Rozenfeld, a Partner at BoomTown.  "BoomTown is pleased to have found such a synergistic partner with Juniper and plans to work in concert with them to achieve compelling returns for investors."
"From the beginning, it has been apparent that Juniper and BoomTown share common philosophies regarding strategy and execution.  We are pleased to partner with BoomTown, and we believe that BoomTown's creative sourcing and sound technical expertise will lead to quality investment opportunities for us to jointly pursue," said Juniper Partner Kevin Cumming.
BoomTown was advised by Wittliff | Cutter | Austin PLLC.  Juniper was advised by Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.
About BoomTown Oil LLCBased in Houston, BoomTown is an oil and gas exploration company focused on low cost, economic & technically sound operations.  BoomTown has previously operated in eight different states in both conventional and unconventional settings, and has leased or purchased over 180,000 acres and drilled hundreds of horizontal wells.  While initially focusing on the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, BoomTown will also consider acquisition and development opportunities in other basins in the Lower 48.  The company is led by Partners Michael Rozenfeld and Sean Fitzgerald.  For more information, please visit http://www.boomtownoil.com.

KEY ATTRIBUTES



































Key Differentiating Attributes

Seeks to fill void for North American upstream energy companies

High-quality teams with relatively less competition

Typically results in negotiated deals as opposed to auction



Unique Investment Focus

$650MM+ total equity capital invested across the upstream, midstream and oilfield services sectors since 2003

Involvement with 40 discrete private energy investments and 8 E&P operators backed since 2005
​
Works with both repeat and new management teams

ABOUT  


































About Juniper Capital





The senior members of the team, including Edward Geiser, Richard Gordon and Kevin Cumming, initially began working together over 15 years ago. They have over 65 years of collective energy experience and have been involved with over 40 distinct private investments in the North American energy industry with $650MM+ of private equity capital invested since 2003.

Juniper’s investment size fills a void in the energy market by targeting smaller investments than those targeted by larger energy-focused private equity funds and most strategic acquirers. Juniper’s target investment size of $25 to $75 million per investment is large enough to create significant value with high-quality management teams, but small enough to avoid “widely-shopped” investment opportunities.
​
The investment focus of Juniper is upstream E&P investments targeting established onshore basins in the US. Juniper partners with experienced operators with basin-specific expertise.

Juniper Capital II, L.P. and BoomTown Oil Announce Strategic Partnership






Nov 29, 2016, 10:44am EST














HOUSTON, Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Juniper Capital II, L.P. ("Juniper") today announced a strategic partnership with BoomTown Oil LLC ("BoomTown") to pursue and develop conventional and unconventional oil and gas plays across multiple basins in the Lower 48, initially focusing on the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.
The principals of BoomTown boast a broad range of skills and expertise.  In addition to petrophysical and reservoir engineering experience acquired at both Shell E&P and Rosetta Resources, BoomTown's principals also gained significant transactional and operational expertise after founding South Texas Reservoir Alliance.  In prior organizations, members of BoomTown were instrumental in the identification and early entry into prospective plays such as the Woodford SCOOP, Niobrara, and Eagle Ford Shale.  The team's operational experience includes both conventional and unconventional settings across multiple Basins where they have acquired/leased in excess of 180,000 acres and drilled hundreds of horizontal wells.  
"BoomTown is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this oil downturn with its skillset and partnership with Juniper Capital," said Michael Rozenfeld, a Partner at BoomTown.  "BoomTown is pleased to have found such a synergistic partner with Juniper and plans to work in concert with them to achieve compelling returns for investors."
"From the beginning, it has been apparent that Juniper and BoomTown share common philosophies regarding strategy and execution.  We are pleased to partner with BoomTown, and we believe that BoomTown's creative sourcing and sound technical expertise will lead to quality investment opportunities for us to jointly pursue," said Juniper Partner Kevin Cumming.
BoomTown was advised by Wittliff | Cutter | Austin PLLC.  Juniper was advised by Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.
