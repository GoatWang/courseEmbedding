FAQs

Performance










Can I order Gigabit Fiber Internet + Home Phone?





Please enter your address to check for service at your home. You can order service if it's available at your home now, or pre-order service if it will be available in the future.







When will Sonic bring fiber to my home?





Visit sonic.com/availability and input your address. Our system will let you know your home's expected service activation date and the option to pre-order service.







What's a pre-order?





Pre-ordering allows us to create your Sonic account now so we can call you to schedule an installation as soon as Gigabit Fiber Internet is available at your address. You will be first in line when fiber comes to your area. We'll also send you periodic update emails along the way.







Why do I have to give a credit card for a pre-order? Will I be charged now?





We take your credit card information as a way to finalize your Sonic account setup. We only charge your card for your first month of service ($40). That credit is applied to your account so that when we activate your address, you'll be ready to go! Your credit card won't be charged again until your second month of service begins.







How can I figure out which neighborhood I'm in?





Instead of associating your address to a neighborhood, we now offer more accurate expected activation dates for each individual home. Please enter your address on our Check Availability page to get an estimated service activation date for your house











Does Gigabit Fiber Internet + Home Phone require a contract?





All Sonic services require a 12-month contract. Cancellations after 30 days of service will be subject to an early termination fee.







What if I am in a contract? Can I still sign up for Gigabit Internet + Phone?





Yes! We will buy out existing contract early termination fees up to $200 from another ISP, for Gigabit Fiber Internet customers only. Please see our full policy here.







Are there TV bundles available?





Yes! Get $10 off your bill for 12 months when you sign up for DISH through Sonic. Click here to learn more.







What if I already have DISH service?





You can continue with your existing DISH service and still sign up for Sonic Gigabit Internet + Home Phone.











How long does a typical installation take?





Please allow up to 4 hours for your installation. Installation time will depend on the current state of home Ethernet and telephone jacks. Sonic will give its best effort to connect a single jack for the standard install, free of charge. This installation is perfect for nearly all of our Gigabit Fiber Internet customers.
To upgrade to our Whole Home Ethernet installation option, there is a $200 one-time fee. Our installer will activate up to 7 jacks to ensure the highest-speed connectivity in every corner of your home!

What equipment will I need?





Please see our product equipment page for Gigabit Fiber Internet.







Can I use my own equipment?





Absolutely, but we can't guarantee your service speed or quality with an unsupported device. We recommend trying out our equipment rental program. It's backed by our award-winning support team who is available seven days a week to answer any questions you may have and troubleshoot to find solutions. And, we'll replace the router/modem if it ever fails. If you decide to opt out of our rental program your equipment will not be supported by our team.







Is Sonic's Gigabit Fiber Internet + Home Phone service compatible with my existing home security service?





Most home security systems are compatible with Sonic's Gigabit Fiber connection. Call your home security provider for more details.







On Sonic's Gigabit Fiber service, can I get any Static IPs?





No, we do not offer Static IPs on our Gigabit Fiber service at this time.











Is there a maximum monthly data usage cap on the Gigabit Fiber + Phone plan?





Nope. We don't believe in data caps!







How do I get the most out of my Gigabit Fiber Internet connection?





To optimize your Gigabit connection, make sure your PC is Gigabit compatible. Wired connections always perform better than WiFi connections, so keep your PC directly plugged in using Ethernet whenever possible.
You will not see the full speed of your fiber connection on WiFi. Wireless speeds will vary based on your device's wireless path to the Residential Gateway (RG) and the capability of your specific device. Please check with your manufacturer to see what speeds you can expect over wireless.







What is my WiFi SSID and password?





Your WiFi SSID and password are printed on the side of your RG.







I'm having trouble with my Internet connection. How do I troubleshoot?





Follow these steps to get your Gigabit Internet back up and running.
Restart your computer/tablet/mobile phone
Unplug your Residential Gateway (RG)'s power supply from the wall for several seconds before powering it back up. Wait 5 minutes for it to re-establish its connection.
If you're still having trouble, contact customer care. We're open 7 days a week from 8 AM - 10 PM.

At the end of 2016, Mediacom announced it would become the first major U.S. cable company to fully transition to the DOCSIS 3.1 platform, a new generation of broadband technology.[6] In January 2017, Mediacom launched 1 Gbps internet service across its entire Iowa footprint and as a result, all of the nearly 1 million households in the more than 300 Iowa communities passed by Mediacom’s Iowa network now have access to download speeds that are up to 40 times faster than the minimum broadband definition set by the FCC.[7] According to Mediacom’s website, 1 Gbps internet service is also available in portions of Alabama and Missouri, and, by the end of 2017, will be made available to every single community where Mediacom offers internet service.[8]
Sports[edit]
Mediacom broadcasts local sports programming on its Connections channel, MC22, along with a simulcast of ESPNEWS. Other sports channels on the Mediacom lineup as of September 2015 include NFL Network, Big Ten Network, SEC Network and the national feed of the YES Network. Mediacom does not carry NHL Network, MLB Network or NBA TV or Tennis Channel.
Reputation[edit]
In 2016 Mediacom Communications was named the Nations Top Communications Provider by the leading industry publication CableFax. [9]
In a 2016 telecom report conducted by ACSI, Mediacom occupied last place in customer satisfaction among all companies in the ACSI, regardless of industry.[10]
In a survey conducted by Consumer Reports magazine in 2012, Mediacom is the worst cable provider in the country according to the 50,000 people polled.[11]
The September 28, 2012 edition of PC Magazine named Mediacom one of the nation’s worst 15 fastest internet service providers.[12]
The Des Moines Business Record in its 2012 Best of Des Moines issue gave Mediacom the top award for Best Local Internet Service Provider and Best Company Use of Social Media.[13]
As reported in the Chicago Tribune, July 19, 2012, in July 2012, Mediacom was named by the FCC as one of the nation’s top 4 Internet service providers when it comes to delivering advertised speeds to consumers.[14]
The February 2010 issue of Consumer Reports ranked Mediacom amongst the worst cable companies in the United States: 15th of 16 in TV service, 24th of 27 in Internet service, and last of 23 in phone service, based on surveys.[15][16] The deepening of this trend was affirmed in the June 2012 issue of Consumer Reports, in which Mediacom was identified as the worst-rated company in the United States regarding TV service, phone service and bundled telecom services, and the third worst ISP only above the two satellite internet companies Wild Blue and Hughes Net.[17]
Carriage disputes involving Mediacom[edit]
June 2015 carriage dispute with Granite Broadcasting[edit]
On June 1, 2015, Mediacom subscribers in three television markets served by Granite Broadcasting Corporation stations were unable to view those stations over Mediacom cable due to a carriage dispute between Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting over retransmission consent fees. The affected Granite Broadcasting stations included WEEK-TV in Peoria, Illinois, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin/Duluth, Minnesota, and WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana, all three of which are primary NBC affiliates.[18] On June 11, 2015, Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting reached an agreement, thereby restoring Granite stations to Mediacom cable systems. The agreement came just in time for Game 5 of the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals which was broadcast on NBC two days later.[19]
July 2015 carriage dispute with Media General[edit]
On July 14, 2015, Media General pulled its stations off of Mediacom cable systems across the United States due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent fees.[20] This carriage dispute saw Media General stations disappear from Mediacom lineups in 14 television markets across the United States and even three of the Fox affiliates owned by Media General were lost to Mediacom subscribers in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Topeka, Kansas just before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[21] On July 30, 2015, Mediacom and Media General reached a new agreement, thereby restoring Media General owned stations to Mediacom subscribers in the affected areas.[22]
Mediacom views on carriage disputes and retransmission blackouts[edit]
On July 7, 2015, Mediacom filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to limit or prevent blackouts of local broadcast stations during carriage disputes. According to Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso, the FCC has frequently neglected to address concerns regarding retransmission consent and blackouts of local television stations, particularly in rural areas, where residents have a more difficult time receiving an acceptable over-the-air signal. Commisso's proposal was for local broadcasters not to terminate a cable or satellite provider's carriage of the station's signal at the end of a retransmission consent agreement if the station does not reach a minimum of 90 percent of its local viewers within its DMA either over-the-air or via its online stream. Commisso also made note of the fact that retransmission consent fees double every two or three years; something which never happens in any other industry.[23]

Coverage[edit]
Mediacom offers service in 14 states.[3] About 55% of Mediacom's subscription base is in the 60th through 100th ranked television markets. It is the largest cable company in Iowa and second largest in Illinois.[1]
Examples of cities with Mediacom service include Albany, Columbus, Tifton and Valdosta in Georgia; Iowa City, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines in Iowa; Columbia, Jefferson City and Springfield in Missouri and the Quad Cities on the Iowa/Illinois border. Mediacom also serves outlying areas on the Florida Gulf Coast and around Minneapolis, Minnesota.[1]:7
In reporting its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, Mediacom describes itself as the 5th largest U.S. cable company, with 1,352,000 customer relationships at the end of 2016. [4] In February 2017, Multichannel News reported that Mediacom was the 9th largest multichannel video programming distributor in the U.S. with 828,000 video customers.[5] Of 2,800,000 "homes passed" (places where Mediacom service can be ordered), 44% of have subscribed to basic cable with Mediacom, and 27.8% have subscribed to Mediacom Internet service. Of homes with basic cable, 54.8% also have "digital cable" service. Counting basic cable, digital cable, high-speed data, and cable telephony as separate revenue, Mediacom had 2,981,000 revenue generating units (RGUs) at the end of 2009.[1]:6 52% of customers had at least two of video, Internet, and phone from Mediacom, and 18% had all three; over the previous five years, video decreased from 80% of Mediacom's revenue to 64%.[1]:7
At the end of 2016, Mediacom announced it would become the first major U.S. cable company to fully transition to the DOCSIS 3.1 platform, a new generation of broadband technology.[6] In January 2017, Mediacom launched 1 Gbps internet service across its entire Iowa footprint and as a result, all of the nearly 1 million households in the more than 300 Iowa communities passed by Mediacom’s Iowa network now have access to download speeds that are up to 40 times faster than the minimum broadband definition set by the FCC.[7] According to Mediacom’s website, 1 Gbps internet service is also available in portions of Alabama and Missouri, and, by the end of 2017, will be made available to every single community where Mediacom offers internet service.[8]
Sports[edit]
Mediacom broadcasts local sports programming on its Connections channel, MC22, along with a simulcast of ESPNEWS. Other sports channels on the Mediacom lineup as of September 2015 include NFL Network, Big Ten Network, SEC Network and the national feed of the YES Network. Mediacom does not carry NHL Network, MLB Network or NBA TV or Tennis Channel.
Reputation[edit]
In 2016 Mediacom Communications was named the Nations Top Communications Provider by the leading industry publication CableFax. [9]
In a 2016 telecom report conducted by ACSI, Mediacom occupied last place in customer satisfaction among all companies in the ACSI, regardless of industry.[10]
In a survey conducted by Consumer Reports magazine in 2012, Mediacom is the worst cable provider in the country according to the 50,000 people polled.[11]
The September 28, 2012 edition of PC Magazine named Mediacom one of the nation’s worst 15 fastest internet service providers.[12]
The Des Moines Business Record in its 2012 Best of Des Moines issue gave Mediacom the top award for Best Local Internet Service Provider and Best Company Use of Social Media.[13]
As reported in the Chicago Tribune, July 19, 2012, in July 2012, Mediacom was named by the FCC as one of the nation’s top 4 Internet service providers when it comes to delivering advertised speeds to consumers.[14]
The February 2010 issue of Consumer Reports ranked Mediacom amongst the worst cable companies in the United States: 15th of 16 in TV service, 24th of 27 in Internet service, and last of 23 in phone service, based on surveys.[15][16] The deepening of this trend was affirmed in the June 2012 issue of Consumer Reports, in which Mediacom was identified as the worst-rated company in the United States regarding TV service, phone service and bundled telecom services, and the third worst ISP only above the two satellite internet companies Wild Blue and Hughes Net.[17]
Carriage disputes involving Mediacom[edit]
June 2015 carriage dispute with Granite Broadcasting[edit]
On June 1, 2015, Mediacom subscribers in three television markets served by Granite Broadcasting Corporation stations were unable to view those stations over Mediacom cable due to a carriage dispute between Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting over retransmission consent fees. The affected Granite Broadcasting stations included WEEK-TV in Peoria, Illinois, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin/Duluth, Minnesota, and WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana, all three of which are primary NBC affiliates.[18] On June 11, 2015, Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting reached an agreement, thereby restoring Granite stations to Mediacom cable systems. The agreement came just in time for Game 5 of the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals which was broadcast on NBC two days later.[19]
July 2015 carriage dispute with Media General[edit]
On July 14, 2015, Media General pulled its stations off of Mediacom cable systems across the United States due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent fees.[20] This carriage dispute saw Media General stations disappear from Mediacom lineups in 14 television markets across the United States and even three of the Fox affiliates owned by Media General were lost to Mediacom subscribers in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Topeka, Kansas just before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[21] On July 30, 2015, Mediacom and Media General reached a new agreement, thereby restoring Media General owned stations to Mediacom subscribers in the affected areas.[22]
Mediacom views on carriage disputes and retransmission blackouts[edit]
On July 7, 2015, Mediacom filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to limit or prevent blackouts of local broadcast stations during carriage disputes. According to Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso, the FCC has frequently neglected to address concerns regarding retransmission consent and blackouts of local television stations, particularly in rural areas, where residents have a more difficult time receiving an acceptable over-the-air signal. Commisso's proposal was for local broadcasters not to terminate a cable or satellite provider's carriage of the station's signal at the end of a retransmission consent agreement if the station does not reach a minimum of 90 percent of its local viewers within its DMA either over-the-air or via its online stream. Commisso also made note of the fact that retransmission consent fees double every two or three years; something which never happens in any other industry.[23]

Coverage[edit]
Mediacom offers service in 14 states.[3] About 55% of Mediacom's subscription base is in the 60th through 100th ranked television markets. It is the largest cable company in Iowa and second largest in Illinois.[1]
Examples of cities with Mediacom service include Albany, Columbus, Tifton and Valdosta in Georgia; Iowa City, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines in Iowa; Columbia, Jefferson City and Springfield in Missouri and the Quad Cities on the Iowa/Illinois border. Mediacom also serves outlying areas on the Florida Gulf Coast and around Minneapolis, Minnesota.[1]:7
In reporting its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, Mediacom describes itself as the 5th largest U.S. cable company, with 1,352,000 customer relationships at the end of 2016. [4] In February 2017, Multichannel News reported that Mediacom was the 9th largest multichannel video programming distributor in the U.S. with 828,000 video customers.[5] Of 2,800,000 "homes passed" (places where Mediacom service can be ordered), 44% of have subscribed to basic cable with Mediacom, and 27.8% have subscribed to Mediacom Internet service. Of homes with basic cable, 54.8% also have "digital cable" service. Counting basic cable, digital cable, high-speed data, and cable telephony as separate revenue, Mediacom had 2,981,000 revenue generating units (RGUs) at the end of 2009.[1]:6 52% of customers had at least two of video, Internet, and phone from Mediacom, and 18% had all three; over the previous five years, video decreased from 80% of Mediacom's revenue to 64%.[1]:7
At the end of 2016, Mediacom announced it would become the first major U.S. cable company to fully transition to the DOCSIS 3.1 platform, a new generation of broadband technology.[6] In January 2017, Mediacom launched 1 Gbps internet service across its entire Iowa footprint and as a result, all of the nearly 1 million households in the more than 300 Iowa communities passed by Mediacom’s Iowa network now have access to download speeds that are up to 40 times faster than the minimum broadband definition set by the FCC.[7] According to Mediacom’s website, 1 Gbps internet service is also available in portions of Alabama and Missouri, and, by the end of 2017, will be made available to every single community where Mediacom offers internet service.[8]
Sports[edit]
Mediacom broadcasts local sports programming on its Connections channel, MC22, along with a simulcast of ESPNEWS. Other sports channels on the Mediacom lineup as of September 2015 include NFL Network, Big Ten Network, SEC Network and the national feed of the YES Network. Mediacom does not carry NHL Network, MLB Network or NBA TV or Tennis Channel.
Reputation[edit]
In 2016 Mediacom Communications was named the Nations Top Communications Provider by the leading industry publication CableFax. [9]
In a 2016 telecom report conducted by ACSI, Mediacom occupied last place in customer satisfaction among all companies in the ACSI, regardless of industry.[10]
In a survey conducted by Consumer Reports magazine in 2012, Mediacom is the worst cable provider in the country according to the 50,000 people polled.[11]
The September 28, 2012 edition of PC Magazine named Mediacom one of the nation’s worst 15 fastest internet service providers.[12]
The Des Moines Business Record in its 2012 Best of Des Moines issue gave Mediacom the top award for Best Local Internet Service Provider and Best Company Use of Social Media.[13]
As reported in the Chicago Tribune, July 19, 2012, in July 2012, Mediacom was named by the FCC as one of the nation’s top 4 Internet service providers when it comes to delivering advertised speeds to consumers.[14]
The February 2010 issue of Consumer Reports ranked Mediacom amongst the worst cable companies in the United States: 15th of 16 in TV service, 24th of 27 in Internet service, and last of 23 in phone service, based on surveys.[15][16] The deepening of this trend was affirmed in the June 2012 issue of Consumer Reports, in which Mediacom was identified as the worst-rated company in the United States regarding TV service, phone service and bundled telecom services, and the third worst ISP only above the two satellite internet companies Wild Blue and Hughes Net.[17]
Carriage disputes involving Mediacom[edit]
June 2015 carriage dispute with Granite Broadcasting[edit]
On June 1, 2015, Mediacom subscribers in three television markets served by Granite Broadcasting Corporation stations were unable to view those stations over Mediacom cable due to a carriage dispute between Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting over retransmission consent fees. The affected Granite Broadcasting stations included WEEK-TV in Peoria, Illinois, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin/Duluth, Minnesota, and WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana, all three of which are primary NBC affiliates.[18] On June 11, 2015, Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting reached an agreement, thereby restoring Granite stations to Mediacom cable systems. The agreement came just in time for Game 5 of the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals which was broadcast on NBC two days later.[19]
July 2015 carriage dispute with Media General[edit]
On July 14, 2015, Media General pulled its stations off of Mediacom cable systems across the United States due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent fees.[20] This carriage dispute saw Media General stations disappear from Mediacom lineups in 14 television markets across the United States and even three of the Fox affiliates owned by Media General were lost to Mediacom subscribers in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Topeka, Kansas just before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[21] On July 30, 2015, Mediacom and Media General reached a new agreement, thereby restoring Media General owned stations to Mediacom subscribers in the affected areas.[22]
Mediacom views on carriage disputes and retransmission blackouts[edit]
On July 7, 2015, Mediacom filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to limit or prevent blackouts of local broadcast stations during carriage disputes. According to Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso, the FCC has frequently neglected to address concerns regarding retransmission consent and blackouts of local television stations, particularly in rural areas, where residents have a more difficult time receiving an acceptable over-the-air signal. Commisso's proposal was for local broadcasters not to terminate a cable or satellite provider's carriage of the station's signal at the end of a retransmission consent agreement if the station does not reach a minimum of 90 percent of its local viewers within its DMA either over-the-air or via its online stream. Commisso also made note of the fact that retransmission consent fees double every two or three years; something which never happens in any other industry.[23]

At the end of 2016, Mediacom announced it would become the first major U.S. cable company to fully transition to the DOCSIS 3.1 platform, a new generation of broadband technology.[6] In January 2017, Mediacom launched 1 Gbps internet service across its entire Iowa footprint and as a result, all of the nearly 1 million households in the more than 300 Iowa communities passed by Mediacom’s Iowa network now have access to download speeds that are up to 40 times faster than the minimum broadband definition set by the FCC.[7] According to Mediacom’s website, 1 Gbps internet service is also available in portions of Alabama and Missouri, and, by the end of 2017, will be made available to every single community where Mediacom offers internet service.[8]

The September 28, 2012 edition of PC Magazine named Mediacom one of the nation’s worst 15 fastest internet service providers.[12]
The Des Moines Business Record in its 2012 Best of Des Moines issue gave Mediacom the top award for Best Local Internet Service Provider and Best Company Use of Social Media.[13]

The February 2010 issue of Consumer Reports ranked Mediacom amongst the worst cable companies in the United States: 15th of 16 in TV service, 24th of 27 in Internet service, and last of 23 in phone service, based on surveys.[15][16] The deepening of this trend was affirmed in the June 2012 issue of Consumer Reports, in which Mediacom was identified as the worst-rated company in the United States regarding TV service, phone service and bundled telecom services, and the third worst ISP only above the two satellite internet companies Wild Blue and Hughes Net.[17]
Carriage disputes involving Mediacom[edit]
June 2015 carriage dispute with Granite Broadcasting[edit]
On June 1, 2015, Mediacom subscribers in three television markets served by Granite Broadcasting Corporation stations were unable to view those stations over Mediacom cable due to a carriage dispute between Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting over retransmission consent fees. The affected Granite Broadcasting stations included WEEK-TV in Peoria, Illinois, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin/Duluth, Minnesota, and WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana, all three of which are primary NBC affiliates.[18] On June 11, 2015, Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting reached an agreement, thereby restoring Granite stations to Mediacom cable systems. The agreement came just in time for Game 5 of the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals which was broadcast on NBC two days later.[19]
July 2015 carriage dispute with Media General[edit]
On July 14, 2015, Media General pulled its stations off of Mediacom cable systems across the United States due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent fees.[20] This carriage dispute saw Media General stations disappear from Mediacom lineups in 14 television markets across the United States and even three of the Fox affiliates owned by Media General were lost to Mediacom subscribers in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Topeka, Kansas just before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[21] On July 30, 2015, Mediacom and Media General reached a new agreement, thereby restoring Media General owned stations to Mediacom subscribers in the affected areas.[22]
Mediacom views on carriage disputes and retransmission blackouts[edit]
On July 7, 2015, Mediacom filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to limit or prevent blackouts of local broadcast stations during carriage disputes. According to Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso, the FCC has frequently neglected to address concerns regarding retransmission consent and blackouts of local television stations, particularly in rural areas, where residents have a more difficult time receiving an acceptable over-the-air signal. Commisso's proposal was for local broadcasters not to terminate a cable or satellite provider's carriage of the station's signal at the end of a retransmission consent agreement if the station does not reach a minimum of 90 percent of its local viewers within its DMA either over-the-air or via its online stream. Commisso also made note of the fact that retransmission consent fees double every two or three years; something which never happens in any other industry.[23]

Coverage[edit]
Mediacom offers service in 14 states.[3] About 55% of Mediacom's subscription base is in the 60th through 100th ranked television markets. It is the largest cable company in Iowa and second largest in Illinois.[1]
Examples of cities with Mediacom service include Albany, Columbus, Tifton and Valdosta in Georgia; Iowa City, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines in Iowa; Columbia, Jefferson City and Springfield in Missouri and the Quad Cities on the Iowa/Illinois border. Mediacom also serves outlying areas on the Florida Gulf Coast and around Minneapolis, Minnesota.[1]:7
In reporting its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, Mediacom describes itself as the 5th largest U.S. cable company, with 1,352,000 customer relationships at the end of 2016. [4] In February 2017, Multichannel News reported that Mediacom was the 9th largest multichannel video programming distributor in the U.S. with 828,000 video customers.[5] Of 2,800,000 "homes passed" (places where Mediacom service can be ordered), 44% of have subscribed to basic cable with Mediacom, and 27.8% have subscribed to Mediacom Internet service. Of homes with basic cable, 54.8% also have "digital cable" service. Counting basic cable, digital cable, high-speed data, and cable telephony as separate revenue, Mediacom had 2,981,000 revenue generating units (RGUs) at the end of 2009.[1]:6 52% of customers had at least two of video, Internet, and phone from Mediacom, and 18% had all three; over the previous five years, video decreased from 80% of Mediacom's revenue to 64%.[1]:7
At the end of 2016, Mediacom announced it would become the first major U.S. cable company to fully transition to the DOCSIS 3.1 platform, a new generation of broadband technology.[6] In January 2017, Mediacom launched 1 Gbps internet service across its entire Iowa footprint and as a result, all of the nearly 1 million households in the more than 300 Iowa communities passed by Mediacom’s Iowa network now have access to download speeds that are up to 40 times faster than the minimum broadband definition set by the FCC.[7] According to Mediacom’s website, 1 Gbps internet service is also available in portions of Alabama and Missouri, and, by the end of 2017, will be made available to every single community where Mediacom offers internet service.[8]
Sports[edit]
Mediacom broadcasts local sports programming on its Connections channel, MC22, along with a simulcast of ESPNEWS. Other sports channels on the Mediacom lineup as of September 2015 include NFL Network, Big Ten Network, SEC Network and the national feed of the YES Network. Mediacom does not carry NHL Network, MLB Network or NBA TV or Tennis Channel.
Reputation[edit]
In 2016 Mediacom Communications was named the Nations Top Communications Provider by the leading industry publication CableFax. [9]
In a 2016 telecom report conducted by ACSI, Mediacom occupied last place in customer satisfaction among all companies in the ACSI, regardless of industry.[10]
In a survey conducted by Consumer Reports magazine in 2012, Mediacom is the worst cable provider in the country according to the 50,000 people polled.[11]
The September 28, 2012 edition of PC Magazine named Mediacom one of the nation’s worst 15 fastest internet service providers.[12]
The Des Moines Business Record in its 2012 Best of Des Moines issue gave Mediacom the top award for Best Local Internet Service Provider and Best Company Use of Social Media.[13]
As reported in the Chicago Tribune, July 19, 2012, in July 2012, Mediacom was named by the FCC as one of the nation’s top 4 Internet service providers when it comes to delivering advertised speeds to consumers.[14]
The February 2010 issue of Consumer Reports ranked Mediacom amongst the worst cable companies in the United States: 15th of 16 in TV service, 24th of 27 in Internet service, and last of 23 in phone service, based on surveys.[15][16] The deepening of this trend was affirmed in the June 2012 issue of Consumer Reports, in which Mediacom was identified as the worst-rated company in the United States regarding TV service, phone service and bundled telecom services, and the third worst ISP only above the two satellite internet companies Wild Blue and Hughes Net.[17]
Carriage disputes involving Mediacom[edit]
June 2015 carriage dispute with Granite Broadcasting[edit]
On June 1, 2015, Mediacom subscribers in three television markets served by Granite Broadcasting Corporation stations were unable to view those stations over Mediacom cable due to a carriage dispute between Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting over retransmission consent fees. The affected Granite Broadcasting stations included WEEK-TV in Peoria, Illinois, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin/Duluth, Minnesota, and WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana, all three of which are primary NBC affiliates.[18] On June 11, 2015, Mediacom and Granite Broadcasting reached an agreement, thereby restoring Granite stations to Mediacom cable systems. The agreement came just in time for Game 5 of the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals which was broadcast on NBC two days later.[19]
July 2015 carriage dispute with Media General[edit]
On July 14, 2015, Media General pulled its stations off of Mediacom cable systems across the United States due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent fees.[20] This carriage dispute saw Media General stations disappear from Mediacom lineups in 14 television markets across the United States and even three of the Fox affiliates owned by Media General were lost to Mediacom subscribers in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Topeka, Kansas just before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[21] On July 30, 2015, Mediacom and Media General reached a new agreement, thereby restoring Media General owned stations to Mediacom subscribers in the affected areas.[22]
Mediacom views on carriage disputes and retransmission blackouts[edit]
On July 7, 2015, Mediacom filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to limit or prevent blackouts of local broadcast stations during carriage disputes. According to Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso, the FCC has frequently neglected to address concerns regarding retransmission consent and blackouts of local television stations, particularly in rural areas, where residents have a more difficult time receiving an acceptable over-the-air signal. Commisso's proposal was for local broadcasters not to terminate a cable or satellite provider's carriage of the station's signal at the end of a retransmission consent agreement if the station does not reach a minimum of 90 percent of its local viewers within its DMA either over-the-air or via its online stream. Commisso also made note of the fact that retransmission consent fees double every two or three years; something which never happens in any other industry.[23]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
