JONES, William Carey - Encyclopedia Dubuque


















Encyclopedia
Dubuque
www.encyclopediadubuque.org
"Encyclopedia Dubuque is the online authority for all things Dubuque, written by the people who know the city best.”Marshall Cohen—researcher and producer, CNN

JONES, William Carey

From Encyclopedia Dubuque

Jump to: navigation, search

JONES, William Carey. (eastern United States--San Francisco, California, 1867). In 1835 Jones had learned the art of printing and had acquired enough education that he wished to move West. His wishes came true when he met in Chillicothe, Ohio John King who had traveled east to purchase equipment to print a newspaper in Dubuque. (1) King hired Jones to be the foreman of the newspaper in return for $350, fifty dollars to be paid immediately and the rest as requested. He also promised Jones board and lodging for one year. (2)
Jones accompanied King to Cincinnati, Ohio to purchase the needed press and type.  The two men and the equipment then returned to Dubuque where the first issue of the DUBUQUE VISITOR was published. To work with Jones, King hired Andrew KEESECKER of Galena. Keesecker served as an editor while Jones wrote articles and set the type. (3)
Jones, a whig in political temperament, soon decided that the neutral "Visitor" was not his ideal workplace. He left for New Orleans where his talents made the paper so profitable that he was soon able to retire. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he made the acquaintance of Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. He married one of the senator's daughters. It was Senator Benton who suggested that Jones' study of law would benefit from his mastery of Spanish and a practice in San Francisco. (4)
After determining the potential of San Francisco, he returned east to gather his family, his mother and a sister and brother. They returned to San Francisco where Jones was involved in nearly all the land claims occupying the California courts. His legal practice was so successful that at one time he was said to be worth half a million dollars. (5)

            In the name of great taste, we promise to never cut corners.

We use only the finest quality ingredients in every product we make—from our all-natural, Certified Gluten-Free sausages to our naturally smoked, dry aged bacon. We never compromise, so you don’t have to either.











                Breakfast Sausage
            

                Even as we add new varieties like all-natural chicken sausage to the mix, we’ve always stayed true to our family’s 128-year-old breakfast sausage recipe. Today, all of our Certified Gluten-Free sausages are still made with absolutely no binders, fillers or MSG.

                Dry Aged Bacon and Canadian Bacon
            

                We are firm believers in the “everything’s better with bacon” mantra. For the most authentic flavor, we use a one-of-a-kind dry aging method. It takes more time, but we think you’ll agree our naturally smoked, gluten-free bacon is worth the wait. And for Canadian Bacon lovers, our hickory smoked variety is the top-seller in the U.S.

                Hickory Smoked Ham
            

                Whether you’re celebrating with friends or preparing a casual dinner for two, you can’t go wrong with Certified Gluten-Free, hickory smoked ham. To ensure the highest quality, our hams are always fresh—never frozen.

                Specialty Products
            

                Our specialty products—including liver sausage and scrapple—are like cult classic movies. Before you give them a shot, they may seem like they’re not your style. But once you dive in? You’ll be hooked.
