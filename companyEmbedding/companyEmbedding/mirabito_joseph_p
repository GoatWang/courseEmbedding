Mirabito Energy Products CEO Joseph P. Mirabito Named 2015 STOP-DWI MADD Award Recipient

April 29, 2015Brent Strignano 




(Binghamton, NY) The Broome County STOP-DWI Program today announced that Mirabito Energy
Products CEO Joseph P. Mirabito has been awarded the 2015 NYS STOP-DWI Foundation and Mothers
Against Drunk Driving New York State (MADD) Non-Law Enforcement Award for his support of
young driver education held in conjunction with the Mirabito STOP-DWI Holiday Classic.
 
“Mr. Mirabito and Mirabito Energy Products have gone above and beyond in every way possible in their
support of young driver education provided by the Broome County STOP-DWI Program,” said Broome
County Executive Debbie Preston. “Without the support of Mr. Mirabito and the entire Mirabito Energy
Products team, the Broome County STOP-DWI Program would not be able to conduct the amount of
young driver education that it currently does on a yearly basis. The support given to this program has no
doubt had an immediate and long-lasting impact on the mindset of our young drivers and will save lives
for many years to come.”
 
By partnering with Mirabito Energy Products, the STOP-DWI Program has been able to expand its
young driver education program to include the following:
 

Conducting 79 impaired-driving presentations to 4,284 students in 20 schools districts around the Southern Tier over the past 3 years
Hosting a 5-hour traffic safety seminar for over 300 student athletes participating in the STOPDWI Holiday Classic basketball tournament on an annual basis
Co-hosting Teen Traffic Safety Day at which over 1,300 students from 16 school districts come together for a full day of interactive activities, guest speakers, and traffic safety competitions
Partnering with local school districts to provide a law enforcement presence at high-profile high school events to deter and detect alcohol use amongst students
Working with Mirabito convenience stores to reduce underage drinking

 
Since 1995, New York State highway safety partners have proudly hosted this annual recognition to
acknowledge outstanding efforts and achievements in deterring impaired driving. This recognition
program is supported by member agencies of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee, the NYS STOPDWI
Foundation and MADD.

Mirabito Acquiring 31 C-Stores From Global PartnersSites are part of nonstrategic divestment from Warren Equities purchase

Mergers, Acquisition & Growth>

Mergers & Acquisitions News










May 26, 2016BINGHAMTON, N.Y. -- Mirabito Holdings Inc. has entered into an agreement with Global Partners LP to acquire 31 gas stations and convenience stores, 26 in New York and five in Pennsylvania, from Global Partners.“We continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our brand,” said Joseph P. Mirabito, president and CEO of the Mirabito Family of Cos. “This acquisition reinforces our current footprint while allowing us new opportunities. We’re extremely grateful to all our associates who continue to make a difference to our customers and we look forward to serving in these new locations, shortly.”Global Partners is divesting a group of “nonstrategic” sites it acquired in January 2015 in connection with the
purchase of Warren Equities Inc. That deal included 147 company-operated Xtra Mart convenience stores and related fuel operations, 53 commission agent locations and fuel supply rights for about 320 dealers located in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.“The sale of these nonstrategic sites reflects our ongoing strategy to streamline our retail portfolio and optimize our assets,” said Eric Slifka, president and CEO of Global Partners. “This transaction, together with our previously announced plan to sell nonstrategic retail locations in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic through NRC Realty & Capital Advisors, is part of the approximately
125-site strategic divestiture program we outlined to investors earlier this year.”As reported in a McLane Co./CSP Daily News Flash, in addition to the transaction for the 31 sites, Global Partners and Mirabito will enter into long-term supply contracts for branded and unbranded gasoline and other petroleum products.The companies said they expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2016, subject to customary due diligence.Waltham, Mass.-based Global Partners is a midstream logistics and marketing company that owns, controls or has access to one of the largest terminal networks of petroleum products and renewable fuels in the Northeast. It also is one of the largest distributors of gasoline, distillates, residual oil and renewable fuels to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in New England and New York. The company is engaged in the transportation of crude oil and other products by rail from the midcontinental United States and Canada to the East and West coasts for distribution to refiners and others. With approximately 1,500 locations, primarily in the Northeast, Global Partners is one of the largest independent owners, suppliers and operators of gas stations and convenience stores.The Mirabito Family of Cos. operates in eight states with multiple divisions, including natural gas and electric, home energy products and services, wholesale energy products and services, convenience stores and truck repair. The Binghampton, N.Y.-based company operates approximately 75 convenience stores under the Mirabito, Quickway Food Stores, Convenience Express and Manley’s Mighty-Mart names.Related Topics:

Mirabito Acquires Manley’s Mighty Marts
Company will now have 74 c-stores throughout central New York.

April 25, 2014, 04:35 pm



 



BINGHAMTON, N.Y. -- The Mirabito Family of Cos. acquired Manley's Mighty Mart LLC and its network of 17 convenience stores. The Manley's stores are located in the upstate New York towns of Binghamton, Endicott, Endwell, Vestal, Johnson City, Windsor, Ithaca and Glen Aubrey.
“We’re pleased that Tony Manley has accepted our offer to purchase his locations,” said Mirabito CEO Joseph P. Mirabito. “[He] grew his business much like our family grew ours, through hard work and dedication both to customers and community.”

According to Mirabito, the transition process will begin on April 28. Initially, the stores will operate independently, hence keeping all current programs and offerings in place. Mirabito has alerted customers that the changeover "should be seamless" and they can expect "outstanding service throughout the process."
The Mirabito Family of Cos., based in Binghamton, operated 57 convenience stores prior to this transaction under the Mirabito Convenience Stores, Convenience Express and Quickway Food Store brand names throughout central New York.

More Mirabito C-stores to Add Tim Hortons
The move is part of a massive growth effort for Tim Hortons in the Empire State and beyond.

August 25, 2011, 08:00 pm



BINGHAMTON, N.Y. -- Upstate New York will soon get to know its neighbor to the north even better. The Mirabito Family of Cos., based here, reported that Tim Hortons, one of Canada's largest quick-service restaurant chains, will bring its Café & Bake Shop to 33 more of its convenience stores, according to a WIVT-TV report.
The move continues an aggressive growth plan by Tim Hortons in the United States. As CSNews Online reported last year, the company said it will open 300 stores by the end of 2013. New York State has already seen an infusion of Tim Hortons recently, with stores already popping up at other Mirabito stores in the Binghamton and Syracuse areas.
"Serving Tim Hortons coffee and baked goods in our stores further demonstrates Mirabito's commitment to providing our customers with quality, convenience and value," Joseph P. Mirabito, CEO of Mirabito, Quickway and Convenience Express stores and Mirabito Energy products, told the television station.
"Tim Hortons is the coffee of choice in western New York," said Mike Meilleur, Tim Hortons senior vice president of U.S. operations. "The partnership with Mirabito is another example of how Tim Hortons Café & Bake Shop is aggressively growing in the U.S."
With its aggressive expansion pace, Tim Hortons now has about 3,600 North American locations, including 600 in the United States.

Mirabito to Receive 2010 Carl Tripi AwardQuickway president honored by New York Association of Convenience Stores









April 28, 2010
ALBANY, N.Y. -- Joseph P. Mirabito, president of Quickway Food Stores, Convenience Express and Mirabito Energy Products, Binghamton, N.Y., has been named the recipient of the 2010 Carl Tripi Award by the New York Association of Convenience Stores (NYACS).

The honor is named for the late Carl Tripi of Tripifoods Inc., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based wholesale distributor that supplies convenience stores throughout New York and neighboring states.

"Carl himself remained behind the scenes, but he always made sure NYACS had the financial resources and volunteer support it needed [image-nocss] to meet any challenge and keep moving forward," said NYACS president James Calvin. "The award recognizes individuals who emulate that same low-profile, high-impact style of supporting the c-store industry. The combination of commitment, generosity and humility that made Carl Tripi so special is also Joe Mirabito's trademark."

The award will be presented at NYACS' annual Chairman's Banquet on May 13, 2010, at the Oncenter in Syracuse, N.Y., capping the 2010 NYACS Trade Show.

Mirabito Energy Products, which operates 53 Quickway and Convenience Express locations in upstate New York, is a third-generation energy distribution and marketing company that has grown and expanded from a coal business started by James Mirabito in Norwich, N.Y., in 1927. Today, Mirabito supplies homes and businesses with motor fuels, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, biodiesel and other energy products and services.

Through the annual Mirabito Golf Classic and MDA Shamrock sales at its retail stores, Mirabito has raised nearly $2 million for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) and supports many other community organizations, as well.
