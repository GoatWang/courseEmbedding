Q: "I want to invest, but I don't want to lose money."
A: We absolutely understand your fear. And you're absolutely not alone.
You're investing your hard-earned dollars to make your dreams come true, not to see it drip out of your brokerage account like change through a hole in your pocket.
The truth is that loss happens. Even the world's best investors pick the occasional dud.

They understand that if you buy and hold for the long term, it's possible one of your investments could go to 0. But you can gain many, many times more than you could ever lose.
And they play it smart.

"Motley Fool's changed my life in this main respect: I'm financially independent today. I didn't think that would be possible until maybe my mid or late 60s. I have the ability to make choices and quality-of-life decisions now that I would never be able to make before."





Bob A.


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."


And see the advice Linda has for folks just getting started with investing...



Linda Q.


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a [30-day] membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."

Wall Street is getting it all wrong... And we believe the little guy can outsmart the market with a simple investing strategy
Our time-tested investing approach has resulted in market-beating returns. In fact, The Motley Fool's newsletter services earned the top three spots in Wall Street Journal columnist Mark Hulbert's August 2013 ranking of more than 200 services he tracks.





The Motley Fool's Secret to Uncovering Wealth-Building Buys




Buy Businesses, Not TickersStraight from the mouth of famed investor Peter Lynch, we buy into a company's prospects, future, and management, and we put our money into companies that will generate shareholder value over the long term.


Be a Lifetime InvestorWe're investors that believe the best way to beat the market is to hold stocks for the long term. But we don't just buy and forget about our stocks. We dive deep into research, keep a close eye on our investing thesis, and relentlessly pursue compelling stocks we think will outperform.




Fish Where Others Aren'tWe're not interested in following the crowds or what Wall Street thinks is the next hot stock. That's a money-losing strategy! We are interested in thinking for ourselves and scoring profits with unbiased research.


Be Foolish and Have FunMany believe the little guy can't win in the market, but we believe our members can beat Wall Street professionals... and we think you should have fun along the way.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.
The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Fund Overview

The Motley Fool Great America Fund seeks excellent small and mid-cap companies at what we consider to be attractive prices.
We look for well-managed companies that boast strong financial positions and operate in industries that our management team truly understands. Performing rigorous, fundamental analysis, we dissect each company's strategy, competitive position, operations, and performance, and we review all pertinent public documents and official communications about the company. We purchase high quality businesses with an intention to hold for years because long-term buy and hold investing allows for value to compound in a tax efficient manner. We will sell when business quality deteriorates or the valuation of the shares becomes unattractive. As part of our assessment to sell shares, we consider industry developments including technological advances, intensifying competition, and regulatory changes.

The performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher. The investment return and principal of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. A redemption fee of 2.00% of the then-current value of the shares redeemed is imposed on redemptions of shares made within 90 days of purchase (i.e., the redemption is effective on or before the 90th day following the date of purchase), subject to certain exceptions. The redemption fee is not reflected in the quoted returns. See additional performance information about each fund at these links: Independence Fund, Great America Fund and Emerging Markets Fund.

We may use such files to provide personalized features, understand how people are using our website, or make it easier for you to access your account. We don't use them to obtain personal information from your hard drive. We will not share information from these files with others, except to help service your account.

What Is a Trust Fund?
Trust funds offer several advantages, and best of all, you don't need to be rich to set one up. 






When we think of trust funds, we often imagine wealthy families setting up their children for life. But in reality, non-wealthy families can also benefit from trust funds. A trust fund is a fund that consists of assets intended to benefit an individual or organization. A trust fund might be comprised of assets such as stocks, bonds, cash, or property. In the case of an individual beneficiary, the recipient of the trust must often wait to reach a certain age, or until a certain event occurs, to receive income from the fund. Until then, a trustee is tasked with managing the fund as per the specifications of the person who set up the trust.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
Parties in a trust fund
There are three important players in a trust fund. The first, the grantor, is the individual who establishes the trust in the first place. This grantor is the person who contributes assets to the fund and who decides how the fund should be managed. Then there's the beneficiary, the person who gets to benefit financially from the trust. A trust fund beneficiary is often the child or grandchild of a wealthy grantor, but it can also be a charity or organization. Finally, there's the trustee, who can be a single person or a group of people tasked with overseeing the trust fund and ensuring that it's managed as per the instructions of the grantor. Trustees are often paid a fee in exchange for their services, and some are given more power than others in managing trusts. Some, for example, are given the authority to select investments for the funds they manage, while others are simply responsible for distributing payments as per the grantor's request.
Benefits of trust funds
Setting up a trust fund is a great way to ensure that your beneficiaries are taken care of financially, especially after your passing. While a will serves a similar function, a trust fund offers an added layer of protection if you fall ill or become mentally or physically incapable of managing your own finances and affairs. Furthermore, there are certain tax advantages to be gained by setting up a trust fund. Trust funds can be established in a manner that helps minimize estate taxes, thus ensuring that more money goes to your beneficiaries.





Revocable trusts
A revocable, or living, trust is a type of trust in which a grantor places assets during his or her lifetime. Those assets are then transferred to the fund's beneficiaries after the grantor's death. The benefit of revocable trusts is that the grantor has the ability to make changes to the way they're set up. Another major advantage of revocable trusts is that, unlike wills, the assets in question aren't subject to probate, an often-lengthy legal process following a person's death. Rather, the assets are typically distributed quickly to the beneficiaries designated in the trust.
Charitable remainder trusts
A charitable remainder trust is a type of trust in which a grantor designates assets to be donated to a specified charity. The charity serves as the trustee of the trust and manages its assets. As those assets produce income, the charity pays the grantor, or another named beneficiary, a portion of that income for a certain period of time as established in the trust. Once that period ends (which may or may not coincide with the death of the grantor), the assets go to that charity. With a charitable remainder trust, the grantor gets an immediate tax benefit, and once the trust's assets are completely transferred to the assigned charity, they're no longer subject to federal estate taxes.
Though there are several benefits to setting up a trust, the process can also be complicated. Most individuals therefore require the help of an attorney in establishing trust funds for their beneficiaries.

5) S&P Capital IQ Picks Japan Exposure via 3 ETFs
Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Capital IQ ETF analyst, singled out in a July 16 report on MarketScope Advisor three ETFs that provide Japan exposure—since, according to his report, despite the tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese equities are down only slightly in 2012 and outpacing many international markets.

Last Updated Mar 4, 2011 5:17 PM EST

As we noted yesterday, the financial Web site the Motley Fool dispenses some good advice, but fails to back that up when creating their own mutual funds. They're demonstrating that like most of Wall Street and the financial media, their interests come before yours.
About a decade ago, the Web site used to maintain real money model portfolios. This was pretty distinguishing at the time, as this meant their strategies were in the public's full view. Unlike some money managers and newsletter publishers who require a "just trust me" approach, the Motley Fool was subject to open scorn for underperforming.
At the end of February 2003, the brothers announced that they were discontinuing publication of their real money model portfolios. Why would the Motley Fool choose to get rid of their portfolios? According to their Web site, the Motley Fool concluded that the real-money aspect of their portfolios had gotten in the way of their educational function.
Given the track record of their portfolios, a cynic would suggest another answer. Being skeptical of all claims of ability to beat the market, we went to our trusty videotape to check the performance record of the Foolish strategies. According to the calculations of the Hulbert Financial Digest, the Motley Fool's portfolios produced a 1.3 percent annualized return over the six-year period that Hulbert tracked their performance. Over the same period, the Wilshire 5000 (a broad market index) produced an annualized return of 3.4 percent. This is a comparable result to the findings of numerous studies on actively managed mutual funds -- they underperform by approximately 1.5 percent per year on a pre-tax basis.
It's also important to note that Hulbert's data includes several portfolios that the Fool used to maintain but were discontinued along the way. Thus, there's none of the usual survivorship bias in the data. Obviously, the Fools had been fooled into believing that they had found strategies that were likely to produce above market returns. One last note of interest. The man responsible for running these portfolios was William Mann, who currently runs the Motley Fool funds we examined yesterday.*
On the surface it appears that the Fools have failed to learn from their past mistakes (engaging in insane behavior). There's also another explanation for such Foolish behavior. The Fools know that their funds aren't likely to outperform, but they're likely to generate profits for them because of the high expense ratios of the funds, the very type fees they have been lambasting for years.
* To clarify, William Mann served as the senior analyst for the Motley Fool during some of the period Hulbert examined, not for the entire period. Apologies for the error.

Can I trust the Motley Fool?

A while back I checked out The Motley Fool while doing some research on mutual funds. I found their educational content to be a great overview of what to look for and started exploring. While The Motley Fool has a lot of great content, I'm not entirely comfortable with their incessant up-selling. 
They always so eager to tell me about some "insiders" stock of the day that they are sure is just about to explode tomorrow if only I will give them some of my valuable personal information. Is this a scam? Are they just using their legacy educational content to bait people into their premium services? Are their premium services even any good? The Motley Fool once had a fair amount of Internet street cred.
Are The Motley Fool's stock picks and services worth giving any mind share to or are they just another Jim Cramer loudly shouting ticker symbols to sell advertisements?

Years ago, I started a trial subscription to one of their newsletters and then cancelled.  During the following months, they advertised the subscription to me for lesser and lesser fees until I finally bought a subscription at the reduced price for educational purposes, even though I had no money at all to invest at the time.

The Motley Fool is generally regarded as relatively legit, at least in that they're not likely to do anything outright fraudulent and they definitely have reasonably in-depth content to provide you. 
The Motley Fool makes a fair amount of money off the subscriptions, though, and they do hawk them quite violently. If I didn't have a generally good opinion of them to begin with, I'd have been completely put off as well. It's pretty shameful.
I don't think it's worth hundreds of dollars a year, but then again, I don't look at investing as a second career like the Fool likes to suggest, either.

I agree with fennec on this. I visit Motley Fool regularly and like their analysis of things. It tends to be reasonable and hype free (though there are exceptions, there are far fewer than other places). I have not bought any of their paid content and unless you have a bunch of money riding on it, it may not be cost effective (you may not get the money you paid back in increased investment returns).

Upselling you is how they make money.  That's the price of the free content.
Test their recommendations.  Pretend to buy the stocks they say.  How do they do?  Do they ever say to sell the stocks after their buy recommendations?
There are lots and lots of opinions out there.  I doubt people really hear about the good ones because (a) the good ones have paid newsletters and/or (b) the good ones aren't telling a soul because they're absolutely cleaning it up.
Warren Buffett doesn't announce his intentions.  He's been buying for a while before anyone finds out.

I've had a MF Stock Advisor for 7 or 8 years now, and I've belong to Supernova for a couple of years. I also have money in one of their mutual funds.
"The Fool" has a lot of very good educational information available, especially for people who are new to investing. Many people do not understand that Wall Street is in the business of making money for Wall Street, not making money for investors. 
I have stayed with the Fool because their philosophy aligns with my personal investment philosophy. I look at the Stock Advisor picks; sometimes I buy them, sometimes I don't, but the analysis is very good. They also have been good at tracking their picks over time, and writing updates when specific stocks drop a certain amount. With their help, I've assembled a portfolio that I don't have to spend too much time managing, and have done pretty well from a return perspective.
Stock Advisor also has a good set of forums where you can interact with other investors. 
In summary, the view from the inside has been pretty good.
From the outside, I think their marketing is a reflection of the fact that most people aren't very interested in a rational & conservative approach to investing in the stock market, so MF chooses to go for an approach that gets more traffic. I'm not particularly excited about it, but I'm sure they've done AB testing and have figured out what way works the best.
I think that they have had money-back guarantees on some of their programs in the past, so you could try them out risk free. Not sure if those are still around.

Not sure how I came across the Motley Fool blog in the first instance, but found the writing style refreshing - then along came some free advice on ASX share prospects, then the next day and email expounding the benefits I would get by joining up for two years at 60% off if I hit the button "now", getting in at ground floor on the next technology stock rocket - I replied:
"What a hard sell - why wouldn't I apply the age old adage of " If it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is"
Their reply was;
"Thanks for your note. The honest answer is that despite people knowing they should do something to help themselves prepare for their financial futures, few actually do it. We find these messages actually work in getting people to hit 'yes', much better than an understated email that just says 'here are our results and our philosophy - let us know if you're interested', unfortunately.
Yours Foolishly"
So I have put some of these recommendations onto a watch list, time will tell.

I would personally beware of the Motley Fool. Their success is based largely on their original investment strategy book. It had a lot of good advice in it, but it pushed a strategy called "The Foolish Four" which was an investing strategy.
Since it was based on a buy-and-hold method with 18-month evaluation intervals, it was not a get-rich-quick scheme. However, its methods were validated through data mining and subsequently turned out to be not so good.
At least they admit this: http://www.fool.com/ddow/2000/ddow001214.htm

Bob A.


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."

The Motley Fool












Wall Street is getting it all wrong... And we believe the little guy can outsmart the market with a simple investing strategy
Our time-tested investing approach has resulted in market-beating returns. In fact, The Motley Fool's newsletter services earned the top three spots in Wall Street Journal columnist Mark Hulbert's August 2013 ranking of more than 200 services he tracks.





The Motley Fool's Secret to Uncovering Wealth-Building Buys




Buy Businesses, Not TickersStraight from the mouth of famed investor Peter Lynch, we buy into a company's prospects, future, and management, and we put our money into companies that will generate shareholder value over the long term.


Be a Lifetime InvestorWe're investors that believe the best way to beat the market is to hold stocks for the long term. But we don't just buy and forget about our stocks. We dive deep into research, keep a close eye on our investing thesis, and relentlessly pursue compelling stocks we think will outperform.




Fish Where Others Aren'tWe're not interested in following the crowds or what Wall Street thinks is the next hot stock. That's a money-losing strategy! We are interested in thinking for ourselves and scoring profits with unbiased research.


Be Foolish and Have FunMany believe the little guy can't win in the market, but we believe our members can beat Wall Street professionals... and we think you should have fun along the way.

Mark T.
Des Moines, Iowa


"Motley Fool's changed my life in this main respect: I'm financially independent today. I didn't think that would be possible until maybe my mid or late 60s. I have the ability to make choices and quality-of-life decisions now that I would never be able to make before."





Bob A.
Austin, Texas


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."


And see the advice Linda has for folks just getting started with investing…


"The first thing is they have to try it. They have to give it a chance for one month. Make the effort, make the commitment, and see for yourself."





Linda Q.
Nashua, New Hampshire


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
