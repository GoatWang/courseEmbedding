Cut sites of enzymes that you select are highlighted to help guide your work.
(Enzymes with compatible ends turn the same color.)
Selecting cut sites and copying the sequence will also activate enzymes.

Benchling, Inc. Key Developments

Benchling Announces Molecular Biology 2.0 Software
Jan 31 17
Benchling announced the release of its Molecular Biology 2.0 system, an unprecedented extension of its existing molecular biology suite to power high-throughput sequence design for DNA, proteins, and CRISPR. Molecular Biology 2.0 incorporates batch sequence design, CRISPR design, and cloning software, as well as full-fledged protein design and alignment tools, with the company platform's natively integrated bioregistration system and lab notebook. Molecular Biology 2.0 brings the unique biological contextualization afforded by the company, Bioregistry to high-throughput molecular biology work conducted by industry scientists. This allows for intelligent linkages between plasmids, protein sequences, and the parts they encode and offers transformative functionality for many areas of drug discovery, such as immunotherapy, gene therapy, synthetic biology, and antibody discovery. In antibody discovery, for example, this allows a scientist to create a plasmid encoding for a heavy chain, define a field on that plasmid that links to a protein sequence for the heavy chain, and apply a constraint to confirm that the amino acids linked to are a translation of that region of the plasmid. Combined with Molecular Biology 2.0's batch sequence design and cloning tools, which allow scientists to design sequences and, in an industry-first, translate protein chains in batch, the company has effectively created the first ELN-based batch antibody engineering tool. Beyond Molecular Biology 2.0's protein design and alignment and batch design and cloning tools, the company has developed the first batch CRISPR design tool for enterprise use. Building on top of the company platform's CRISPR tool, which was co-developed with leading academic labs at MIT and Harvard and boasts speeds 100x faster than its leading competitor, batch CRISPR empowers scientists to design guides and gather on-target and off-target scores for hundreds of genes simultaneously. The tool automatically detects exons for each gene and conducts the full analysis in seconds. the company is already the de facto platform used by many of the most innovative CRISPR companies and teams around the world.


Benchling Launches Bioregistration and Inventory Management System to Enable Accelerated Biologics R&D
Nov 15 16
Benchling announced the launch of its Bioregistry system, releasing groundbreaking capabilities for complex biological entity registration and strain management. The Bioregistry is a major addition to Benchling's cloud lab informatics platform and is integrated seamlessly with Benchling's native lab notebook and molecular biology tools. The Benchling Bioregistry extends beyond the scope of similar registration software through its flexibility for inventory complexity, automatic data gathering through Benchling's lab notebook and molecular biology tools, and integrations with its upcoming LIMS product. Benching's Bioregistry is the first software of its kind that's flexible enough to support the complex relationships of any biological entities. It can accommodate the complete hierarchy of antibody discovery workflows, encompassing antibody complexes, protein chains, and plasmids that encode those protein chains. Constraints can be easily configured to validate uniqueness at each level of this hierarchy and enforce biological validity, such as ensuring protein chains are proper translations of plasmid regions. Through integration with Benchling's lab notebook, the Bioregistry can create bidirectional links between notebook entries and registered entities. Users can view all entries where a particular entity was mentioned, and all entities mentioned in a particular entry. The Bioregistry is also the first registration system that's natively integrated from the ground up with a full suite of molecular biology tools. Through this integration, the Bioregistry can register any plasmid file, automatically parse it out into its parts, and register those as well, with those registered parts being automatically linked to the original registered plasmid. And by combining registered parts, scientists can create wholly new constructs. The company estimates these automation features will increase research productivity by upwards of 30%. Through integration with Benchling's in-development LIMS, the Bioregistry allows for sample tracking and lineage tracing for physical samples in the lab. Although Benchling's LIMS is in limited rollout, the LIMS and Bioregistry work together to automatically parse results from notebook entries and append them to registered entities.
