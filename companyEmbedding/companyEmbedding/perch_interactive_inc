Perch can work with a single product or a whole suite of products. In fact, it can handle as many products as you can fit on a table without overlapping. Here, the selection of sunglasses is presented as a collection. Touching any one pair of sunglasses reveals information and a photo that is specific to the chosen pair. Meanwhile the animated background draws visitors in from across the store, and even from outside the store.
