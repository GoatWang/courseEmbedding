CB Financial Services, Inc. Promotes Patrick G. O'Brien To President And Announces Results Of Annual Shareholders' Meeting






GlobeNewswire



May 17, 2017 4:30 PM EDT













 


















































 CARMICHAELS, Pa., May 17, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CB Financial Services, Inc. ("CB Financial" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:CBFV), the holding company of Community Bank and Exchange Underwriters, Inc., a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of Community Bank, today announced that Mark E. Fox, William C. Groves, John J. LaCarte and David F. Pollock were-elected as Directors, each to a three-year term, at the annual shareholders' meeting held today.  Shareholders also ratified Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accountants. At the annual re-organization meetings of the Boards of Directors which followed the annual shareholders' meeting, Patrick G. ("Pat") O'Brien was promoted to President of both CB Financial and Community Bank.   Barron P. McCune, Jr. will continue in the role of CEO of both organizations.  In addition, Executive Vice President of Loan Administration, Ralph Burchianti was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer. Ralph J. Sommers, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Directors of CB Financial and Community Bank, said, "We look forward to working with Mr. O'Brien as he prepares to assume the role of President and CEO when Mr. McCune eventually retires.  We also would like to recognize Ralph Burchianti for his long and valuable service to the Bank." Barron P. ("Pat") McCune, Jr., Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CB Financial and Community Bank, stated, "I have known Pat O'Brien well for thirty years.  During that time he has been an exceptional banker and community leader throughout the tri-state area.  Pat was the President and CEO of First Federal Savings Bank ("First Federal") when Community Bank and First Federal merged in 2014.  Since that time, he has served as the Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of CB Financial and Community Bank.  Pat shares my commitment to outstanding customer service and community development.  As I have begun to contemplate my eventual retirement, I recommended to the Board of Directors that Pat O'Brien be promoted to the office of President and be my eventual successor.  We are fortunate to have Pat and I am pleased that the Board has appointed him as President.  I will continue in my role as CEO of Community Bank and CB Financial Services, Inc. until my retirement.  I look forward to continuing to work with Pat to make Community Bank a better and more valuable company."  Mr. McCune also noted that he and Mr. O'Brien have worked together on many non-profit and community endeavors during their long friendship.

Cash Dividend On The Way From CB Financial Services (CBFV)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 12/5/14, CB Financial Services Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.21, payable on 12/19/14. As a percentage of CBFV's recent stock price of $19.63, this dividend works out to approximately 1.07%, so look for shares of CB Financial Services Inc to trade 1.07% lower — all else being equal — when CBFV shares open for trading on 12/5/14.

I was born and raised in Carona, Ks. so it was of particular interest to me. Growing up there I had heard about the bootlegging activities that had taken place before I was born but I didn't realize it was so wide spread or of such volume.0Comment|
