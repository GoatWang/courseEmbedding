    IR Contacts Print Page  |   E-mail Page  |   RSS  |   E-mail AlertsProducts and ServicesProducts for UsersProducts for Advertising andMarketing CustomersProducts for Platform PartnersProducts for Users Our product development approach is centered on building simple and useful tools to enable our users to access Weibo to create, distribute and discover content and interact with others on our platform in real time. We employ a “mobile first” philosophy and have designed our platform around the capabilities of mobile devices. We introduced the first generation of Weibo mobile app in the first quarter of 2010. Our platform is compatible with all major mobile operating systems, including Android, iOS, Symbian, Windows and Blackberry, and is accessible through mobile apps, mobile websites, personal computer apps and personal computer websites. Our users range from ordinary people to celebrities, businesses, government agencies and other organizations.Self-Expression Products We offer the following products to enable our users to express themselves on our 

platform:FeedWeibo enables users to express and share their ideas, opinions and stories in the form of text and attach multimedia, including photos, music, short videos and blogs. The text in a feed is limited to 140 Chinese characters. Since Chinese characters are much more information-dense than letters of the alphabet, more meaning can be conveyed in 140 Chinese characters than in the same number of letters. Feeds on Weibo, therefore, tend to be content-rich, descriptive and vivid, while still fitting onto the screen of a mobile device.Individual PageEach user has a Page that displays the user’s profile, feeds and album. Basic information about a user, including username, introduction, education, location, liked feeds, accounts followed, fans accounts and Weibo account number, is available on the user’s Page. Users with verified authentic identity information will have an orange “V” mark on their profile picture. Users can personalize their Pages by selecting and changing their cover photo and profile picture at any time.Enterprise PageBusinesses and other organizations with verified identities can apply for enterprise accounts, which entitle them to enterprise services through the download of Page apps on our platform. Page apps enable organizations to customize their Weibo Pages and to perform marketing events, promotion activities, ad campaigns and payment processing on Weibo. For example, an e-commerce merchant can install Page apps to facilitate purchase activities through Weibo or offer “red envelop,” lucky money, drawings to build a fan base.Social ProductsWe offer the following mechanisms to promote social interaction between users on our platform:Follow Users can establish relationships with other users by electing to follow them. Feeds that are posted or reposted by a user will automatically appear in the information feed of the user’s follower. Relationships may be asymmetrical. The user being followed does not need to approve the follower’s decision to follow them, although a user can choose to limit access to certain feeds or to blacklist a certain follower.RepostBy clicking on the Repost button, users can repost feeds from other users. When a feed is reposted, the original author is able to virally reach and influence users beyond that author’s own circle of followers, leveraging the network of the followers of the author’s followers, sometimes many degrees away.Comment  Users can add their own comments when they repost and share their view on the original feed with their followers. Users can also leave comments on a feed by clicking on the Comment button.Like  If users like a feed, they can click on the Like button to express their support for the feed. At the bottom of each feed, users can see how many people have Reposted, Commented on or Liked the feed.FavoriteUsers can save feeds into their favorites by clicking on the Favorite button.@Mention Users can view their history of interactions with other users by going to the @Mention Page, which allows users to access all the feeds in which they are mentioned by other users. In addition, users can see a list of comments from other users on their own feeds, as well as the Likes on their feeds.Messenger  Users can send private messages in the form of text or voice recordings and can attach photos, locations and group contact cards. In addition, users can also use messengers to hand out “red envelops”, lucky money, and receive payments from other users.Group Chat  Group Chat enables users to organize and participate in conversations based on common interest. For example, fans of a celebrity can establish chat rooms to share the latest gossips and tidbits, and the celebrity himself may choose to “drop in” to increase the livelihood of his fan base.Discovery ProductsWe offer the following products to help users discover content on our platform: Information Feed The information feed resides on the user’s home page. Each user’s information feed displays a regularly updating flow of feeds posted by that user and by other users he or she has decided to follow. Since Weibo allows users to follow other users without establishing a reciprocal relationship, users are able to personalize whom to follow based on their interests. In other words, users can as easily follow celebrities and strangers as they follow friends and acquaintances. The default setting for the information feed is the timeline, where the most recent feed is shown at the top. To improve user experience, promoted content, hot feeds and missed feeds are added to a user’s information feed based on a user’s social network as well as the level of engagement of feeds from accounts followed. Users can also customize their information feed by classifying followed accounts into different groups, e.g. friends, co-workers, e-commerce, fashion, media and photography, and view feeds from each group separately.SearchOur search function allows users to search our platform for feeds, users, apps and pictures by keyword and hashtag.Object Pages We work with companies with large online content libraries of videos, songs, mobile applications, books and points of interest (such as restaurants, hotels and movie theaters) and create Weibo Pages for their objects, known as Object Pages. Users can visit these Object Pages to find rich content on these objects and interact with other users of similar interest. For example, users can stream songs, watch movie trailers, read book excerpts and download apps from the respective Object Pages. With Weibo location-based services, users can locate popular points of interest, find information about them, such as show times for movie theaters and menus for restaurants, access coupons, post comments, and see reviews shared by other users. Some Object Pages also offer the sale of movie tickets and books and app downloads.Trends Trends are lists of hot topics on Weibo. A user can start a topic discussion by adding hashtags (#)  around a word or phrase in a feed. The key word or phrase then becomes searchable with a single click. Users may view feeds under each trending topic and participate in the discussion.Discovery Channel Our users can also explore the hottest trending topics being discussed on Weibo by visiting the discovery channel, where popular feeds are aggregated by category, such as humor, astrology, comics, food, technology, auto, sports, reading, recruiting, charity, news, travel, movie, songs, purchase, video, lottery and T-mall flash sales. The discovery channel also offers an online game center and app download center, as well as content discovery using location-based services functions.NotificationsUsers can choose to be notified of Weibo account activities through SMS or push notification 

on their device. Weibo GamesWe offer third-party online games, including role playing games, card games, strategy games and real life simulation games. Most Weibo games are offered for free and certain games allow users to purchase virtual currency, known as Weibo Credit, to redeem virtual items. Weibo receives part of the revenues from such purchases through arrangements with the game developers.VIP MembershipWeibo VIP membership offers our users certain services and functions that are not available to regular users. With these additional functions, VIP members can follow more users, have more ways to personalize their Pages, can send voice feeds, enjoy more cloud storage, receive additional options to manage information flow and followers, receive SMS notification of Weibo account activity and have access to premium games. VIP membership is available through monthly or annual subscriptions.Weibo Apps We have developed a suite of mobile apps to further enrich the service offerings of Weibo. For example, Weibo Headlines aggregates news and information from Weibo and other online sources based on an article’s popularity and enables users to comment, like and share to their fans on Weibo. Another example is Weibo Weather (Tianqitong), a leading weather app in China that features weather condition, particle matter index (PMI) and other information, such as scenic photos from cities that the users selected to follow.Products for Advertising and Marketing CustomersWe seek to provide advertising and marketing solutions to enable our customers to promote their brands and conduct effective marketing activities. We provide our customers with analytical tools to enable them to track and improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns on our platform. Our advertising and marketing customers include key accounts, Alibaba/e-commerce merchants, SMEs and individuals that seek a full spectrum of online advertising and marketing services ranging from brand awareness to interest generation, sales conversion and loyalty marketing.Social Display AdsSocial display ads appear on a user’s home page and other pages. When users click on the social ad, they may be redirected to the advertiser’s Weibo Page for further engagement.Promoted Marketing  Our promoted marketing offerings include the following:Promoted FeedsPromoted feeds appear in the user’s information feed alongside organic feeds. We encourage our customers to produce feeds that have relevant information value similar to that of the users’ organic feeds. Customers may use our SIG recommendation engine to better target their audience and improve the relevancy of the ad to the users. As with other feeds, users can Repost, Comment on and Like promoted feeds, amplifying the visibility and reach of the original promoted feed and generating earned media to our customers. We offer promoted feeds tailored to different customer segments such as:FSTFST is a customizable and self-service marketing solution offered mostly to SMEs under a bidding system. Customers are able to target users based on gender, age, geographic location, interests and device type. They can also target users by their social interaction on our platform. For example, they may target all of the followers of a given user. SMEs can place FST ads either through our authorized distributors, who have expertise in social media marketing, or directly by themselves using our self-service advertising system;Fans HeadlineFans Headline is a promoted service that guarantees a certain feed from the customer will appear at the top of the information feeds of the customer’s followers;Weibo SelectWeibo Select is a highly customizable version of promoted feeds offered to large brand advertisers, or key account customers. We work directly with the customer or the customer’s ad agency to define the parameters of the targeted marketing. For example, in addition to targeting users based on demographics and social relationships, customers can target users who have engaged with feeds using a specific keyword during a specified time period; andWeibo ExpressWeibo Express is a promoted service offered to key accounts for them to reach and engage with a broad range of Weibo users.Promoted AccountsPromoted accounts appear either in a column next to the information feed on PC or directly in the information feed on both PC and mobile devices. Promoted accounts are labeled but otherwise appear in the same format as other accounts that we recommend to our users. Promoted accounts provide customers a way to grow their followers, with whom they can then drive engagement using their Weibo Pages.Promoted TrendsPromoted trends, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics. When a user clicks on a promoted trend, he will be redirected to the sponsor’s landing page.We provide our advertising and marketing customers with analytical tools to enable them to 

track and improve the effectiveness of their campaigns on our platform.  Products for Platform PartnersWe seek to provide our platform partners with tools and APIs that they can use to share their content to our platform, distribute Weibo content across their properties and enhance their websites and applications with Weibo content, and to build social apps on Weibo or integrate their products with Weibo. Our platform partners include traditional and online media outlets as well as developers of games and other applications. Products offered for our platform partners include:Weibo Connect The following products allow our platform partners to link their websites and mobile apps to our platform, enabling their users to share content to Weibo:Single Sign-on RegistrationUsers can register for access to our platform partners’ websites and apps with their Weibo accounts instead of creating new accounts online. This feature eliminates the need for users to register and create a new log-in identity for each website or app they visit, making it easier to explore new websites and apps requiring log-in.Social PluginsSocial plugins are a set of embedded widgets, such as Share, Like, Comment and Follow, that allow users to access the functionality of Weibo from third-party websites and mobile apps. By installing Weibo social plugins on their websites or mobile apps, our partners enable their users to share content to Weibo, which may direct traffic of interested Weibo users back to their properties.Multimedia CardsMultimedia cards allow our mobile app partners to enable their users to share multimedia content, such as photos, songs and short videos, in a feed to Weibo. Content shared on multimedia cards is tagged and can be discovered by users who search for the tagged keywords.Weibo ServiceOur open application programming interfaces allow third-party developers to build apps to serve individual and organization users.App Application Programming InterfacesWe provide our platform partners a set of application programming interfaces that they can use to develop apps for our platform. Currently, the most popular category of these apps is Weibo games.Page App Application Programming InterfacesOur Page app application programming interfaces allow platform partners to develop apps that improve the features and functionalities of Weibo Pages. For example, an e-commerce merchant can install a Page app that enables users to view and purchase its goods on Weibo. Page apps created by platform partners are becoming increasingly popular. We allow app developers to charge for the Page apps, but we currently do not have revenue share on these appsEnterprise Application Programming InterfacesWe offer enterprise services to businesses and other organizations through enterprise application programming interfaces. For example, our enhanced messaging application programming interfaces facilitate more convenient interaction between users and their followers. Using the application programming interfaces, third-party developers enable organizations to send private bulk messages, also known as DY, to followers who have opted in to such subscriptions. For example, many followers of the China Earthquake Networks Center have subscribed for earthquake news alerts. With the DY subscription function, the Center is able to send timely earthquake news through Weibo’s messenger to all of its subscribers at once. We also provide data application programming interfaces to third-party developers for them to provide data analytics services to brands and businesses.Weibo Credit Weibo Credit allows our users to purchase in-game virtual items and other types of fee-based services on Weibo and for our platform partners to receive payment in an easy-to-use, secure and trusted environment.Weibo WalletWeibo wallet enables individuals and businesses to hand out “red envelops” to build a bigger and more active fan base.Copyright ©  Weibo Corp.

Since Weibo allows users to follow other users without establishing a reciprocal relationship, users are able to personalize whom to follow based on their interests. In other words, users can as easily follow celebrities and strangers as they follow friends and acquaintances. The default setting for the information feed is the timeline, where the most recent feed is shown at the top. To improve user experience, promoted content, hot feeds and missed feeds are added to a user’s information feed based on a user’s social network as well as the level of engagement of feeds from accounts followed. Users can also customize their information feed by classifying followed accounts into different groups, e.g. friends, co-workers, e-commerce, fashion, media and photography, and view feeds from each group separately.SearchOur search function allows users to search our platform for feeds, users, apps and pictures by keyword and hashtag.Object Pages We work with companies with large online content libraries of videos, songs, mobile applications, books and points of interest (such as restaurants, hotels and movie theaters) and create Weibo Pages for their objects, known as Object Pages. Users can visit these Object Pages to find rich content on these objects and interact with other users of similar interest. For example, users can stream songs, watch movie trailers, read book excerpts and download apps from the respective Object Pages. With Weibo location-based services, users can locate popular points of interest, find information about them, such as show times for movie theaters and menus for restaurants, access coupons, post comments, and see reviews shared by other users. Some Object Pages also offer the sale of movie tickets and books and app downloads.Trends Trends are lists of hot topics on Weibo. A user can start a topic discussion by adding hashtags (#)  around a word or phrase in a feed. The key word or phrase then becomes searchable with a single click. Users may view feeds under each trending topic and participate in the discussion.Discovery Channel Our users can also explore the hottest trending topics being discussed on Weibo by visiting the discovery channel, where popular feeds are aggregated by category, such as humor, astrology, comics, food, technology, auto, sports, reading, recruiting, charity, news, travel, movie, songs, purchase, video, lottery and T-mall flash sales. The discovery channel also offers an online game center and app download center, as well as content discovery using location-based services functions.NotificationsUsers can choose to be notified of Weibo account activities through SMS or push notification 

on their device. Weibo GamesWe offer third-party online games, including role playing games, card games, strategy games and real life simulation games. Most Weibo games are offered for free and certain games allow users to purchase virtual currency, known as Weibo Credit, to redeem virtual items. Weibo receives part of the revenues from such purchases through arrangements with the game developers.VIP MembershipWeibo VIP membership offers our users certain services and functions that are not available to regular users. With these additional functions, VIP members can follow more users, have more ways to personalize their Pages, can send voice feeds, enjoy more cloud storage, receive additional options to manage information flow and followers, receive SMS notification of Weibo account activity and have access to premium games. VIP membership is available through monthly or annual subscriptions.Weibo Apps We have developed a suite of mobile apps to further enrich the service offerings of Weibo. For example, Weibo Headlines aggregates news and information from Weibo and other online sources based on an article’s popularity and enables users to comment, like and share to their fans on Weibo. Another example is Weibo Weather (Tianqitong), a leading weather app in China that features weather condition, particle matter index (PMI) and other information, such as scenic photos from cities that the users selected to follow.Products for Advertising and Marketing CustomersWe seek to provide advertising and marketing solutions to enable our customers to promote their brands and conduct effective marketing activities. We provide our customers with analytical tools to enable them to track and improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns on our platform. Our advertising and marketing customers include key accounts, Alibaba/e-commerce merchants, SMEs and individuals that seek a full spectrum of online advertising and marketing services ranging from brand awareness to interest generation, sales conversion and loyalty marketing.Social Display AdsSocial display ads appear on a user’s home page and other pages. When users click on the social ad, they may be redirected to the advertiser’s Weibo Page for further engagement.Promoted Marketing  Our promoted marketing offerings include the following:Promoted FeedsPromoted feeds appear in the user’s information feed alongside organic feeds. We encourage our customers to produce feeds that have relevant information value similar to that of the users’ organic feeds. Customers may use our SIG recommendation engine to better target their audience and improve the relevancy of the ad to the users. As with other feeds, users can Repost, Comment on and Like promoted feeds, amplifying the visibility and reach of the original promoted feed and generating earned media to our customers. We offer promoted feeds tailored to different customer segments such as:FSTFST is a customizable and self-service marketing solution offered mostly to SMEs under a bidding system. Customers are able to target users based on gender, age, geographic location, interests and device type. They can also target users by their social interaction on our platform. For example, they may target all of the followers of a given user. SMEs can place FST ads either through our authorized distributors, who have expertise in social media marketing, or directly by themselves using our self-service advertising system;Fans HeadlineFans Headline is a promoted service that guarantees a certain feed from the customer will appear at the top of the information feeds of the customer’s followers;Weibo SelectWeibo Select is a highly customizable version of promoted feeds offered to large brand advertisers, or key account customers. We work directly with the customer or the customer’s ad agency to define the parameters of the targeted marketing. For example, in addition to targeting users based on demographics and social relationships, customers can target users who have engaged with feeds using a specific keyword during a specified time period; andWeibo ExpressWeibo Express is a promoted service offered to key accounts for them to reach and engage with a broad range of Weibo users.Promoted AccountsPromoted accounts appear either in a column next to the information feed on PC or directly in the information feed on both PC and mobile devices. Promoted accounts are labeled but otherwise appear in the same format as other accounts that we recommend to our users. Promoted accounts provide customers a way to grow their followers, with whom they can then drive engagement using their Weibo Pages.Promoted TrendsPromoted trends, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics. When a user clicks on a promoted trend, he will be redirected to the sponsor’s landing page.We provide our advertising and marketing customers with analytical tools to enable them to 

track and improve the effectiveness of their campaigns on our platform.  Products for Platform PartnersWe seek to provide our platform partners with tools and APIs that they can use to share their content to our platform, distribute Weibo content across their properties and enhance their websites and applications with Weibo content, and to build social apps on Weibo or integrate their products with Weibo. Our platform partners include traditional and online media outlets as well as developers of games and other applications. Products offered for our platform partners include:Weibo Connect The following products allow our platform partners to link their websites and mobile apps to our platform, enabling their users to share content to Weibo:Single Sign-on RegistrationUsers can register for access to our platform partners’ websites and apps with their Weibo accounts instead of creating new accounts online. This feature eliminates the need for users to register and create a new log-in identity for each website or app they visit, making it easier to explore new websites and apps requiring log-in.Social PluginsSocial plugins are a set of embedded widgets, such as Share, Like, Comment and Follow, that allow users to access the functionality of Weibo from third-party websites and mobile apps. By installing Weibo social plugins on their websites or mobile apps, our partners enable their users to share content to Weibo, which may direct traffic of interested Weibo users back to their properties.Multimedia CardsMultimedia cards allow our mobile app partners to enable their users to share multimedia content, such as photos, songs and short videos, in a feed to Weibo. Content shared on multimedia cards is tagged and can be discovered by users who search for the tagged keywords.Weibo ServiceOur open application programming interfaces allow third-party developers to build apps to serve individual and organization users.App Application Programming InterfacesWe provide our platform partners a set of application programming interfaces that they can use to develop apps for our platform. Currently, the most popular category of these apps is Weibo games.Page App Application Programming InterfacesOur Page app application programming interfaces allow platform partners to develop apps that improve the features and functionalities of Weibo Pages. For example, an e-commerce merchant can install a Page app that enables users to view and purchase its goods on Weibo. Page apps created by platform partners are becoming increasingly popular. We allow app developers to charge for the Page apps, but we currently do not have revenue share on these appsEnterprise Application Programming InterfacesWe offer enterprise services to businesses and other organizations through enterprise application programming interfaces. For example, our enhanced messaging application programming interfaces facilitate more convenient interaction between users and their followers. Using the application programming interfaces, third-party developers enable organizations to send private bulk messages, also known as DY, to followers who have opted in to such subscriptions. For example, many followers of the China Earthquake Networks Center have subscribed for earthquake news alerts. With the DY subscription function, the Center is able to send timely earthquake news through Weibo’s messenger to all of its subscribers at once. We also provide data application programming interfaces to third-party developers for them to provide data analytics services to brands and businesses.Weibo Credit Weibo Credit allows our users to purchase in-game virtual items and other types of fee-based services on Weibo and for our platform partners to receive payment in an easy-to-use, secure and trusted environment.Weibo WalletWeibo wallet enables individuals and businesses to hand out “red envelops” to build a bigger and more active fan base.Copyright ©  Weibo Corp.

S&P 500, Nasdaq extend the July rally, retest of record highs within view
U.S. stocks are mixed early Thursday, treading water as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen concludes two days of scheduled remarks before Congress, and as second-quarter earnings season kicks in. Against this backdrop, each major U.S. benchmark has registered a month-to-date peak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has notched a record close, though by a narrow three-point margin.

Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have thus far absorbed a slight volatility uptick.  Consider that the S&P 500 has reversed respectably from first support (2,381) at this week’s low, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has concurrently maintained the 50-day moving average.

S&P 500, Nasdaq extend the July rally, retest of record highs within view
U.S. stocks are mixed early Thursday, treading water as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen concludes two days of scheduled remarks before Congress, and as second-quarter earnings season kicks in. Against this backdrop, each major U.S. benchmark has registered a month-to-date peak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has notched a record close, though by a narrow three-point margin.

Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have thus far absorbed a slight volatility uptick.  Consider that the S&P 500 has reversed respectably from first support (2,381) at this week’s low, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has concurrently maintained the 50-day moving average.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.95      Net Money Flow ($)  -1.23 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement to Alibaba of approximately $304.7 million, or
approximately $344.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional ADSs in full and without giving effect to Ali WB’s right to
acquire additional Class A ordinary shares upon the underwriters’ exercise of
their option, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to enhance our brand recognition,
retain talented employees by providing them with equity incentives, and obtain
additional capital. We will use approximately $250 million of the net proceeds
we receive from this offering to repay loans we owe to SINA, our parent company
and controlling shareholder. The loans from SINA are repayable upon demand, but
there is an understanding between us and SINA that the loans will be repaid
after the completion of this offering. The loans accrue interest at prevailing
market interest rates by reference to the three-month time deposit rate of the
People’s Bank of China, which have ranged from 2.55% to 3.05%. We intend to use
the proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares to Ali WB upon its option
exercise to repurchase certain shares and vested options held by individuals who
provided services to us. We intend to use the remainder to invest in technology,
infrastructure and product development, to expand sales and marketing efforts,
and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Additionally, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or acquire complementary
businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not have
agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions as of the date of this
prospectus. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on
the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any,
of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all. The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and
allocate the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility
and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen
event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this
offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.


We face significant competition both for the time and attention of Chinese 
internet users and for the advertising spending of companies that market to 
Chinese businesses and consumers. Social media is relatively new as a means of 
advertising and we compete for advertising budgets with a wide variety of
traditional and new media. We must compete effectively for users and for
advertising and marketing customers in order to grow our platform and increase
our revenues. We intend to continue to invest in product development, technology
infrastructure and our sales and marketing capabilities to address the
competition we face.

---

Major Chinese internet companies, including Sohu, NetEase, Tencent and Phoenix
New Media, as well as other microblogging services and new players in China who
offer online media, including content aggregation and distribution services,
compete directly with us for user traffic and user engagement, content, talent
and marketing resources. As a media platform in nature, we also compete with
offline media companies for audiences and content.

In addition, as a form of social media featuring social networking services and
messaging services, we are subject to intense competition from providers of
similar services as well as potential new types of online services, including
interest-based social products. These services include mobile applications, such
as WhatsApp, Line, Ozone, WeChat, QQ Mobile, Kakao Talk, Yixin, Laiwang, Douban
and Momo, and websites, such as renren.com. We also compete with both offline
and online games for the time and money of gamers. We have begun to offer social
commerce solutions to our customers that enable them to conduct e-commerce on
our platform. Consequently, our offerings compete with e-commerce platforms that
enable merchants to conduct e-commerce, including location-based services and
online-to-offline services. In addition to direct competition, we face indirect
competition from companies that sponsor or maintain high traffic volume websites
or provide an initial point of entry for internet users, including but not
limited to providers of search services and navigation pages, such as Baidu,
Inc. and Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd. We may also face increasing competition
from global social media and social networking services, such as Twitter and
Facebook. Some of our competitors may have substantially more cash, traffic,
technical and other resources than we do.

We also face significant competition for advertising and marketing spending. A
substantial majority of our revenues is generated from the sale of advertising
and marketing services. We compete against internet and mobile businesses that
offer such services, including Sohu, Netease, Tencent, Baidu and Youku Tudou. We
also compete against traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and
print, for advertising and marketing spending. Some of our larger competitors
have substantially broader product or service offerings and leverage their
relationships based on other products or services to gain a larger share of
advertising and marketing budgets. We believe that our ability to compete
effectively for advertising and marketing spending depends upon many factors,
including the size, composition and engagement of our user base, our ad
targeting capabilities, market acceptance of our advertising and marketing
services, our marketing and selling efforts, the return our customers receive
from our advertising and marketing services and the strength and reputation of
our brands. 

We experience significant competition for highly skilled personnel, including
management, engineers, designers and product managers. Our growth strategy
depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add
additional highly skilled employees.


Company Description
Weibo is a leading social media platform for people to create, distribute and 
discover Chinese-language content. By providing an unprecedented and simple way 
for Chinese people and organizations to publicly express themselves in real 
time, interact with others on a massive global platform and


 stay connected with 
the world, Weibo has had a profound social impact in China. 

Since our inception four years ago, Weibo has amassed a large user base in China 
and in Chinese communities in more than 190 countries. In December 2013, Weibo 
had 129.1 million monthly active users, or MAUs, and 61.4 million average daily 
active users, or average DAUs, increasing from 96.7 million MAUs and 45.1 
million average DAUs in December 2012, and 72.9 million MAUs and 25.2 million 
average DAUs in December 2011. In March 2014, Weibo had 143.8 million MAUs and 
66.6 million average DAUs, increasing from 107.3 million MAUs and 48.6 million 
average DAUs in March 2013. A microcosm of Chinese society, Weibo has attracted 
a wide range of users, including ordinary people, celebrities and other public 
figures, as well as organizations such as media outlets, businesses, government 
agencies and charities. 

Weibo represents a new online experience in China by combining the means of
real-time public self-expression with a powerful platform for social
interaction, as well as content aggregation and distribution. Any user can
create and post a feed of up to 140 Chinese characters and attach multimedia or
long-form content. User relationships on Weibo may be asymmetric; any user can
follow any other user and add comments to a feed while reposting. The simple,
asymmetric and distributed nature of Weibo allows an original feed to become a
live viral conversation stream. Over 2.8 billion feeds were shared on Weibo in
December 2013, including 2.2 billion feeds with pictures, 81.7 million feeds
with short videos and 21.5 million feeds with songs.

Weibo has become a cultural phenomenon in China. Weibo allows people to be heard
publicly and exposed to the rich ideas, cultures and experiences of the broader
world. Media outlets use Weibo as a source of news and a distribution channel
for their headline news. Government agencies and officials use Weibo as an
official communication channel for disseminating timely information and gauging
public opinion to improve public services. Individuals and charities use Weibo
to make the world a better place by launching charitable projects, seeking
donations and volunteers and leveraging the celebrities and organizations on
Weibo to amplify their social influence.

In addition to users, Weibo’s ecosystem includes customers and platform
partners:

.   Customers. We enable our advertising and marketing customers to promote   
    their brands, products and services to our users. We offer a wide range of
    advertising and marketing solutions to customers ranging from large       
    companies to small-and-medium enterprises, or SMEs, to individuals. Our   
    performance-based ads allow our customers to reach a targeted audience    
    based on the social interest graphs of our users. In addition, our        
    customers can benefit from the potentially viral effect of their promoted 
    feeds generated from the public and distributed nature of our platform,   
    commonly known as “earned media”. 

.   Platform Partners. We have attracted a large number of platform partners, 
    including media outlets and developers of games and other applications.   
    Our platform partners contribute a vast amount of content to Weibo,       
    broadly distribute Weibo content across their properties and develop      
    products and applications for our platform, enriching the experience of   
    our users while increasing our monetization opportunities.                

Designed with a “mobile first” philosophy, Weibo displays content in a simple
information feed format. With a limit of 140 Chinese characters per feed, the
high information-density of Chinese characters and users’ ability to personalize
content information flow, Weibo is particularly suited for mobile use, and we
have seen significant mobile adoption. Over 70% of our MAUs in December 2013
accessed Weibo from mobile devices at least once during the month. In the fourth
quarter of 2013, we had over 120 million check-ins where users recorded their
location by using a mobile device to post their location in a feed on Weibo.
Mobile revenues accounted for 28.0% of our advertising and marketing revenues in
2013.

We began monetization of our platform in 2012. We generate revenues primarily
from customers who purchase advertising and marketing services, and, to a lesser
extent, from platform partners who develop games for our users to play. We
provide most of our services to users free of charge, with VIP membership
services being the primary exception. In 2012 and 2013, we generated 77.4% and
78.8% of our revenues from advertising and marketing services, 19.3% and 12.2%
from game-related services, and 3.3% and 5.9% from VIP membership services,
respectively. While we distinguish between users, customers and platform
partners in classifying our products and analyzing our sources of revenues, the
same person or organization may simultaneously be included in two or more of the
categories.
