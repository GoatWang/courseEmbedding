(Bloomberg) -- One man’s junk is another man’s treasure.






That’s a credo that’s helped some of Asia’s top hedge funds this year as peers stumbled, with BFAM Partners, LIM Advisors and Serica Partners Asia surging in 2016 after snapping up or adding commodity-related bonds during a first-quarter selloff. Their performance stood out as the region’s hedge funds struggled with volatile markets in Japan and China, with offerings from Greenwoods Asset Management, Symphony Financial Partners and Tantallon Capital among those with losses.






Asia’s hedge funds are trailing global peers for the first time since 2011, threatening to further erode investor confidence amid a global backlash against lackluster performance and high fees. They’ve eked out a 0.8 percent gain in the 11 months through November, on track for the lowest annual return in five years, according to Eurekahedge data.

“The year has been characterized by a great run in credit,” said Marlon Sanchez, Deutsche Bank AG’s Hong Kong-based Asia-Pacific head of prime finance.






Among some of the top hedge funds betting on credit:






BFAM’s multistrategy Asian Opportunities Master Fund, which is expected to end the year with more than $2 billion of assets, gained 16 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the information is private. About 35 percent of its returns this year came from credit trades that include buying distressed commodity bonds in the first quarter whose values have since rebounded, said Chief Investment Officer Benjamin Fuchs, who declined to comment on returns. Other trades include the debt restructuring of Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and selling credit default swaps on embattled commodities firm Noble Group Ltd. to bearish investors in the first half. About half of its return this year came from volatility trades as event such as the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. elections added to market swings.Serica’s credit fund, run by Ivan Lee in Hong Kong, surged more than 30 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The majority of the profit came from the rebound in the value of Indonesian and resources company bonds it bought at the beginning of the year, said the person. It also made money from a number of distressed credit trades.The $304 million LIM Asia Special Situations Fund, managed by Don Ewer and Peter Warbanoff, made 10 percent after fees in the same period, said George Long, LIM’s chief investment officer. High-yield bonds, especially those in the commodity industry, recovered as the industry rebounded and as some companies refinanced their debt. It also made money from loans, including distressed ones it picked up as early as last year that have rebounded in value, said Long, whose Hong Kong-based multistrategy hedge-fund firm has $1.6 billion of assets under management. Another credit-related hedge fund that shone was OCP Asia’s about $1 billion Orchard Landmark Fund. It returned nearly 13 percent this year through November, making direct loans to small- and medium-sized companies across the Asia-Pacific region, said a person with knowledge of the matter. OCP Asia manages about $1.2 billion out of its Singapore and Hong Kong offices.






Some of this year’s best-performing large hedge funds didn’t focus on credit. Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s $3.4 billion macro fund gained about 12 percent in the 11 months, according to an estimate sent to investors. Its $721 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund, which focuses on currencies and gold and takes more concentrated bets, was up 45 percent. Bets on Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, to weaken against the dollar drove returns for both. Separately, the $296 million Credence Global Fund, a relative-value hedge fund that seeks to profit from changes in price relationships between assets, made 12 percent this year, according to an investor newsletter.






On the equity side, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average edged down 0.7 percent through November amid disillusionment with government policies to stoke growth. China funds struggled to claw back from losses after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 22 percent in January amid concerns about the country’s economic slowdown, a falling currency and regulations.






Among some of the funds with losses:






Greenwoods Asset Management’s $1.5 billion Golden China Fund is down 5.1 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Symphony Financial Partners’s SFP Value Realization Fund, which invests in Japanese companies and works with management to prompt actions such as share buybacks, is set to have its first loss since 2009. The fund fell 6 percent this year through November, according to Co-founder David Baran, who said a lot of the volatility and uncertainty that sparked market declines are “somewhat behind us.”The $24 million Tantallon Fund, which trades Asia-Pacific stocks, lost nearly 13 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund fell nearly 15 percent in March in the worst month in its 13-year history when its bearish bets on most regional indexes and bullish bets on dollar suffered, according to a newsletter posted on its website. Rega Capital Dynamic Value Fund, a long-short China hedge fund, fell 35 percent this year through Nov. 30, according to the firm.






Some equity-focused funds bucked the trend.






Ally Bridge LB Healthcare Fund, managed by Hong Kong-based former Merck & Co. scientist Li Bin, made nearly 27 percent in the first 11 months, according to an update sent to investors. The Asia-focused fund invests in mostly publicly traded stocks in the industry, targeting particularly opportunities created by Chinese medical reforms. Li researched pharmaceutical companies for Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley in New York and Hong Kong before joining Ally Bridge Group.The $68.3 million RWC Asia Opportunity Fund rose 16 percent this year, according to an e-mailed statement from London-based RWC Partners. Winning trades include Korean steelmaker Posco and Japan’s Sumco Corp., said Garret Mallal, the fund’s Singapore-based manager.United Gain Investment’s ASEAN Plus Three Segregated Portfolio, with $15 million of assets, rose 16 percent this year, said Lau Chi Yiu, chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based firm that oversees $300 million of assets. Profitable trades for the fund that focuses on Southeast Asia as well as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea included Indonesian stocks such as noodles-maker PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food Tbk and cement maker PT Semen Baturaja Persero Tbk.






Representatives from Ally Bridge, Greenwoods, Tantallon and Serica declined to comment.

        Dymon Hedge Fund’s Dollar Bet Yields Bonanza After Trump Rally

(Bloomberg) -- Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s currency hedge fund gained an estimated 22 percent in the first 25 days of November as bets on weaker Asian currencies paid off, with some investors making triple that gain by putting money into a highly leveraged version.






The profits extended returns made by the $714 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund this year to nearly 46 percent, said Gerald Chan, the firm’s Singapore-based head of distribution, citing estimates. The money manager’s $3.4 billion flagship Dymon Asia Macro Fund made an estimated 7.8 percent during the same period in November, taking this year’s return to 12 percent, he said.






Dymon joins macro hedge-fund peers such as Brevan Howard Asset Management and Rubicon Fund Management in turning a political shock into profit. Brevan Howard’s $12.7 billion main hedge fund gained 5.6 percent in the first 18 days of November, erasing earlier losses this year, and Rubicon surged almost 20 percent in the same period to return to profit.






The November returns for Dymon came primarily thanks to bearish bets on various Asian currencies, including the Japanese yen, against the greenback, said Chan. The dollar has surged for its biggest monthly gain versus the yen since 1995, on the prospect of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal stimulus fueling inflation. The dollar gained 9.1 percent against the Japanese currency last month.






‘Critical Component’






“A critical component of the performance was the portfolio construction going into the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8,” Chan said. “The portfolio was constructed with one express objective: enabling Dymon Asia Macro Fund to navigate through the anticipated volatility, allowing the fund to stay with its high-conviction short Asian currencies, long U.S. dollar positions.”






Danny Yong, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citadel trader, started Dymon Asia Macro Fund with $113 million in 2008, with billionaire-investor Paul Tudor Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp. as his first outside backer. He is the lone manager of the Dymon currency fund.






Yong said he continues to remain bearish on Asian currencies and bullish on the dollar, a view Dymon has held for most of this year, as global trade continues to slow. While the election of either candidate would have led to different degrees of fiscal expansion, the Trump victory is expected to result in robust fiscal stimulus and “U.S.-centric policies,” he said.






“This backdrop provides an attractive trading environment for macro strategies as the market digests the full impact of the massive structural changes ahead,” Yong said, citing an uncertain impact on Asia and the rest of the world.






Concentrated Bets






Macro hedge funds seek to profit from broad economic trends by trading in markets including currencies, interest rates, credit, stocks and commodities. Dymon’s currency fund takes more concentrated bets, focuses on currencies and gold and has less risk constraint than its bigger macro fund.






The Dymon funds entered the month with bearish positions on Asian currencies and bullish bets on gold. They used option trades to allow them to minimize losses should the firm’s views turn out wrong, while enabling them to make outsize gains should their positions be validated by markets. With that, they weathered a rally in the yen as the election outcome crystallized and profited when it reversed course.






The funds also profited from short-term trading and risk management moves as the markets whipsawed on election day. The main macro fund gained 2.4 percent on Nov. 9 by the time the New York markets closed as the yen rally earlier in the day was erased, said Chan.






Dymon switched from a bullish bet on yen to a bearish wager between August and September, after the Bank of Japan indicated that it would seek to steepen the yield curve, said Yong. He cited this as evidence of the government’s intent to remedy the adverse effects of its surprise announcement of negative interest rates in January. Dymon also believed the Japanese currency had become too expensive by August after strengthening more than 20 percent against yuan and the dollar.






Dymon plans to stop taking additional money for the macro fund when its assets hit $4.5 billion, said Chan. It will also cease accepting fresh capital for the currency fund when it hits $1.5 billion, he added.

The man behind Dymon’s stellar rise

Friday, January 9, 2015
When Mr Danny Yong started what is now Dymon Asia Macro Fund with US$113 million in 2008, billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones’ hedge fund company was his first outside backer.
Six years later, Mr Yong’s one-time upstart has grown to US$3.5 billion (S$4.7 billion) in assets and delivered the second-best performance of any large Asia-based hedge fund, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its February issue.
From its perch in Singapore, Dymon Asia Macro returned 17 per cent in the first 10 months of last year. Only the Quantedge Global Fund’s 32.3 per cent topped it in Asia in Bloomberg Markets’ annual ranking of funds with US$1 billion or more in assets.
Dymon was also a standout worldwide. It came in at No. 10 among all large funds in a bad year for some macro funds, which seek to profit from trends in currencies, interest rates, and equities and commodities markets.
Managers of big Asia-focused funds can struggle to deliver consistent gains. Markets are smaller and less liquid than those in the US and Europe, and there is a limited pool of talented professionals to run the funds. Mr Yong, 43, who has a resume that includes Goldman Sachs Group, has 18 years of experience trading Asian securities.
Dymon Asia Macro returned 82.1 per cent from August 2008 through last October, according to a source. That compares with a 16 per cent loss for the HFRX Macro/CTA Index, which measures macro hedge funds and the so-called commodity-trading advisers that trade futures and forward contracts on commodities, financial assets and currencies.
The Dymon fund’s only calendar- year loss was for its inaugural five months in 2008.
In 2011, Dymon Asia Macro topped all US$1 billion–plus Asian funds, with a return of more than 20 per cent after fees.
“Dymon, over the years, demonstrated strong risk management,” says Mr Stephane Pizzo, managing partner of Singapore-based Lotus Peak Capital, which invests in hedge funds. “This allows them to limit losses during quiet months, while fully participating when the move finally happens.”
Dymon Asia Macro took advantage of the lull in major market moves during the first half of last year, says Mr David Chan, chief executive of Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore), the management firm that oversees US$4.4 billion of assets, including the macro fund.
He says the fund bought cheap options to benefit from trends it expected to crystallise in later months. One of the most profitable bets was on China’s yuan. The currency had dropped 3 per cent against the US dollar in trading outside China in the first four months.
Mr Yong says he expected the yuan would rebound and finish the year roughly where it started. Dymon bought call options, which gave it the right to buy the yuan at a specified price during a specified period. The currency strengthened 2 per cent from April to the end of October in trading outside of China.
“Since the global financial crisis, market cycles have shortened and trends are often interspersed with violent corrections that make holding on to long-term positions more challenging,” says Mr Yong, who is also chief investment officer of Dymon Asia Capital. “Using options has allowed us to structure trades with compelling risk-reward profiles and allows us to generate superior returns when we call the market right.”
The US Federal Reserve handed hedge funds last year’s most anticipated trading catalyst. The central bank announced in late October that it would end the asset buying that underpinned its third round of quantitative easing. The Fed’s purchases were designed to boost economic growth and investor confidence.
Unlike some peers who bet Treasury bond prices would decline as a result, Mr Yong sought to gain from a stronger US economy by going long on the US dollar against the Japanese yen.
The strategy had two benefits: It shielded Dymon investors from the largest one-day decline since 2009 in US Treasury yields on Oct 15, a drop that reversed in the following days. It also allowed Dymon to profit from additional stimulus moves and pension reforms Mr Yong says he expected would lead Japan’s currency lower.
Dymon boosted the size of its bet against the yen, convinced the Japanese economy was running out of steam. From Aug 13, the day the second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) number was announced, through Oct 31, the US dollar strengthened 9.7 per cent against Japan’s currency. It had extended the gain by a further 6.6 per cent as of the end of last month, after the Bank of Japan decided to expand the stimulus in late October. On Nov 17, the country announced it had slipped back into recession in the third quarter.
Mr Yong has lived through plenty of Asia’s turmoil in a 20-year career. He joined what is now JPMorgan Chase & Co as a trader on the Asian markets-derivatives and fixed-income desk in 1997, just months before the region’s financial crisis.
He moved to Goldman Sachs’ Hong Kong derivatives trading desk in 2000, then spent 2 1/2 years with the firm in Japan. In 2005, Citadel hired him to set up and run Asian currencies, interest-rates, relative-value and macro trading in Hong Kong for the Chicago-based firm.

Yasmine YahyaAssistant Business Editor yasminey@sph.com.sg

They run an investment firm managing US$6 billion (S$8 billion) for major pension funds, asset managers and sovereign wealth funds, including Temasek Holdings, and their funds have been ranked among the best-performing hedge funds in the world.
But up close and personal, Mr Keith Tan and Mr Danny Yong, both 45, the founders of Dymon Asia, are still two university buddies who can barely believe their luck.
Anyone else would be happy to crow about how their own genius and hard work helped them build one of Singapore's most successful home-grown finance firms.





Mr Tan and Mr Yong keep bringing up the importance of luck and gratitude in their success story.
Take Mr Tan, whose parents were vegetable sellers and who grew up playing at the Geylang Serai wet market.
He recently participated in a survey on entrepreneurship. One of the questions asked him to rank, on a scale of one to 10, what kind of cards he was dealt at birth.






PLAYING TO DIFFERENT STRENGTHS
We focus on two extreme ends of investing – in our private equity business, Keith has an in-depth understanding of entrepreneurs and individual companies that we invest in, while I assess global events and
anticipate macroeconomic trends across the world to make top-down macro investments. ’’
MR DANNY YONG, referring to Mr Keith Tan. They are the founders of Dymon Asia.

"Considering my family's humble background, maybe most people's immediate reactions were to put down three or four, but mine was a definite 10," he says.
 "I might not have been given a very good financial head start, but since I was young, I saw how my parents worked. They didn't bring home a huge amount of money but they taught me how, with your bare pair of hands and the willingness to work hard, you can make a decent and honest living. No amount of money could have bought this kind of head start in life, and this has guided the way I have approached life since I was young."
Mr Yong grew up the youngest of three under the care of a single mother, a nurse, after his father died when he was 10.
"It forged my mindset. We were living off my mum's salary. We got by. I didn't feel poor, although I felt I was missing a father figure," he recalls. "But my mum always told me not to let anyone look down on me. Hence, I was always very competitive from a young age. Those early days drilled into my head that I needed to work hard so people wouldn't look down on me."
That competitive streak was what brought the two friends together at Nanyang Technological University.
Mr Yong says: "He played basketball and handball for his hall and I played badminton and handball for mine. So we started off as rivals, where he was the guy that, at times, contributed to beating my hall at basketball and handball.  So I didn't like him as I didn't like to lose.
"But in our second year, we ended up taking the same class and we got to know each other. My respect for Keith grew, so much so that before we graduated, I told him, 'If one day you start a business and you don't involve me, I'll punch you!'"
After graduation, the two pursued separate careers. Mr Yong was a trader at JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Citadel Investment Asia, while Mr Tan's resume includes heading the small and medium-sized enterprise lending team at Standard Chartered and then later being appointed the branch manager of its Shanghai office and a member of Standard Chartered's China executive committee.
In 2007, the good friends reunited. Mr Yong and some former colleagues at Citadel founded their own hedge fund called Abax Global Capital in Hong Kong, and Mr Yong immediately seized the opportunity to call upon his friend, Mr Tan.
In 2008, the two decided to go home to Singapore and start their own firm in Dymon Asia Capital and launch what would evolve into today's flagship product, the Dymon Asia Macro Fund, as well as establish a successful private equity business, Dymon Asia Private Equity.
"We focus on two extreme ends of investing - in our private equity business, Keith has an in-depth understanding of entrepreneurs and individual companies that we invest in, while I assess global events and anticipate macroeconomic trends across the world to make top-down macro investments," Mr Yong says. "We were very, very fortunate that Paul Tudor Jones, a legend in the hedge fund industry, agreed to give us US$100 million seed funding in August 2008."
The following month, investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, sparking off the financial crisis.
"Whilst we were unlucky that we launched just as the financial world was melting down, we were, at the same time, very fortunate that we managed to start our hedge fund.
"Frankly, had the US$100 million seed investment been delayed by even one month, it would have been cancelled, and hence, likely that Dymon Asia would not be in existence today. You must be passionate and good at what you do, and work extremely hard. But you also need some luck sometimes, in order to succeed," Mr Yong adds.
What is lucky, too, is that the two friends have managed to strengthen their friendship through the firm's highs and lows.
In January 2015, the fund was negatively impacted from exposure to the Swiss franc, when the Swiss central bank made the unexpected decision to depeg it from the euro. After the losses, Mr Yong and Mr Tan made a choice which they felt was the right thing to do.
They proactively rebated a portion of the fees they received from their strong performance in 2014 back to their investors for the loss in 2015. Investors applauded the decision and many commended the organisation for its alignment of interest with investors, which was uncommon in the industry.
"We didn't do it for the praise, we just felt it was the right thing to do," Mr Yong says.
Even employees applauded the decision. When the company carried out an anonymous survey to gauge staff satisfaction, one of the questions asked what made them proud to work for Dymon, and many cited this particular move as a factor.
Through the ups and downs, the firm has chalked up a series of impressive feats.
Last year, its Dymon Asia Macro Fund was the 35th best performing fund in the world, among funds that have over US$1 billion in assets and fifth within the macro strategy category. In 2011 and 2014, this same fund was within the top 10 performing large hedge funds in the world.
There are no similar global rankings for private equity, but the close to 40 per cent annual net returns that the business rakes in for clients is likely among the top 25 per cent in the world for performance.
The year before, that same fund was the 10 best performer in the world run by a large hedge fund.
Along the way, assets under management have ballooned from US$113 million at the firm's founding to approximately US$6 billion today. Besides the Dymon Asia Macro Fund and Dymon Asia Private Equity Fund, other funds within the firm include Dymon Asia Ventures and Dymon Asia Manager Solutions, which was seeded by Temasek Holdings in 2014.
The two friends' shared values carry over into their philanthropic work. Mr Tan sits on the main committee of the Yellow Ribbon Fund, part of the Yellow Ribbon Project that supports former offenders to reintegrate into society.
Mr Yong, meanwhile, set up a foundation to help children from challenging family backgrounds and The Ray of Hope Initiative, a non-profit organisation that uses crowdfunding to help donors get their money to those who need help, with an emphasis on accountability to donors.
The two are also working on a new TRY initiative, which aims to get organisations to hire more non-graduates, even school dropouts, as apprentices who can learn on the job and work their way up.
"Just three decades ago, it was common for non-graduates to work in finance. There were many stories of people who started in the mail room but worked their way up to become star traders and legendary investors," Mr Yong says.
"But now, it's so rare across all industries. Organisations find it easy to hire graduates with first-class honours from Ivy League universities. Why look through the haystack for hidden talent?"
Again, it all boils down to their belief that luck got them to where they are today, and wanting to help others achieve the same success.
Mr Yong notes: "Honestly, how much of what you know today you learnt on the job? Most people would say over 90 per cent of their skills were learnt on the job. So if you find a bunch of people who are curious, hungry to learn, driven, street smart or have decent EQ, if you give them an opportunity to learn by throwing them in the deep end, could some of them evolve into superstars too?
"We believe that when someone possesses certain personality traits and a strong desire to succeed, if given an opportunity to learn on the job, many can excel professionally, with or without a university degree. The requisite traits differ for different industries."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Singapore-based Dymon Asia Capital Ltd. ended the first quarter with a sharp decline in its largest hedge fund, a bruising performance for one of Asia’s biggest managers but also a quick turnaround from heavy losses suffered earlier in the year.  The Dymon Asia Macro Fund is down 5.5% after fees through March, according to a letter sent to investors this week and seen by The Wall Street Journal. The fund slid 10.5% in January, one of many around the world to be rocked by the Swiss National Bank’s shocking decision to...
