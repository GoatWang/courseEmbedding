One Team. A World of Opportunity.

As one of the world’s largest and most active venture capital firms, NEA has developed deep domain expertise and insight into our industries of focus.  We channel that knowledge into every technology and healthcare investment we make -- at any stage, in any location, around the globe. 













In Key Industries

Across our portfolio, visionary entrepreneurs are at the helm of current and future industry leaders, fueling the development of technologies that will keep the U.S. at the forefront of innovation. Some of the most successful business leaders in each of these industries have joined forces with NEA as Venture Partners, bringing tremendous sector insight and deep networks.





Technology




We’ve built a premier IT franchise by fueling the growth of disruptive technologies and market leaders across several key sectors, including electronics, consumer technology, enterprise mobility, virtualization, tech-enabled services, SaaS and cloud computing.


View Technology




Healthcare




With a focus on biopharmaceuticals, healthcare services/IT and medical devices, we have long track record of partnering with companies that have pioneered transformative innovations in healthcare, such as balloon angioplasty and laparoscopic surgery.

Across All Stages










NEA’s proven investment strategy spans all stages of a company's growth, from seeding innovations in emerging markets to funding early-stage companies in high-growth markets to fueling the growth of market leaders. Any stage of growth is the right stage to partner with NEA. We can add value and offer expert guidance throughout your company’s lifecycle—whether your big idea is at its inception or has already progressed to be a viable reality.






At A Global Scale

The last two decades have marked the largest expansion of the global economy the world has ever seen, with more than half of the expansion attributable to emerging economies. With bi-coastal U.S. operations and a growing international presence, NEA stays on the cutting edge of new technologies as we expand our global network.

Growing up on Both Coasts

More than 35 years ago, our founders formed the industry’s first truly bi-coastal firm. Our US presence has grown to include offices in Menlo Park, Washington, DC, New York and Chicago. This enables NEA to find the best opportunities at the source of innovation, and to build a vast network of resources and expertise from coast to coast.





Thinking Globally

NEA actively invests in emerging markets, particularly in India and China, and is continuously expanding our global network to benefit companies in our portfolio--many of which are operating internationally from the earliest stages. Today our investing activities span six continents, and we think the world seems a little flatter every day.








Key Benefits




Network
People are the driving force behind every successful business--including ours. This is what 'value add' means.



Deep roots and strong ties matter, and partnering with NEA means joining a thriving network of business leaders, successful entrepreneurs, technologists, vendors and potential customers. Entrepreneurs often tell us that our network is even more valuable than the capital we invest. We're committed to making sure that's the case.





Scale
Over 35 years, $17 Billion and more than 500 liquidity events, we've learned that size does have its advantages. 



We use ours to create a global platform that gives us the insight, the flexibility and the efficiency to invest in big ideas--no matter where they are, or how far along they might be. Our scale enables us to seed innovations in emerging markets, fund early-stage companies in high-growth sectors, and fuel the growth of market leaders.





Depth
We are investors... and operators, technologists and entrepreneurs. We really do know it when we see it.   



Nobody ever said sourcing innovation, spotting big market opportunities and building great businesses was easy--it's not! And doing it well for nearly four decades is no fluke. By combining deep sector knowledge, a collaborative team structure, and the broad perspective scale brings, we show up early, dive deep and make things happen.

United States

Geographic diversity has long been a hallmark of NEA, founded on both U.S. coasts in 1977 and still deeply rooted in Silicon Valley and the Mid-Atlantic. Ask someone where NEA is headquartered, and you'll see how ingrained that dual citizenship is--they'll think about it for a minute, and then either admit they don't know or err on the side of their home office. It makes for some fierce sports rivalries, but it also makes us better investors. We have cross-functional, cross-country collaboration down to such a science it's bordering on art. We want to find and fund innovation at its source, and innovation is everywhere. That pursuit of innovation and great partnerships has led us to spend a lot more time in certain hubs, and over the last few years NEA has established small offices in New York and Chicago.




Menlo Park

Innovation is everywhere, but Silicon Valley is still the undisputed hub of the venture capital and startup ecosystems--and few would dispute that Sand Hill Road is to venture capital what Wall Street is to the stock markets. NEA's founding West Coast office was in San Francisco, and while we're active up and down the west coast, Sand Hill Road has been home since the mid-80s.




Washington, DC

NEA's East Coast roots are spread across the metropolitan DC region, with a founding office in Baltimore and a second location in Virginia. Our dual residency came to an end in 2007, when our East Coast investing staff moved into our current Friendship Heights location. Our operations team has stayed close to the firm's Baltimore roots with an office in nearby Timonium.






San Francisco

In 2016 we harkened back to our city roots and opened an office in San Francisco. The office is located in the South Park neighborhood—a  recognized startup and VC mecca in the area. The space is designed as collaborative and approachable work environment that serves as a landing place for NEA team members, and also provides us with an awesome spot to host meetings and events.




New York

In recent years, we've been spending more and more time in New York. The region's vibrant startup ecosystem, coupled with top tech and design talent, has made it a hub for digital media and consumer internet companies. We occupied office space in 2011, and earlier this year we launched NEA Studio to support entrepreneurial designers as they make the leap to company formation and funding.






Boston

Boston has undoubtably established itself as a force within the innovation ecosystem. We have a history of partnering with New England-based startups, and currently have over two dozen active portfolio companies in Boston and surrounding areas. In 2013, we decided to formalize our relationship with the city by opening an office in the Cambridge biopharma hub, Kendall Square.




Chicago

Our portfolio spans six continents, but we have invested more capital in Chicago than in any other municipality outside of Silicon Valley. We like Chicago's unique entrepreneurial spirit--the blend of midwest sensibilities and leading edge tech that has transformed legacy industries like printing and logistics. To better serve our local portfolio, we opened a small office here in 2012.

Description[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and Washington, D.C.,[3] and has additional offices in Baltimore, Bangalore, Beijing, Boston, Mumbai, New York City, San Francisco and Shanghai.[6]
Since its founding, NEA invested in over 650 companies, and realized nearly 500 liquidity events (with close to 200 portfolio company IPOs and 300 portfolio company acquisitions),[2] making NEA one of the most prolific and successful venture capital firms.
NEA firm was founded in 1977 by C. Richard (Dick) Kramlich, Chuck Newhall and Frank Bonsal.[7] Kramlich had worked with noted venture capitalist Arthur Rock beginning 1969 and Frank Bosnal had been an investment banker at Alex. Brown & Sons where he focused on initial public offerings (IPOs) for startup companies.[7] Chuck Newhall had previously managed an investment fund for T. Rowe Price in the 1970s. The firm was founded with offices on both the East Coast and the West Coast. Among the firm's first investments was 3Com, which NEA backed along with Mayfield Fund and Jack Melchor in 1981.[8]
The first NEA investment fund had only $16 million of capital. The firm's second fund raised $45 million and the third fund collected $125 million of commitments from investors in 1984. The firm continued to grow steadily throughout the 1980s and early 1990s raising $900 million from 1987 through 1996 across NEA's next four funds.[7] Beginning with NEA-8 in 1998, the firm greatly increased the size of its investment funds. NEA's tenth fund had $2.3 billion of investor commitments in 2000. After raising a more modest $1.1 billion in 2004 for the firm's eleventh fund, NEA was able to raise $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for its next two funds, respectively.[9][10] In 2010, NEA launched its thirteenth investment fund with $2.5 billion of investor capital, the largest since the Financial crisis of 2007–08.[11] In 2012, NEA closed its fourteenth investment fund with $2.6 billion of investor capital.[2][5] In April 2015, NEA closed its fifteenth investment fund with $3.1 billion in investor capital - the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[12]
Investments[edit]
The firm's investments include 3com, Appian, Bloom Energy, Braintree, Boingo Wireless, Box, CareerBuilder, Climate Corporation, Cloudflare, Coursera, Cvent, Diapers.com, Duolingo, Forter, Fusion-io, Groupon, Gilt Groupe, Global Savings Group, Houzz, Juniper Networks, The Learning Company, Lot18, Macromedia, MapD Technologies, MongoDB, MuleSoft, Nicira, Opower, Pentaho, Raise Marketplace, Salesforce.com, ScienceLogic, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Spreadtrum, Swiftype, Tableau Software, TiVo, Topera Medical, Vonage, WebMD, Workday, and ZeroFOX.[13]

Description[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and Washington, D.C.,[3] and has additional offices in Baltimore, Bangalore, Beijing, Boston, Mumbai, New York City, San Francisco and Shanghai.[6]
Since its founding, NEA invested in over 650 companies, and realized nearly 500 liquidity events (with close to 200 portfolio company IPOs and 300 portfolio company acquisitions),[2] making NEA one of the most prolific and successful venture capital firms.
NEA firm was founded in 1977 by C. Richard (Dick) Kramlich, Chuck Newhall and Frank Bonsal.[7] Kramlich had worked with noted venture capitalist Arthur Rock beginning 1969 and Frank Bosnal had been an investment banker at Alex. Brown & Sons where he focused on initial public offerings (IPOs) for startup companies.[7] Chuck Newhall had previously managed an investment fund for T. Rowe Price in the 1970s. The firm was founded with offices on both the East Coast and the West Coast. Among the firm's first investments was 3Com, which NEA backed along with Mayfield Fund and Jack Melchor in 1981.[8]
The first NEA investment fund had only $16 million of capital. The firm's second fund raised $45 million and the third fund collected $125 million of commitments from investors in 1984. The firm continued to grow steadily throughout the 1980s and early 1990s raising $900 million from 1987 through 1996 across NEA's next four funds.[7] Beginning with NEA-8 in 1998, the firm greatly increased the size of its investment funds. NEA's tenth fund had $2.3 billion of investor commitments in 2000. After raising a more modest $1.1 billion in 2004 for the firm's eleventh fund, NEA was able to raise $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for its next two funds, respectively.[9][10] In 2010, NEA launched its thirteenth investment fund with $2.5 billion of investor capital, the largest since the Financial crisis of 2007–08.[11] In 2012, NEA closed its fourteenth investment fund with $2.6 billion of investor capital.[2][5] In April 2015, NEA closed its fifteenth investment fund with $3.1 billion in investor capital - the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[12]
Investments[edit]
The firm's investments include 3com, Appian, Bloom Energy, Braintree, Boingo Wireless, Box, CareerBuilder, Climate Corporation, Cloudflare, Coursera, Cvent, Diapers.com, Duolingo, Forter, Fusion-io, Groupon, Gilt Groupe, Global Savings Group, Houzz, Juniper Networks, The Learning Company, Lot18, Macromedia, MapD Technologies, MongoDB, MuleSoft, Nicira, Opower, Pentaho, Raise Marketplace, Salesforce.com, ScienceLogic, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Spreadtrum, Swiftype, Tableau Software, TiVo, Topera Medical, Vonage, WebMD, Workday, and ZeroFOX.[13]

Description[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and Washington, D.C.,[3] and has additional offices in Baltimore, Bangalore, Beijing, Boston, Mumbai, New York City, San Francisco and Shanghai.[6]
Since its founding, NEA invested in over 650 companies, and realized nearly 500 liquidity events (with close to 200 portfolio company IPOs and 300 portfolio company acquisitions),[2] making NEA one of the most prolific and successful venture capital firms.
NEA firm was founded in 1977 by C. Richard (Dick) Kramlich, Chuck Newhall and Frank Bonsal.[7] Kramlich had worked with noted venture capitalist Arthur Rock beginning 1969 and Frank Bosnal had been an investment banker at Alex. Brown & Sons where he focused on initial public offerings (IPOs) for startup companies.[7] Chuck Newhall had previously managed an investment fund for T. Rowe Price in the 1970s. The firm was founded with offices on both the East Coast and the West Coast. Among the firm's first investments was 3Com, which NEA backed along with Mayfield Fund and Jack Melchor in 1981.[8]
The first NEA investment fund had only $16 million of capital. The firm's second fund raised $45 million and the third fund collected $125 million of commitments from investors in 1984. The firm continued to grow steadily throughout the 1980s and early 1990s raising $900 million from 1987 through 1996 across NEA's next four funds.[7] Beginning with NEA-8 in 1998, the firm greatly increased the size of its investment funds. NEA's tenth fund had $2.3 billion of investor commitments in 2000. After raising a more modest $1.1 billion in 2004 for the firm's eleventh fund, NEA was able to raise $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for its next two funds, respectively.[9][10] In 2010, NEA launched its thirteenth investment fund with $2.5 billion of investor capital, the largest since the Financial crisis of 2007–08.[11] In 2012, NEA closed its fourteenth investment fund with $2.6 billion of investor capital.[2][5] In April 2015, NEA closed its fifteenth investment fund with $3.1 billion in investor capital - the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[12]
Investments[edit]
The firm's investments include 3com, Appian, Bloom Energy, Braintree, Boingo Wireless, Box, CareerBuilder, Climate Corporation, Cloudflare, Coursera, Cvent, Diapers.com, Duolingo, Forter, Fusion-io, Groupon, Gilt Groupe, Global Savings Group, Houzz, Juniper Networks, The Learning Company, Lot18, Macromedia, MapD Technologies, MongoDB, MuleSoft, Nicira, Opower, Pentaho, Raise Marketplace, Salesforce.com, ScienceLogic, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Spreadtrum, Swiftype, Tableau Software, TiVo, Topera Medical, Vonage, WebMD, Workday, and ZeroFOX.[13]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
