RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation (RXi) is a development-stage company. The Company is a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing therapies addressing medical needs using Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA) interference (RNAi)-targeted technologies. The Company’s proprietary therapeutic platform is consists of RNAi compounds, referred to as rxRNA compounds. These RNAi compounds include rxRNAori and sd-rxRNA. RXI-109 is the clinical product used for the reduction of dermal scarring. RNAi is a naturally occurring phenomenon where short, double-stranded RNA molecules interfere with the expression of targeted genes. RNAi technology takes advantage of this phenomenon and potentially allows to interfere with particular genes within living cells by designing RNA-derived molecules targeting those genes.
