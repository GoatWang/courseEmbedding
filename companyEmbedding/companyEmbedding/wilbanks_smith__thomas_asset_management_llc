Offering Day Passes
Scale your support without burning holes in your pocket
The next time you need a couple of extra hands on high-traffic support days or before any D-day, simply use day passes by Freshservice to temporarily add extra agents whenever you need them. You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

Whoa there!

			Looking for some fine-print stuff? You know, the kind where we talk about how much we'll charge you for all the other teensy-weensy things you'll need to add with us a la carte?
		

Sorry, there isn’t really anything here.


			We are customers too, and boy, do we HATE guys that nickel-and-dime...
		

			So with Freshservice, you pay for exactly what you sign up for and that’s that. No extras, no under-the-rug, no balderdash...
