History[edit]
The Ritchie Brothers[edit]
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers was established in Kelowna, B.C., Canada. The three Ritchie brothers – Ken, John and Dave Ritchie – took over the OK Used Furniture Store from their father in 1955. They entered the auction business in 1958 when they needed CA$2,000 to pay a bank debt on short notice. A friend suggested they conduct an auction to get rid of some surplus inventory from the furniture store. They conducted their first auction at the Scout Hall in Kelowna in 1958 and discovered a new way of doing business.[2]
Starting with that first auction at the Scout Hall, Ritchie Bros. maintained a strict policy of conducting unreserved auctions – meaning there were no minimum bids and no reserve prices. The brothers also established a policy of not allowing bid-ins or buybacks by the sellers.[3]
The brothers began conducting auctions more regularly and in 1958 incorporated Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to formalize their new business.[4] Ritchie Bros. began selling used equipment in the 1960s. In 1963 Dave Ritchie moved to Vancouver, B.C. and rented an auction site on S.E. Marine Drive. He set up the company's first equipment auction in Vancouver shortly after.[5]
The Ritchie brothers conducted their first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia on June 7, 1963. They sold CA$663,000 of equipment in one day – by far the largest auction in the company's history.[6]
The success of the Radium Hot Springs auction convinced the brothers that they could make more money auctioning used equipment than selling furniture, so they sold their furniture store in Kelowna and went into the auction business full-time.[7]
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers established one of the trademarks of its auctions at the Radium Hot Springs auction. It was raining on the day of the auction. Instead of making the bidders walk around in the rain during the auction, they set up the auction under the eaves of a nearby shop and drove the equipment in to be sold piece by piece. The crowd stayed dry and the ramp-and-stage method became a fixture at Ritchie Bros. auctions thereafter.[8]
50 years of unreserved industrial auctions[edit]
On June 7, 2013, Ritchie Bros. celebrated 50 years since the company’s first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia. It was at this Radium Hot Springs auction that Ritchie Bros. adopted the ramp-and-stage approach for selling all mobile equipment. This approach involves a staging area —designed as a ramp— located in front of a viewing theater, where bidders sit waiting for mobile equipment to come to “center stage.” Each piece of equipment is numbered and, once it comes to rest at the center of the ramp, the auctioneer begins asking for bids. The crowd of bidders signals their bid increments to roving “bid catchers,” who in turn signal the auctioneer when a bid is made. The auctioneer increases the call price until there are no more bids being placed. At a Ritchie Bros. auction, bids are called until no more are forthcoming in approximately one minute, when the auctioneer calls that the item has been “sold!” to the highest bidder.
The Company has pioneered the ramp-and-stage method and unreserved industrial auctions around the world ever since the auction at Radium Hot Springs on June 7, 1963.
The early auction years[edit]
Most of the company's earliest auctions were held in British Columbia. Ritchie Bros. began expanding into other parts of Canada in the mid-1960s, conducting its first auctions in Alberta (in 1964), the Yukon (1964), Saskatchewan (1965), Manitoba (1968), and other parts of Eastern Canada shortly thereafter.[9]
In 1965, Ken Ritchie left the company to spend more time with his family and the company’s name was changed from Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Ltd.[10] Ken established his own auction company, but returned to work with his brothers in 1968. He stayed with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers until 1980.[11]
In 1968, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers held its first auction with gross proceeds in excess of CA$1 million, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.[12] Edmonton was also the site of the company’s first permanent auction site (on company-owned land), which was established in 1976. Until then, Ritchie Bros. had been conducting its auctions on leased land.[13]
Expansion in the U.S.[edit]
Ritchie Bros. established its first presence outside Canada in 1969 when it became incorporated in Washington, USA.[14] The company held its first auction outside Canada in 1970, in Beaverton, Oregon, and gradually began expanding throughout the United States.[13]
In 1974, John Ritchie left the company, selling his share of the business to his brother Dave. In 1975, Dave Ritchie – the sole company shareholder – decided to sell partnerships in Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers to some of his key employees: Dick Bartel, C. Russell (“Russ”) Cmolik, Ken Ritchie, and Bill Gronberg.[15] Over the coming years, the partnership expanded to include Bob Carswell, Marvin Chantler, Ed Banser, Roger Rummel, Bob Brawley, Ken Asbury, John Wild, Marty Pope, Mark Clarke, Don Chalmers, Sylvain Touchette, Frank McFadden, and Mike Ritchie.[16] When Ritchie Bros. went public in 1998, Ken Ritchie and Bill Gronberg no longer owned shares in the company.
By 1985, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers had sold more than US$1 billion of equipment through unreserved auctions. It took only three more years for the company to gross another US$1 billion in sales.[13]
International expansion[edit]
In the late 1980s Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers began to look overseas for further growth opportunities. The company conducted its first auctions outside North America in 1987, in Liverpool, the U.K., and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The equipment sold at the Liverpool auction had been used to rebuild the Falkland Islands following the war there.[17] Further international expansion followed with the company's first auctions in Australia (1990), Mexico (1995), the Middle East (1997), Africa (2003), China (2013), and Finland (2013).[13]
In 1991, the company achieved another milestone when it conducted its 1,000th unreserved auction. It conducted its 2,000th auction in the year 2000.[13]
The role of technology[edit]
In 1989, Ritchie Bros. became the first industrial auction company to enable remote bidding via video when it broadcast its Edmonton auction live at the Agricom trade show in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Video simulcasts were held at trade shows in 1993 and 1995, followed in 1997 by a three-way videoconferenced auction that linked separate auction sites in St. Paul, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; and Clinton, Wisconsin. Equipment was located at all three sites, and interested buyers could bid at any of the sites, which were linked via video.[18]
The company launched its website, rbauction.com, at the ConExpo trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in 1996. The site featured a searchable database that enabled customers to see all of the equipment being sold in upcoming Ritchie Bros. auctions.[19]
In March 1999, Ritchie Bros. broadcast an auction over the Internet for the first time.[20] In March 2002, Ritchie Bros. introduced its real-time Internet bidding service, rbauctionBid-Live.[21]
 On September 22, 2008, Ritchie Bros. launched a comprehensive online resource tool for the construction, mining, transportation, agricultural and forestry industries at MINExpo International in Las Vegas. The tool is called RitchieWiki and is associated with an equipment specification engine called RitchieSpecs.
Going public[edit]
In 1998, the year that Ritchie Bros. went public, the company’s annual gross auction proceeds exceeded US$1 billion for the first time ever.[22] Its common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBA in March 1998, followed by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April 2004.[23]
Network of auction sites[edit]
Investing in permanent auction sites has been a company priority since the 1970s. Ritchie Bros. opened its first permanent auction site in Nisku (Edmonton), Alberta, Canada in 1976. Before going public in 1998, the company opened additional permanent auction sites in Vancouver, B.C. (in 1979); Prince George, B.C. (1980); Denver, Colorado (1985) – the first site in the U.S.; Phoenix, Arizona (1987); Toronto, Ontario (1988); Tampa, Florida (1995); Atlanta, Georgia (1996); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1991); Houston, Texas (1993); Fort Worth, Texas (1994); Olympia, Washington (1994); and Halifax, Nova Scotia (1997).[24]
Since then, Ritchie Bros. has added auction sites in eight other countries. Today, the company has 44 auction sites in 13 countries worldwide:[25]

USA: Albuquerque, NM; Atlanta, GA; Chicago, IL; Chehalis, WA; Columbus, OH; Denver, CO; Fort Worth, TX; Manchester, NH; Houston, TX; Kansas City, MO; Las Vegas, NV; Los Angeles, CA; Minneapolis, MN; Nashville, TN; North East, MD; Orlando, FL; Phoenix, AZ; Sacramento, CA; Salt Lake City, UT; Raleigh-Durham, NC; St. Louis, MO; Tipton, CA

Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Ritchie Bros. acquired Forke Brothers, an equipment auction company based in Nebraska, USA and one of its major competitors. The company moved its U.S. headquarters to Lincoln, Nebraska following the acquisition.[26] Ritchie Bros. made its foray into the agricultural equipment auction business with the acquisitions of All Peace Auctions of Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada in 2002; LeBlanc Auction Service of Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2004;[27] Dennis Biliske Auctioneers of Buxton, North Dakota, USA in 2006; Clarke Auctioneers of Rouleau, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2007;[28] and Martella Auction Company of Tipton, CA in 2009.[29]
Notable auctions[edit]
Among the notable auctions conducted by Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers: construction and other equipment used to rebuild the airport, shipyard and other facilities after the Falkland Islands war (1987); almost 9,800 items and pieces of equipment used in the US$1 billion cleanup operation following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska (1990) and the equipment used to build the Confederation Bridge that links the province of Prince Edward Island with the Canadian mainland (1997).
Ritchie Bros. also conducted the world’s largest industrial equipment auction in Orlando, FL in February 2012. The company sold more than US$203 million worth of equipment and trucks over six days (February 13 – 18, 2012). The auction featured more than 10,000 heavy equipment items and trucks and attracted more than 8,600 bidders from 88 countries.[30]
50th Anniversary[edit]
Ritchie Bros. celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. As a gift to the heavy equipment industries it launched RitchieWiki in September 2008 at MINExpo International in Las Vegas, Nevada.
In 2008 Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. conducted 340 unreserved industrial and agricultural auctions generating gross auction proceeds of US$3.58 billion.[31] The company sold more than 253,000 lots from 37,000 consignments and processed 277,000 bidder registrations. Of those, 84,000 were successful buyers with a total of 16,000 buyers purchasing their equipment online.[32]

History[edit]
The Ritchie Brothers[edit]
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers was established in Kelowna, B.C., Canada. The three Ritchie brothers – Ken, John and Dave Ritchie – took over the OK Used Furniture Store from their father in 1955. They entered the auction business in 1958 when they needed CA$2,000 to pay a bank debt on short notice. A friend suggested they conduct an auction to get rid of some surplus inventory from the furniture store. They conducted their first auction at the Scout Hall in Kelowna in 1958 and discovered a new way of doing business.[2]
Starting with that first auction at the Scout Hall, Ritchie Bros. maintained a strict policy of conducting unreserved auctions – meaning there were no minimum bids and no reserve prices. The brothers also established a policy of not allowing bid-ins or buybacks by the sellers.[3]
The brothers began conducting auctions more regularly and in 1958 incorporated Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to formalize their new business.[4] Ritchie Bros. began selling used equipment in the 1960s. In 1963 Dave Ritchie moved to Vancouver, B.C. and rented an auction site on S.E. Marine Drive. He set up the company's first equipment auction in Vancouver shortly after.[5]
The Ritchie brothers conducted their first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia on June 7, 1963. They sold CA$663,000 of equipment in one day – by far the largest auction in the company's history.[6]
The success of the Radium Hot Springs auction convinced the brothers that they could make more money auctioning used equipment than selling furniture, so they sold their furniture store in Kelowna and went into the auction business full-time.[7]
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers established one of the trademarks of its auctions at the Radium Hot Springs auction. It was raining on the day of the auction. Instead of making the bidders walk around in the rain during the auction, they set up the auction under the eaves of a nearby shop and drove the equipment in to be sold piece by piece. The crowd stayed dry and the ramp-and-stage method became a fixture at Ritchie Bros. auctions thereafter.[8]
50 years of unreserved industrial auctions[edit]
On June 7, 2013, Ritchie Bros. celebrated 50 years since the company’s first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia. It was at this Radium Hot Springs auction that Ritchie Bros. adopted the ramp-and-stage approach for selling all mobile equipment. This approach involves a staging area —designed as a ramp— located in front of a viewing theater, where bidders sit waiting for mobile equipment to come to “center stage.” Each piece of equipment is numbered and, once it comes to rest at the center of the ramp, the auctioneer begins asking for bids. The crowd of bidders signals their bid increments to roving “bid catchers,” who in turn signal the auctioneer when a bid is made. The auctioneer increases the call price until there are no more bids being placed. At a Ritchie Bros. auction, bids are called until no more are forthcoming in approximately one minute, when the auctioneer calls that the item has been “sold!” to the highest bidder.
The Company has pioneered the ramp-and-stage method and unreserved industrial auctions around the world ever since the auction at Radium Hot Springs on June 7, 1963.
The early auction years[edit]
Most of the company's earliest auctions were held in British Columbia. Ritchie Bros. began expanding into other parts of Canada in the mid-1960s, conducting its first auctions in Alberta (in 1964), the Yukon (1964), Saskatchewan (1965), Manitoba (1968), and other parts of Eastern Canada shortly thereafter.[9]
In 1965, Ken Ritchie left the company to spend more time with his family and the company’s name was changed from Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Ltd.[10] Ken established his own auction company, but returned to work with his brothers in 1968. He stayed with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers until 1980.[11]
In 1968, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers held its first auction with gross proceeds in excess of CA$1 million, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.[12] Edmonton was also the site of the company’s first permanent auction site (on company-owned land), which was established in 1976. Until then, Ritchie Bros. had been conducting its auctions on leased land.[13]
Expansion in the U.S.[edit]
Ritchie Bros. established its first presence outside Canada in 1969 when it became incorporated in Washington, USA.[14] The company held its first auction outside Canada in 1970, in Beaverton, Oregon, and gradually began expanding throughout the United States.[13]
In 1974, John Ritchie left the company, selling his share of the business to his brother Dave. In 1975, Dave Ritchie – the sole company shareholder – decided to sell partnerships in Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers to some of his key employees: Dick Bartel, C. Russell (“Russ”) Cmolik, Ken Ritchie, and Bill Gronberg.[15] Over the coming years, the partnership expanded to include Bob Carswell, Marvin Chantler, Ed Banser, Roger Rummel, Bob Brawley, Ken Asbury, John Wild, Marty Pope, Mark Clarke, Don Chalmers, Sylvain Touchette, Frank McFadden, and Mike Ritchie.[16] When Ritchie Bros. went public in 1998, Ken Ritchie and Bill Gronberg no longer owned shares in the company.
By 1985, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers had sold more than US$1 billion of equipment through unreserved auctions. It took only three more years for the company to gross another US$1 billion in sales.[13]
International expansion[edit]
In the late 1980s Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers began to look overseas for further growth opportunities. The company conducted its first auctions outside North America in 1987, in Liverpool, the U.K., and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The equipment sold at the Liverpool auction had been used to rebuild the Falkland Islands following the war there.[17] Further international expansion followed with the company's first auctions in Australia (1990), Mexico (1995), the Middle East (1997), Africa (2003), China (2013), and Finland (2013).[13]
In 1991, the company achieved another milestone when it conducted its 1,000th unreserved auction. It conducted its 2,000th auction in the year 2000.[13]
The role of technology[edit]
In 1989, Ritchie Bros. became the first industrial auction company to enable remote bidding via video when it broadcast its Edmonton auction live at the Agricom trade show in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Video simulcasts were held at trade shows in 1993 and 1995, followed in 1997 by a three-way videoconferenced auction that linked separate auction sites in St. Paul, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; and Clinton, Wisconsin. Equipment was located at all three sites, and interested buyers could bid at any of the sites, which were linked via video.[18]
The company launched its website, rbauction.com, at the ConExpo trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in 1996. The site featured a searchable database that enabled customers to see all of the equipment being sold in upcoming Ritchie Bros. auctions.[19]
In March 1999, Ritchie Bros. broadcast an auction over the Internet for the first time.[20] In March 2002, Ritchie Bros. introduced its real-time Internet bidding service, rbauctionBid-Live.[21]
 On September 22, 2008, Ritchie Bros. launched a comprehensive online resource tool for the construction, mining, transportation, agricultural and forestry industries at MINExpo International in Las Vegas. The tool is called RitchieWiki and is associated with an equipment specification engine called RitchieSpecs.
Going public[edit]
In 1998, the year that Ritchie Bros. went public, the company’s annual gross auction proceeds exceeded US$1 billion for the first time ever.[22] Its common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBA in March 1998, followed by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April 2004.[23]
Network of auction sites[edit]
Investing in permanent auction sites has been a company priority since the 1970s. Ritchie Bros. opened its first permanent auction site in Nisku (Edmonton), Alberta, Canada in 1976. Before going public in 1998, the company opened additional permanent auction sites in Vancouver, B.C. (in 1979); Prince George, B.C. (1980); Denver, Colorado (1985) – the first site in the U.S.; Phoenix, Arizona (1987); Toronto, Ontario (1988); Tampa, Florida (1995); Atlanta, Georgia (1996); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1991); Houston, Texas (1993); Fort Worth, Texas (1994); Olympia, Washington (1994); and Halifax, Nova Scotia (1997).[24]

Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Ritchie Bros. acquired Forke Brothers, an equipment auction company based in Nebraska, USA and one of its major competitors. The company moved its U.S. headquarters to Lincoln, Nebraska following the acquisition.[26] Ritchie Bros. made its foray into the agricultural equipment auction business with the acquisitions of All Peace Auctions of Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada in 2002; LeBlanc Auction Service of Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2004;[27] Dennis Biliske Auctioneers of Buxton, North Dakota, USA in 2006; Clarke Auctioneers of Rouleau, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2007;[28] and Martella Auction Company of Tipton, CA in 2009.[29]
Notable auctions[edit]
Among the notable auctions conducted by Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers: construction and other equipment used to rebuild the airport, shipyard and other facilities after the Falkland Islands war (1987); almost 9,800 items and pieces of equipment used in the US$1 billion cleanup operation following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska (1990) and the equipment used to build the Confederation Bridge that links the province of Prince Edward Island with the Canadian mainland (1997).
Ritchie Bros. also conducted the world’s largest industrial equipment auction in Orlando, FL in February 2012. The company sold more than US$203 million worth of equipment and trucks over six days (February 13 – 18, 2012). The auction featured more than 10,000 heavy equipment items and trucks and attracted more than 8,600 bidders from 88 countries.[30]

Ritchie Bros. celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. As a gift to the heavy equipment industries it launched RitchieWiki in September 2008 at MINExpo International in Las Vegas, Nevada.
In 2008 Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. conducted 340 unreserved industrial and agricultural auctions generating gross auction proceeds of US$3.58 billion.[31] The company sold more than 253,000 lots from 37,000 consignments and processed 277,000 bidder registrations.

History[edit]
The Ritchie Brothers[edit]
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers was established in Kelowna, B.C., Canada. The three Ritchie brothers – Ken, John and Dave Ritchie – took over the OK Used Furniture Store from their father in 1955. They entered the auction business in 1958 when they needed CA$2,000 to pay a bank debt on short notice. A friend suggested they conduct an auction to get rid of some surplus inventory from the furniture store. They conducted their first auction at the Scout Hall in Kelowna in 1958 and discovered a new way of doing business.[2]
Starting with that first auction at the Scout Hall, Ritchie Bros. maintained a strict policy of conducting unreserved auctions – meaning there were no minimum bids and no reserve prices. The brothers also established a policy of not allowing bid-ins or buybacks by the sellers.[3]
The brothers began conducting auctions more regularly and in 1958 incorporated Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to formalize their new business.[4] Ritchie Bros. began selling used equipment in the 1960s. In 1963 Dave Ritchie moved to Vancouver, B.C. and rented an auction site on S.E. Marine Drive. He set up the company's first equipment auction in Vancouver shortly after.[5]
The Ritchie brothers conducted their first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia on June 7, 1963. They sold CA$663,000 of equipment in one day – by far the largest auction in the company's history.[6]
The success of the Radium Hot Springs auction convinced the brothers that they could make more money auctioning used equipment than selling furniture, so they sold their furniture store in Kelowna and went into the auction business full-time.[7]
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers established one of the trademarks of its auctions at the Radium Hot Springs auction. It was raining on the day of the auction. Instead of making the bidders walk around in the rain during the auction, they set up the auction under the eaves of a nearby shop and drove the equipment in to be sold piece by piece. The crowd stayed dry and the ramp-and-stage method became a fixture at Ritchie Bros. auctions thereafter.[8]
50 years of unreserved industrial auctions[edit]
On June 7, 2013, Ritchie Bros. celebrated 50 years since the company’s first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia. It was at this Radium Hot Springs auction that Ritchie Bros. adopted the ramp-and-stage approach for selling all mobile equipment. This approach involves a staging area —designed as a ramp— located in front of a viewing theater, where bidders sit waiting for mobile equipment to come to “center stage.” Each piece of equipment is numbered and, once it comes to rest at the center of the ramp, the auctioneer begins asking for bids. The crowd of bidders signals their bid increments to roving “bid catchers,” who in turn signal the auctioneer when a bid is made. The auctioneer increases the call price until there are no more bids being placed. At a Ritchie Bros. auction, bids are called until no more are forthcoming in approximately one minute, when the auctioneer calls that the item has been “sold!” to the highest bidder.
The Company has pioneered the ramp-and-stage method and unreserved industrial auctions around the world ever since the auction at Radium Hot Springs on June 7, 1963.
The early auction years[edit]
Most of the company's earliest auctions were held in British Columbia. Ritchie Bros. began expanding into other parts of Canada in the mid-1960s, conducting its first auctions in Alberta (in 1964), the Yukon (1964), Saskatchewan (1965), Manitoba (1968), and other parts of Eastern Canada shortly thereafter.[9]
In 1965, Ken Ritchie left the company to spend more time with his family and the company’s name was changed from Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Ltd.[10] Ken established his own auction company, but returned to work with his brothers in 1968. He stayed with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers until 1980.[11]
In 1968, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers held its first auction with gross proceeds in excess of CA$1 million, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.[12] Edmonton was also the site of the company’s first permanent auction site (on company-owned land), which was established in 1976. Until then, Ritchie Bros. had been conducting its auctions on leased land.[13]
Expansion in the U.S.[edit]
Ritchie Bros. established its first presence outside Canada in 1969 when it became incorporated in Washington, USA.[14] The company held its first auction outside Canada in 1970, in Beaverton, Oregon, and gradually began expanding throughout the United States.[13]
In 1974, John Ritchie left the company, selling his share of the business to his brother Dave. In 1975, Dave Ritchie – the sole company shareholder – decided to sell partnerships in Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers to some of his key employees: Dick Bartel, C. Russell (“Russ”) Cmolik, Ken Ritchie, and Bill Gronberg.[15] Over the coming years, the partnership expanded to include Bob Carswell, Marvin Chantler, Ed Banser, Roger Rummel, Bob Brawley, Ken Asbury, John Wild, Marty Pope, Mark Clarke, Don Chalmers, Sylvain Touchette, Frank McFadden, and Mike Ritchie.[16] When Ritchie Bros. went public in 1998, Ken Ritchie and Bill Gronberg no longer owned shares in the company.
By 1985, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers had sold more than US$1 billion of equipment through unreserved auctions. It took only three more years for the company to gross another US$1 billion in sales.[13]
International expansion[edit]
In the late 1980s Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers began to look overseas for further growth opportunities. The company conducted its first auctions outside North America in 1987, in Liverpool, the U.K., and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The equipment sold at the Liverpool auction had been used to rebuild the Falkland Islands following the war there.[17] Further international expansion followed with the company's first auctions in Australia (1990), Mexico (1995), the Middle East (1997), Africa (2003), China (2013), and Finland (2013).[13]
In 1991, the company achieved another milestone when it conducted its 1,000th unreserved auction. It conducted its 2,000th auction in the year 2000.[13]
The role of technology[edit]
In 1989, Ritchie Bros. became the first industrial auction company to enable remote bidding via video when it broadcast its Edmonton auction live at the Agricom trade show in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Video simulcasts were held at trade shows in 1993 and 1995, followed in 1997 by a three-way videoconferenced auction that linked separate auction sites in St. Paul, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; and Clinton, Wisconsin. Equipment was located at all three sites, and interested buyers could bid at any of the sites, which were linked via video.[18]
The company launched its website, rbauction.com, at the ConExpo trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in 1996. The site featured a searchable database that enabled customers to see all of the equipment being sold in upcoming Ritchie Bros. auctions.[19]
In March 1999, Ritchie Bros. broadcast an auction over the Internet for the first time.[20] In March 2002, Ritchie Bros. introduced its real-time Internet bidding service, rbauctionBid-Live.[21]
 On September 22, 2008, Ritchie Bros. launched a comprehensive online resource tool for the construction, mining, transportation, agricultural and forestry industries at MINExpo International in Las Vegas. The tool is called RitchieWiki and is associated with an equipment specification engine called RitchieSpecs.
Going public[edit]
In 1998, the year that Ritchie Bros. went public, the company’s annual gross auction proceeds exceeded US$1 billion for the first time ever.[22] Its common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBA in March 1998, followed by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April 2004.[23]
Network of auction sites[edit]
Investing in permanent auction sites has been a company priority since the 1970s. Ritchie Bros. opened its first permanent auction site in Nisku (Edmonton), Alberta, Canada in 1976. Before going public in 1998, the company opened additional permanent auction sites in Vancouver, B.C. (in 1979); Prince George, B.C. (1980); Denver, Colorado (1985) – the first site in the U.S.; Phoenix, Arizona (1987); Toronto, Ontario (1988); Tampa, Florida (1995); Atlanta, Georgia (1996); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1991); Houston, Texas (1993); Fort Worth, Texas (1994); Olympia, Washington (1994); and Halifax, Nova Scotia (1997).[24]

Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Ritchie Bros. acquired Forke Brothers, an equipment auction company based in Nebraska, USA and one of its major competitors. The company moved its U.S. headquarters to Lincoln, Nebraska following the acquisition.[26] Ritchie Bros. made its foray into the agricultural equipment auction business with the acquisitions of All Peace Auctions of Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada in 2002; LeBlanc Auction Service of Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2004;[27] Dennis Biliske Auctioneers of Buxton, North Dakota, USA in 2006; Clarke Auctioneers of Rouleau, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2007;[28] and Martella Auction Company of Tipton, CA in 2009.[29]

Ritchie Bros. also conducted the world’s largest industrial equipment auction in Orlando, FL in February 2012. The company sold more than US$203 million worth of equipment and trucks over six days (February 13 – 18, 2012).

	Item 2.01     Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.



	 


	On May 31, 2017, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers
	Incorporated (the “Company”) completed its previously announced acquisition of IronPlanet Holdings, Inc. (“IronPlanet”)
	pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Topaz
	Mergersub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), IronPlanet and Fortis Advisors LLC (as representative of the indemnifying securityholders
	thereunder). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into IronPlanet, with IronPlanet continuing
	as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, IronPlanet became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	Under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
	each share of IronPlanet capital stock outstanding at the completion of the Merger was converted into a right to receive a cash
	payment. Vested options were converted into a right to receive a cash payment net of the applicable option exercise price, and
	unvested equity interests in IronPlanet were assumed by the Company and converted into a right to receive Company equity, subject
	to the same vesting schedule and restrictions as applied prior to the Merger.


	 


	The total merger consideration was approximately
	$758.5 million, of which a portion in cash was deposited in escrow to cover certain indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement
	for a period of nine months following the completion of the merger, subject to extension for any unresolved indemnification claims.


	 


	The foregoing description of the merger
	is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed
	as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 31, 2016.



	 





	Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an
	Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.




	 



	In connection with the acquisition of IronPlanet,
	on May 31, 2017, the Company borrowed $325 million using the delayed draw term loan facility (the “Delayed Draw Facility”)
	under the syndicated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) between the Company and certain of its subsidiaries,
	each as a borrower or guarantor, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, U.S. swing line lender and letter of credit issuer,
	Royal Bank of Canada, as Canadian swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. The Company
	previously disclosed the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November
	2, 2016. The commitment to provide the  Delayed Draw Facility terminated with its funding. The Credit Agreement was unsecured
	until the closing of the acquisition of IronPlanet, after which the facilities thereunder (including the Delayed Draw Facility)
	became secured by substantially all assets, subject to certain exceptions, of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the
	United States and Canada, and IronPlanet and certain of its subsidiaries were joined as guarantors under the Credit Agreement.
	The facilities under the Credit Agreement may become unsecured in the future, subject to the Company meeting credit ratings or
	leverage ratio conditions.




	 







	Item 7.01     Regulation FD Disclosure.



	 


	On May 31, 2017, the Company issued a press
	release announcing the completion of the acquisition of IronPlanet. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto
	and is incorporated into this Item 7.01 by reference.

	VANCOUVER,
	B.C., May 31, 2017 –

	Ritchie Bros., the world’s largest heavy equipment auctioneer and provider of end-to-end
	services (NYSE & TSX: RBA), today announced that it completed its acquisition of IronPlanet

	®

	,
	a leading online marketplace for heavy equipment and other durable assets. Ritchie Bros. acquired IronPlanet for approximately
	$758.5 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The acquisition was financed through a combination of Ritchie Bros.’
	previously announced senior note offering and secured term loan facility. The transaction is expected to be earnings accretive
	within the first year, excluding acquisition related costs.


	 


	The acquisition of IronPlanet accelerates Ritchie
	Bros.’ strategy of becoming a one-stop, multichannel company where customers can buy, sell or list equipment, when, how and
	where they choose – both onsite and online. Later this year, Ritchie Bros. will combine its online EquipmentOne brand with
	the IronPlanet DailyMarketplace, creating a harmonized brand offering called Marketplace E that gives customers more ways to set
	reserve pricing. Ritchie Bros. also gains expanded growth capabilities in the oil and gas and government sectors.


	 


	The company will be combining the Ritchie Bros.
	and IronPlanet sales forces in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in line with its strategy to provide customers a one-stop, multichannel
	experience. Territory and Strategic Account Managers will be positioned as solution sellers and offer customers three main product
	offerings: RBA integrated unreserved onsite auctions; IronPlanet weekly featured auctions and Marketplace E, an IronPlanet solution.
	Mascus, Kruse Energy and GovPlanet will continue to remain as stand-alone businesses with stand-alone sales teams, given that they
	serve specialized customer segments.


	 


	As a part of this acquisition, Ritchie Bros. also
	enters into an initial five-year strategic alliance with Caterpillar which is expected to strengthen its relationship with Caterpillar's
	independent dealers around the world by providing them enhanced and continued access to a global auction marketplace to sell their
	used equipment. The company also will continue to coordinate and manage Cat

	®

	auctions in respective Cat dealer geographies.


	 


	“We are pleased that the acquisition of
	IronPlanet has been completed and I am delighted to welcome IronPlanet employees to the Ritchie Bros. family. Our shared passion
	for serving customers is loud and clear and it will continue to be our guiding light in the unified company,” said Ravi Saligram,
	Ritchie Bros. CEO. “Our integration plans have been meticulously worked on during the last nine months: our combined senior
	management team will be in place Day 1 and our sales forces will be integrated within the first 30 days. In the second half of
	2017, we will focus on aligning and unifying the company, optimizing the integration, starting to achieve synergies and getting
	the organization ready for a fast start in 2018 to deliver growth and add shareholder value.”

Retailing Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Retailing is defined as any company involved in the sale of product or services. There are many ways to sell products. One can sell products online, in a storefront or by mail/catalog. Most brick and mortar stores have become chain stores that undercut mom and pop shops by purchasing large quantities in bulk and spread across multiple stores or in regions. 
	 Similarly, companies involved in selling products online or via mail/catalog are able to store product off premise and utilize replenishment systems or logistic companies to ship from off site locations.
Proper research can allow small businesses to expand their reach by creating an ecommerce store front or selling online. Retail outlets can be any product or service being sold. Convenience Stores, gas stations, home stores, technology stores, warehouse clubs, department stores, discount stores and chain stores are most well known. Having a strong base of suppliers is pivotal for the success of any retailer. Retailers can be affected by consumer confidence, personal income and interest rates on either credit cards or loans. Developing an in depth understanding of the parameters of retailing will aid in ensuring any company the success in a marketplace.

2012:
• Re-platformed its Oracle E-Business Suite from an NFS-based technology stack to an Intel/Linux and SAN-based environment. As a part of this, they upgraded the ERP system from 11i to R12.1.3 for all Financials, CRM, and HR modules.
• Restructured data management delivery practices. The project impacted the company's business intelligence (BI) and data warehousing (DW) processes as well as its master data management, data security, document and content management, and data quality management processes.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
