KILMARNOCK, Va., Jan. 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc. (OTCQB: BAYK), holding company for Bank of Lancaster and Bay Trust Company, reported earnings of $571,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to a loss of $(590,000) for the same quarter in 2015.  Earnings for the year 2016 were $2.5 million compared to $366,000 for the year 2015.  








"It's been more than 10 years since earnings have been this high and that was before the great recession started.  We also announced our merger with Virginia Commonwealth Bank in the fourth quarter, which, once consummated, will make us the fifth largest community bank headquartered in Richmond," said Randal R. Greene, President and Chief Executive Officer.  He continued, "We are extremely proud of our team of professionals.  To pull off a record year and prepare for a merger at the same time is incredible.  The merger is moving forward as planned, with regulatory approvals in process and expected completion at the beginning of the second quarter of 2017."
HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE QUARTER

Earnings were $0.12 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.18 per share for the prior quarter and a loss of $(0.12) per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Annualized return on average assets was 0.48% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 0.72% for the prior quarter and (0.54)% for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Merger-related costs were $575,000 during the fourth quarter, which is equivalent to $0.10 per share after tax, including consideration of $257,000 of non-deductible expenses. 
Total loans grew by $16.8 million, or 4.6%, during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Total deposits grew by $3.7 million, or 1.0%, during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Total assets increased $18.4 million, or 3.9%, during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
The fourth quarter's net interest margin was 3.45% compared to 3.40% for the prior quarter and 3.44% for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE YEAR

Earnings were $0.53 per share for 2016 compared to $0.08 per share for 2015. 
Annualized return on average assets was 0.55% for 2016 compared to 0.09% for 2015. 
Merger-related costs were $575,000, which is equivalent to $0.10 per share after tax for 2016, including consideration of $257,000 of non-deductible expenses.

Total deposits grew by $21.9 million, or 6.1%, during 2016. 
Total assets increased $30.4 million, or 6.7%, to $486.7 million, during 2016. 
The net interest margin for 2016 was 3.40% compared to 3.48% for 2015. 

FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME

Net interest income increased by 2.8%, or $104,000, on a linked-quarter basis and increased by 9.7%, or $334,000, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Provision for loan losses decreased by $379,000 on a linked-quarter basis, and by $1.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Noninterest income decreased by 0.6%, or $8,000 on a linked-quarter basis, and increased 69.6%, or $546,000, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Noninterest expense increased by 22.0%, or $786,000, on a linked-quarter basis, and increased by 10.0%, or $395,000, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

The increase in net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by an increase in interest income of $322,000 while interest expense decreased by $12,000.  The improved interest income was driven by growth in loan balances and improved yields on investment securities, which offset reductions in loan yields.  
The increase in non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily the result of increased secondary market lending fees of $158,000, decreased losses on OREO of $115,000 and increased gains on the sale of securities of $107,000.
Non-interest expense totaled $4.4 million and $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Merger related expenses during the fourth quarter totaled approximately $575,000.  The merger expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $106,000 in salaries and benefits expense, which was mainly driven by $132,000 of severance expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015.
YEAR-TO-DATE NET INCOME

Net interest income increased by 9.0%, or $1.2 million, to $14.4 million, for 2016 compared to 2015. 
Provision for loan losses decreased by 82.0%, or $1.3 million, to $287,000, for 2016 compared to 2015. 
Noninterest income increased by 37.2%, or $1.3 million, to $4.6 million, for 2016 compared to 2015. 
Noninterest expense increased 2.9%, or $431,000, to $15.2 million, for 2016 compared to 2015.

The increase in net interest income for 2016 compared 2015 was driven by an increase in interest income of $1.7 million while interest expense increased by $491,000.  The improvement in interest income was driven primarily by growth in loan balances and yields on investment securities, which partially offset the reduced yields on loans.  The increase in interest expense was due primarily to growth of money market deposit accounts and the subordinated debt issued in May 2015.
The increase in non-interest income for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a $393,000 increase in gains on the sale of investments, a $150,000 gain from the sale of the VISA loan portfolio to a third party, a $169,000 increase in fiduciary fees, decreased losses on foreclosed real estate of $268,000, and a $214,000 increase in secondary market lending fees.
The increase in non-interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 was driven mainly by merger related expenses of approximately $588,000, which was partially offset by a $202,000 decrease in salaries and benefits expense, which in turn was mainly a result of severance expense of $143,000 recognized in 2015.
NET INTEREST MARGIN

Net interest margin increased to 3.45% this quarter compared to 3.40% on a linked-quarter basis and 3.44% for the fourth quarter of 2015, as low market rates continue to affect loan yields. 
Yield on earning assets increased to 4.23% this quarter compared to 4.22% on a linked-quarter basis and decreased from 4.29% for the fourth quarter of 2015, as increases in investment yields sometimes mitigated reductions in loan yields. 
Cost of funds declined to 0.80% this quarter compared to 0.83% on a linked-quarter basis and 0.88% for the fourth quarter of 2015, due to reductions in money market and time deposit rates.  

ASSET QUALITY

As a percentage of tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses, total classified assets decreased to 26.0% as of December 31, 2016, compared to 27.3% for the prior quarter-end and increased from 25.8% as of December 31, 2015. 
Total classified assets decreased to $11.7 million, a reduction of $407,000 on a linked-quarter basis and an increase of $642,000 compared to December 31, 2015. 
Nonperforming assets decreased to $7.8 million, a reduction of $6,000 during the fourth quarter and a reduction of $520,000 since December 31, 2015. 
Nonperforming assets represented 1.60% of total assets as of December 31, 2016, compared to 1.67% on a linked-quarter basis and to 1.82% as of December 31, 2015. 
Annualized net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percent of average loans were (0.26)% during the fourth quarter, compared to 0.03% during the prior quarter and 0.46% during the fourth quarter of 2015.  On a full-year basis, net charge-offs were 0.17% of average loans. 
Allowance for loan losses decreased to 1.00% of total loans, from 1.02% in the prior quarter and 1.22% at December 31, 2015.  
Coverage of loan loss reserves to non-performing loans was 72.9% as of December 31, 2016, compared to 74.3% at the prior quarter end and 65.5% at December 31, 2015.  

Non-performing asset levels remain comparable to our peer banks.  During 2016, non-performing assets, excluding troubled debt restructures (TDRs), decreased by $520,000 to $7.8 million, or 1.60% of total assets.  Classified assets increased by $642,000 during the same period to $11.7 million, or 26.0% of tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses.  Net loan charge-offs totaled $620,000 during 2016, or 0.17% of average total loans, compared to 0.18% during 2015.  Favorably impacting net charge-offs was approximately $280,000 of recoveries related to the previously disclosed loan fraud perpetrated against the Bank.
BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL

Total assets grew 6.7% to $486.7 million during 2016. 
Tangible common equity as a percent of tangible assets decreased to 8.24% from 8.61% on a linked-quarter basis, and from 8.32% at December 31, 2015. 
Tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 8.67% this quarter compared to 8.60% last quarter and 8.84% at December 31, 2015.

During 2016, total assets increased by $30.4 million, or 6.7%, to $486.7 million.  This was due to an increase of $37.9 million in the loan portfolio which was funded mainly by an increase of $21.9 million in deposits and a reduction of $7.8 million in interest-bearing deposits at other banks.  The increase in deposits, plus an increase of $11.1 million in securities sold under repurchase agreements, allowed for a $5.0 million reduction in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta.  Of the growth in total deposits, non-interest bearing deposits grew by $9.0 million and savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increased $12.2 million.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

"The shareholders of Bay Banks overwhelmingly agreed with those of Virginia BanCorp in the vision of a merger of equals," explains Randal R. Greene, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bay Banks of Virginia. "We will witness two locally owned community banks, each with more than 80 years of service to their communities, unite to serve our customers with new services and even greater financial strength."
"Our shareholders are enthusiastic about adding new capabilities and services to current and new Central Virginia customers," says C. Frank Scott, III, President and Chief Executive Officer of Virginia BanCorp. "It is important to note that we will continue to be locally owned and focused on Richmond and our Central Virginia customers. We will build on each bank's reputation and provide new services within business banking, residential and commercial mortgages, and wealth management." The combined bank will locate its new corporate office to Richmond.
Virginia BanCorp shareholders will receive 4,586,397 shares of Bay Banks' stock, which is approximately 49% of the total shares outstanding, for a total deal value of $40.1 million, based on the price of Bay Banks' stock on March 16, 2017.  Current Bay Banks shareholders will maintain approximately 51% interest in the newly merged entity.
Regulatory approvals for the merger have been received from the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the Federal Reserve. 
Bank of Lancaster, based in Kilmarnock, operates 11 branches in the Northern Neck and in Richmond. Virginia Commonwealth Bank operates eight branches from Petersburg to Suffolk, including Richmond. Bank of Lancaster branches will maintain their identity until banking systems are consolidated in the fourth quarter of this year. "We are committed to making the transition as seamless as possible for our customers and employees," Greene concludes.
