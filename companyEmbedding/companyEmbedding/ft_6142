LED Mini Lights
LED Christmas lights are the top choice for decorating indoor and outdoor spaces this holiday season. With colors ranging from warm white, orange, green, and many more, you can choose string lights in your favorite color or to match your holiday theme. Our deluxe warm white light strings are a very warm, almost champagne, color. Please note that our purple lights tend to appear closer to red than blue on the purple scale. Multi-colored lights are also available if you can't decide which color you'd prefer. Most string lights are available in three different wire colors: green, white, and brown.


Brighter than traditional incandescent stringers, LEDs come in several shapes to match your style or replicate tradition stringers.

Wide Angle – These lights are 5 millimeters wide and are often called "wide angle” mini lights. The normal rounded tip has been drilled in to create a concave shape which allows the light to be dispersed in a 180-degree beam angle.

Shimmering Spot – As the original LED mini light design, this shape focuses the light straight out of the rounded tip while also releasing some light in a 180-degree angle. This shape and its concentrated light also helps create a unique "twinkling” effect when the lights sway gently and are viewed from afar. The effect is compared to dozens of tiny flashlights, blinking on and off.

Traditional Shape – Traditional shaped LEDs bring you the energy savings of LED while maintain the classic look of incandescent mini lights.

Faceted Traditional – Faceted means the colored cap is cut in a prismatic or crystal-like pattern. The faceted cap simply softens the light. You get less sharpness but maintain the rich color which LEDs provide.


All of our LED string light are single piece molded construction, meaning the bulbs cannot be replaced. This protects from water invading the sockets, making them safe for outdoor use.


From 17 to 25.5 feet in length, these LED string lights have either 50 or 70 bulbs per string. Using 3.5 to 4.8 watts, Christmas string lights are an easy way to add color and shine to the interior or exterior of your residential or commercial space. Decorate your tree with LED Christmas light strings from 1000Bulbs.com to make your holiday season sparkle.

Description
Bring a traditional look to your holiday lighting with yellow wide angle LED mini Christmas lights. The 50 bulbs are spaced 6 inches apart on 25 feet of green wire, making the string ideal to wrap wreaths, topiaries, and tree trunks. UL listed for indoor and outdoor use, 87 sets can safely be combined end-to-end. Cool to the touch and ten times more energy efficient than incandescent, these patented wide angle LEDs are equally brilliant no matter where they point.

        Great with green and purple for spring and Easter
I strung the green around the sun porch windows for St Patricks Day and neighbors loved them. And then, adding the purple and yellow, I had a perfect Spring and Easter light decoration. Neighbors raved about how good the colors looked and expressed the holiday so well.

        The color is bright. The lights are durable and long lasting.
I am using these year round in my backyard and I enjoy the lights every night!

        Quality LED product
We are a botanical gardens that hosts a 'Garden of Lights' display every December. It is a huge undertaking to string lights on trees, shrubs, and architectural features as well as 'flowers' we create out of these LED lights. What we order, we want to last from year to year. We have not had a string of lights fail from one season to the next. The product is also well built. We have not experienced any snow/moisture seeping in between the bulb and lamp base.

I would and will be purchasing this product again.

        The yellow looks more orange when lit than yellow.
The lights are bright and the cord is very durable and great for outdoors. I wanted a brighter yellow color. The color looked more orange when lit than yellow.

        Does the job
Bought these to wrap around the railings on the back deck. Looks great, very pleased with the effect, soft white, slightly yellow, not the white white of LEDs which can look a bit cold. Lights up the area and takes the dark look away from the patio kitchen doors leading to the deck. Looked great in the snowy wintery days and still look good now in the summer months. Wiring and LED bulbs have held up well after one winter, now outside for 6 months and counting.
