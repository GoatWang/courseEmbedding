During The Second Century Campaign, University officials traveled around the country and across the globe to share the Campaign's excitement with alumni, parents and friends.
"We are honored to have so many help us with this ambitious effort," said Brad E. Cheves, vice president for development and external affairs. "And, just as the results of this campaign will transcend our campus, we are moving beyond North Texas to share the excitement with alumni, parents and friends regionally, nationally and internationally."

Thanks to the inspiring generosity of farsighted donors, SMU Unbridled: The Second Century Campaign created a firm foundation for the University’s second century of achievement. Extraordinary support from alumni, friends, parents and students enabled the campaign to raise $1.15 billion.
Every major goal of the campaign was surpassed:

Over $1.15 billion in commitments were received, the largest campaign receipts in the history of Texas private colleges and universities.
689 endowed scholarships were created, smashing the goal of 500. 
54 new endowed faculty positions were added, pushing the University total to 116. 
24 major new facilities or major renovations were significantly funded, adding measurably to SMU’s academic, residential and campus space.
Nearly 60 percent of alumni made a gift during the campaign, far beyond the goal of 50 percent. 
In a single year, 26 percent of undergraduate alumni donated, exceeding the goal of 25 percent. 

The legacy of this investment will forever enhance the University’s ability to attract and shape the expert faculty and the future leaders who will change their world. 
We invite you to learn more about the accomplishments of the campaign, see the names of the more than 65,000 donors and more than 500 volunteers who made the campaign successful, and review the final campaign report.
