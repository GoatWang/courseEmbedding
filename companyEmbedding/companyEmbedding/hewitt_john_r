John Hewitt - CEO of Liberty Tax Service

Bio: After managing more than 2,000 preparers in 250 offices
  for H&R Block, John Hewitt identified that the future of tax
  preparation needed a technological innovation.  So in 1982,
  Hewitt founded Jackson Hewitt and, in 1986, started franchise
  operations. Hewitt's business plan was to utilize the
  revolutionary "Hewtax" computerized tax interview software that
  he and his father created, and also outperform the competition
  with superlative customer service. By 1996 Jackson Hewitt was the
  second largest tax preparation company and sold for $483
  million.
By then, Hewitt was ready for a new business venture. But
  after brainstorming with some of his trusted colleagues, they
  decided that they knew and loved one thing: taxes. And they knew
  they could do it better by starting over. So the same year
  Jackson Hewitt sold, John Hewitt purchased 126 U&R Tax
  offices in Canada. Just two years later, he had established
  thirty offices in seven markets in the U.S. (and nearly 250
  offices including Canada). Today, with more than 4,100 offices
  across the continent, Liberty Tax Service is the fastest growing
  tax preparation company EVER.
Hewitt has successfully navigated 43 career tax seasons,
  making him the most experienced CEO in the industry. He is a
  philanthropist, an avid chess and bridge player, further
  exemplifying his strategic impulses and need for competition. For
  twelve consecutive years, he has been named one of the "Top 100
  Most Influential People in the Tax Industry" by Accounting Today
  and was also named "Entrepreneur of the Year" by both the
  International Franchise Association and Ernst and Young.

Tell us about the Liberty Tax Service concept.
The concept of providing excellent customer service and
    keeping the customer happy so that they become a repeat
    customer isn't new, but so few companies act on it. They talk a
    good game but they don't do the research and the follow up. It
    requires changing the status quo. That's where Liberty Tax is
    different. We deliver. For example, if you come into our
    offices and have to wait more than 15 minutes, we pay you. We
    truly do put the customer first. Our dedication to unparalleled
    customer service and delivering the WOW factor is what we call
    the "Liberty Edge".  We deliver the little unexpected
    extras that make people take notice and feel appreciated.
How and when did you decide on Liberty Tax Service?
It really did start on a napkin. Some of my most trusted
    colleagues and I sat down and wrote on the back of a napkin, 13
    things we would do differently from what we had done in the
    past to create an environment of success. We wanted to take on
    the 800lb gorilla in H&R Block and the company that bore my
    name, Jackson Hewitt. People thought we were crazy - insane!
    But we vowed to implement some of those 13 ideas. We acted on
    what we knew was the right way to do business. And we
    succeeded.
What was your background prior to Liberty Tax Service?
When I was 19 years old, I started a job as a tax preparer
    and it was the most interesting job I had ever had. I enjoyed
    the work immensely and it showed. I quickly climbed the ranks,
    becoming a District Manager, and then the youngest Regional
    Director in H&R Block history at the time. Of course, I
    then went on to found Jackson Hewitt.
What are some of the advantages in being a Liberty Tax
    franchise?
We believe in creating happy, successful franchisees. They
    are at the core of developing our operating system. Our unique
    marketing approach helps each franchise get immediate
    recognition in communities everywhere. Whether it's with
    "Wavers" in the Statue of Liberty costumes or roadside parties
    serving hot dogs, we draw attention to our Liberty Tax
    locations.  We deeply believe in the grass roots of our
    communities.
Who is your ideal franchisee?
Liberty franchisees are all different. They're retirees,
    CPAs, full-time Moms, bankers and insurance pros. For all their
    differences, they do share a few common beliefs - they embrace
    the challenge of being self-employed and believe in following a
    proven system that will led them to succeed.
Tell us a little about the tax market?
Of the 132 million tax returns filed by Americans each year,
    62% of those pay someone to prepare and file their tax return
    for them. In this economy, some mom and pop tax service shops
    are closing their doors. So there is a lot of consolidation
    happening. For those not wanting a new boss, a Liberty Tax
    Franchise allows them to be their own boss; we just provide the
    experience and proven track record.
Remember the two certainties in life? Death and taxes. Well,
    we must also embrace the third certainty - change. While other
    companies flounder to understand market changes, at Liberty
    Tax, we respond and move forward.
What are some of the greatest lessons you've learned in
    growing this franchise?
That I'm still learning.
In starting a business, you need to really test your
    concepts and ideas. Test, test, and retest. Be willing to go
    back to the drawing board. Also treat your employees as if they
    are your best paying customer because in reality they are the
    day-to-day representatives of your company. And probably the
    most important lesson I learned, when you put your heart and
    soul into a company, always have a controlling interest.
Do you have a mentor and is there someone you use for
    inspiration?
My father was a great mentor, he advised me on when to get
    in and when to get out of a career situation. We were both
    visionaries. He showed me the vision of computerized tax
    preparation and when we couldn't convince H&R Block to buy
    our program, he convinced me to start my own retail tax
    company. He was a great supporter and motivator.
What advice do you have for someone looking to acquire a
    franchise?
The passion has to be there. You have to be committed to
    your success. Follow the system that the franchisor has put in
    place, and follow the advice they give. Be prepared to trust
    the experts. They want you to succeed as much as you do. It's
    like a marriage; both sides need to be happy.
In your opinion, why do you think that Liberty Tax would be
    a great opportunity for someone?
One great aspect about Liberty Tax is you work hard for
    three and a half months then can reward yourself with some
    personal enrichment time and valuable time with family.
It provides a great quality of life. A seasonal business
    also affords you the time to prepare and train for the next
    season. And speaking of training, we provide regular and
    ongoing webinars and programs. We have everything you need for
    startup - the proprietary software, support and insight 52
    weeks a year and a proven marketing plan that sets Liberty Tax
    apart from the crowd.
