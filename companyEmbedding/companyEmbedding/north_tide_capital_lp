Tide PODS® clean better by helping remove dirt left behind by the bargain laundry detergent*.
Tide PODS® are small but powerful. They pack 6X cleaning power** with an innovative, multi-chamber design separating key ingredients until they hit the wash for maximum cleaning power.
Each Tide PODS is a 3-in-1 breakthrough technology with detergent, stain remover and color protector, giving you more bang for your buck.
The special film that enables the 3-in-1 breakthrough technology dissolves in both hot & cold water.
Tide PODS® are formulated with quick collapsing Smart Suds™, targets tough stains and works in both HE and standard washing machines.
Its Original scent is infused with floral and fruity notes to help keep your family’s clothes smelling as great as they look.

Tide PODS® is formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power** in half the time. Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing Smart Suds™ and targets tough stains. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds.
Place Tide PODS® pac into the washing machine drum before you add clothes. Turn on any cycle, without worry as Tide PODS® dissolves in any temperature. For especially dirty loads, you can add more pacs.
*Based on 4 solid cycles with leading liquid bargain laundry detergent followed by 1 cycle with 1 dose of leading liquid bargain laundry detergent vs. 1 cycle with Tide PODS®.
**Based on stain removal performance of 1 pac of Tide PODS® vs 6 doses of the leading liquid bargain brand base variant in a standard top loading machine.

The Most Important Ingredient in Tide® is Safety


Ensuring the safety of Tide® products is a responsibility that P&G takes very seriously. Before any product can appear on store shelves, it must be demonstrated to be safe to use as intended.

Q: What is the difference between PODS® and other types of laundry detergent?
A: PODS® detergent pacs are a super concentrated liquid detergent that is specially designed in a small and compact unit dose form to give you a great clean. They are already pre-measured so no need to measure or pour, and the pac goes directly into the back of the drum of your washing machine before adding clothes, not in the dispenser.

Q: How do Tide PODS® work?
A: Tide PODS® clean, fight stains, and brighten all in one. The unique, multi-chamber design allows ingredients to remain separate, stable, and potent—mixing only when they hit the wash for outstanding cleaning and stain removal.

Q: How do I use Tide PODS®?
A: Place a pac in the washing machine drum before you add clothes (never add Tide PODS® to the dosing drawer). For especially dirty loads, you can add a second pac.

Q: Do Tide PODS® work in front- and top-loading machines?
A: Yes, Tide PODS® work well in standard and high efficiency machines. The formula is designed to prevent over-sudsing while also giving a great clean.

Q: Will Tide PODS® dissolve in cold water?
A: Yes, the film is designed to dissolve in all water temperatures, hot or cold.

Q: Do Tide PODS® work equally well on whites and colors?
A: Yes. Tide PODS® have been thoroughly tested on all sorts of laundry conditions, and are safe for both whites and colors.

Q: Should I worry about staining or residues?
A: No. Tide PODS® are designed to dissolve completely in all water temperatures, and will not stain your clothes when used as directed.

We're so sorry this was happening! The good news is this residue is not permanent and can be removed by soaking the garment in the hottest water safe for the fabrics for a least 1 hour and then rewashing according to care tag label.

Pods remain on clothes





I have used the Pods for several years now and it seems like in the last 6 months or so I wind up having to rewash clothes. I also ruined a sweater that stained bluish/purple.
I am going to use the pods I have left and move onto something else.

Every Tide detergent contains many ingredients with long, complicated names. So you have a better idea of what does what, here is a list of the most common ingredients in Tide detergents. 
Alcohol Ethoxylate (AE)
A non-ionic surfactant. Surfactants allow water and grease to mix, helping to remove greasy stains from your garments.
Alkyl Ethoxy Sulfate (AES) and Alkyl Sulfate (AS)
Two anionic surfactants that help liquid detergents bind to impurities in fabrics. They are two of the most widely used tools for removing stains.
Amine Oxide
An amphoteric surfactant, commonly used in detergents and shampoos. Used along with other surfactants to remove stains. Can be anionic, cationic or non-ionic.
Citric Acid
Found in lemons and citrus fruits, it’s mild and helps to remove bad smells from clothes. Known as a chelating agent, which is used to soften water.
Cyclodextrin
Another chelating agent that removes malodors from garments.
Enzymes
Naturally occurring proteins that break down stains into smaller pieces to make stains easier to remove.
Ethanol
A clear, colorless alcohol used as a solvent in detergents.
Hydrogen Peroxide
One of the simplest and most common bleaching agents.
Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS)
The most widely used anionic surfactant in the world. Removes stains from your garments.
Percarbonate
Sodium percabonate is a bleaching agent used in detergents.
Perfumes
Provide pleasant, calming, joyful scents released from product itself and from fabric.
Polyethylene Glycols (PEG), Polyethylene Oxide (PEO) or Polyoxyethylene (POE)
A polyether compound used for many things, including as a lubricant and surfactant.
Polymers
Penetrate soils and break them up making the soils easier to remove and help prevent stains from re-depositing on  fabrics.
Polyvinyl Alcohol
A water-soluble synthetic polymer used to make the casing for liquid tabs and Tide PODS®.

Q: What is new Tide purclean™?
A: Tide purclean™ is the first bio-based detergent with the trusted cleaning power of Tide. Tide purclean™ delivers superior stain removal and cleans well in energy-saving cold water.  In fact, Tide purclean™ cleans as well as Tide Original Laundry Detergent.   With 65% bio-based ingredients, as certified by the USDA BioPreferred program, Tide purclean™ aims to set the performance standard for natural detergents and in turn bring more consumers to the natural detergent category.
Q: Why is Tide choosing to launch a natural detergent?
A: We believe the best way to help create a more sustainable future is to make the products that people use and love every day better. Tide purclean™ is the next step in our journey to create detergents that help consumers make sustainable choices. We are exploring using more natural ingredients not only because of the positive impacts an increased use of renewable materials will have on the environment and the sustainability of our business, long-term, but also because more and more consumers are seeking out natural ingredients in their products. After all, a more sustainable detergent can only have impact if people use it!
Q: How is new Tide purclean™ different from Base Tide?  What changes did you make to the formula?
A: Tide purclean™ is the first bio-based detergent with the cleaning power of Tide, containing 65% bio-based ingredients.  The Tide purclean™ formulation includes plant-based surfactants and solvents. Both formulas are held to the highest standards of safety and efficacy, but Tide purclean™ offers an option for consumers seeking a simple step to integrate renewable biobased products into their daily routines that meet their cleaning expectations.
Q: Does this really clean as well as Tide? (vs. Tide Original)
A: Yes! When we set out to develop Tide purclean™, our goal was to create a detergent we’d be proud to have in the Tide family.
Q: Does Tide purclean™ clean in cold water?
A: Yes. Our formulators have designed Tide purclean™ to clean even in cold water, helping you to do your part in energy conservation via cold-water washing.  Heating wash water is the largest driver of energy consumption when running your washing machine.  All the steps your take toward preserving the planet for future generations add up to make a meaningful impact.
Q: Is Tide purclean™ designed for High Efficiency machines and traditional top loading machines?
A: Yes, it provides outstanding cleaning performance in all types of machines.
Q: What is required for a product to qualify for the USDA BioPreferred designation?
A: To achieve the USDA BioPreferred seal, the product must be at least 34% bio-based. Tide Purclean™ is 65% bio-based, certified by the USDA BioPreferred program, meaning the current formulation contains nearly twice the bio-based content required for certification.
Q: Should I use Tide purclean™ for all my loads?
A: Tide purclean™ is safe for all your loads.  It is packed with bio-based cleaning  ingredients that will keep your whites white, colors bright, and your clothes looking and smelling clean and fresh.

Not happy with this product!





Washed my clothes in this twice and my son's socks still were dirty & smelly. Had to use a different Tide to get the smell and dirt out of the clothes. Left with 2 useless bottles of this stuff!

Great for Large loads, bad for small loads





Overall, great product. However, be wary with SMALL loads! Use very little! I washed 2 small loads, and got LOTS of suds in my machine. I had to wash them a 2nd time to get rid of the suds/residue!

You can expect to see more suds with Tide purclean compared to our traditional formulas. To avoid this, we recommend paying close attention to the dosing guidelines listed on the back of the bottle and not exceeding the dose required for your load size. As long as you use only the recommend amount for your size of load, you should be able to wash all load sizes without any issues.

Love this Tide





I love this new Honey & Lavender Tide scent. I'm not sure about the issues with too many suds, I don't need that much to get my clothes clean. I wish there was a fabric softener that matches!

North Tide Captial





















































































































































North Tide Capital is a value-oriented investment management company focused on the healthcare industry. We founded our firm in 2005, and operated as a sub-adviser to a multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2005 until 2011. In September 2011, we launched our flagship fund to manage our own capital and that of a select group of like-minded limited partners.Our objective is to compound capital over the long term by managing a concentrated, low net exposure portfolio within a narrowly defined investment universe for which we have a deep understanding. We believe the constantly changing dynamics and complexity of the healthcare industry make it ripe for a strategy like ours that can profit from both winners and losers. We combine disciplined portfolio management with rigorous fundamental research that leverages our considerable experience investing across healthcare over many market cycles. We believe that investing our own capital alongside our partners’ ensures alignment and a focus on long-term success.North Tide is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are based in Boston, MA.

BOSTON, April 1, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- North Tide Capital Master, LP (together with its affiliates, "North Tide"), the second largest shareholder of Healthways, Inc. ("Healthways" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:   HWAY) with current ownership of approximately 11% of the outstanding shares, announced that it has filed a Preliminary Proxy Statement and Investor Presentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  
In the Investor Presentation, North Tide has outlined in detail its views regarding why significant change is necessary at Healthways, how Healthways' current management and Board is responsible for severe value destruction at the Company and how North Tide's slate of nominees is far more qualified to govern and oversee Healthways at this juncture than the incumbent nominees who North Tide is seeking to replace.
The Investor Presentation is available at the SEC's website and at the following link: http://tinyurl.com/NorthTidePresentation
North Tide is urging shareholders to elect its four highly qualified nominees, Edwin "Mac" Crawford, Bradley S. Karro, Paul H. Keckley and Conan J. Laughlin, to serve on the Company's board of directors at the upcoming 2014 Annual Meeting.

Q: What is the difference between PODS® and other types of laundry detergent?
A: PODS® detergent pacs are a super concentrated liquid detergent that is specially designed in a small and compact unit dose form to give you a great clean. They are already pre-measured so no need to measure or pour, and the pac goes directly into the back of the drum of your washing machine before adding clothes, not in the dispenser.

Q: How do Tide PODS® work?
A: Tide PODS® clean, fight stains, and brighten all in one. The unique, multi-chamber design allows ingredients to remain separate, stable, and potent—mixing only when they hit the wash for outstanding cleaning and stain removal.

Q: How do I use Tide PODS®?
A: Place a pac in the washing machine drum before you add clothes (never add Tide PODS® to the dosing drawer). For especially dirty loads, you can add a second pac.

Q: Do Tide PODS® work in front- and top-loading machines?
A: Yes, Tide PODS® work well in standard and high efficiency machines. The formula is designed to prevent over-sudsing while also giving a great clean.

Q: Will Tide PODS® dissolve in cold water?
A: Yes, the film is designed to dissolve in all water temperatures, hot or cold.

Q: Do Tide PODS® work equally well on whites and colors?
A: Yes. Tide PODS® have been thoroughly tested on all sorts of laundry conditions, and are safe for both whites and colors.

Q: Should I worry about staining or residues?
A: No. Tide PODS® are designed to dissolve completely in all water temperatures, and will not stain your clothes when used as directed.

We're so sorry this was happening! The good news is this residue is not permanent and can be removed by soaking the garment in the hottest water safe for the fabrics for a least 1 hour and then rewashing according to care tag label.

Pods remain on clothes





I have used the Pods for several years now and it seems like in the last 6 months or so I wind up having to rewash clothes. I also ruined a sweater that stained bluish/purple.
I am going to use the pods I have left and move onto something else.

Every Tide detergent contains many ingredients with long, complicated names. So you have a better idea of what does what, here is a list of the most common ingredients in Tide detergents. 
Alcohol Ethoxylate (AE)
A non-ionic surfactant. Surfactants allow water and grease to mix, helping to remove greasy stains from your garments.
Alkyl Ethoxy Sulfate (AES) and Alkyl Sulfate (AS)
Two anionic surfactants that help liquid detergents bind to impurities in fabrics. They are two of the most widely used tools for removing stains.
Amine Oxide
An amphoteric surfactant, commonly used in detergents and shampoos. Used along with other surfactants to remove stains. Can be anionic, cationic or non-ionic.
Citric Acid
Found in lemons and citrus fruits, it’s mild and helps to remove bad smells from clothes. Known as a chelating agent, which is used to soften water.
Cyclodextrin
Another chelating agent that removes malodors from garments.
Enzymes
Naturally occurring proteins that break down stains into smaller pieces to make stains easier to remove.
Ethanol
A clear, colorless alcohol used as a solvent in detergents.
Hydrogen Peroxide
One of the simplest and most common bleaching agents.
Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS)
The most widely used anionic surfactant in the world. Removes stains from your garments.
Percarbonate
Sodium percabonate is a bleaching agent used in detergents.
Perfumes
Provide pleasant, calming, joyful scents released from product itself and from fabric.
Polyethylene Glycols (PEG), Polyethylene Oxide (PEO) or Polyoxyethylene (POE)
A polyether compound used for many things, including as a lubricant and surfactant.
Polymers
Penetrate soils and break them up making the soils easier to remove and help prevent stains from re-depositing on  fabrics.
Polyvinyl Alcohol
A water-soluble synthetic polymer used to make the casing for liquid tabs and Tide PODS®.

Q: What is new Tide purclean™?
A: Tide purclean™ is the first bio-based detergent with the trusted cleaning power of Tide. Tide purclean™ delivers superior stain removal and cleans well in energy-saving cold water.  In fact, Tide purclean™ cleans as well as Tide Original Laundry Detergent.   With 65% bio-based ingredients, as certified by the USDA BioPreferred program, Tide purclean™ aims to set the performance standard for natural detergents and in turn bring more consumers to the natural detergent category.
Q: Why is Tide choosing to launch a natural detergent?
A: We believe the best way to help create a more sustainable future is to make the products that people use and love every day better. Tide purclean™ is the next step in our journey to create detergents that help consumers make sustainable choices. We are exploring using more natural ingredients not only because of the positive impacts an increased use of renewable materials will have on the environment and the sustainability of our business, long-term, but also because more and more consumers are seeking out natural ingredients in their products. After all, a more sustainable detergent can only have impact if people use it!
Q: How is new Tide purclean™ different from Base Tide?  What changes did you make to the formula?
A: Tide purclean™ is the first bio-based detergent with the cleaning power of Tide, containing 65% bio-based ingredients.  The Tide purclean™ formulation includes plant-based surfactants and solvents. Both formulas are held to the highest standards of safety and efficacy, but Tide purclean™ offers an option for consumers seeking a simple step to integrate renewable biobased products into their daily routines that meet their cleaning expectations.
Q: Does this really clean as well as Tide? (vs. Tide Original)
A: Yes! When we set out to develop Tide purclean™, our goal was to create a detergent we’d be proud to have in the Tide family.
Q: Does Tide purclean™ clean in cold water?
A: Yes. Our formulators have designed Tide purclean™ to clean even in cold water, helping you to do your part in energy conservation via cold-water washing.  Heating wash water is the largest driver of energy consumption when running your washing machine.  All the steps your take toward preserving the planet for future generations add up to make a meaningful impact.
Q: Is Tide purclean™ designed for High Efficiency machines and traditional top loading machines?
A: Yes, it provides outstanding cleaning performance in all types of machines.
Q: What is required for a product to qualify for the USDA BioPreferred designation?
A: To achieve the USDA BioPreferred seal, the product must be at least 34% bio-based. Tide Purclean™ is 65% bio-based, certified by the USDA BioPreferred program, meaning the current formulation contains nearly twice the bio-based content required for certification.
Q: Should I use Tide purclean™ for all my loads?
A: Tide purclean™ is safe for all your loads.  It is packed with bio-based cleaning  ingredients that will keep your whites white, colors bright, and your clothes looking and smelling clean and fresh.

Not happy with this product!





Washed my clothes in this twice and my son's socks still were dirty & smelly. Had to use a different Tide to get the smell and dirt out of the clothes. Left with 2 useless bottles of this stuff!

Great for Large loads, bad for small loads





Overall, great product. However, be wary with SMALL loads! Use very little! I washed 2 small loads, and got LOTS of suds in my machine. I had to wash them a 2nd time to get rid of the suds/residue!

You can expect to see more suds with Tide purclean compared to our traditional formulas. To avoid this, we recommend paying close attention to the dosing guidelines listed on the back of the bottle and not exceeding the dose required for your load size. As long as you use only the recommend amount for your size of load, you should be able to wash all load sizes without any issues.

Love this Tide





I love this new Honey & Lavender Tide scent. I'm not sure about the issues with too many suds, I don't need that much to get my clothes clean. I wish there was a fabric softener that matches!
