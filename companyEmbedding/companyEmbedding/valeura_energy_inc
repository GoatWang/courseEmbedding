How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System and National Policy 11-203 Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions -- exemption from the requirement under Part 8 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations to include financial statements in a Business Acquisition Report -- Filer will provide alternative disclosure on the basis that the acquisition was in substance an acquisition by the Filer of an interest in oil and gas properties.
Applicable Legislative Provisions
National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations, Part 8.
Citation: Valeura Energy Inc., Re, 2011 ABASC 357
June 28, 2011

IN THE MATTER OF
THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF
ALBERTA AND ONTARIO
(the Jurisdictions)
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
THE PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF
APPLICATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
VALEURA ENERGY INC.
(the Filer)
DECISION
Background
The securities regulatory authority or regulator in each of the Jurisdictions (the Decision Maker) has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdictions (the Legislation) exempting the Filer from the requirement to include in a business acquisition report (BAR) certain financial statements and information as required under National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations (NI 51-102) in respect of a significant acquisition made by the Filer, on the condition that the Filer include in the BAR certain alternative financial information as more particularly described below (the Exemption Sought).
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a dual application):

(a) the Alberta Securities Commission is the principal regulator for this application;
(b) the Filer has provided notice that Subsection 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon in British Columbia and Saskatchewan; and
(c) this decision is the decision of the principal regulator and evidences the decision of the securities regulatory authority or regulator in Ontario.

Interpretation
Terms defined in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions, MI 11-102 or NI 51-102 have the same meaning if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined herein.
Representations
This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:

The Filer
1. The Filer was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) and its head office is in Calgary, Alberta.
2. The Filer is engaged in the exploration, development and production of petroleum and natural gas in Turkey and Western Canada.
3. The Filer is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario, and is not, to its knowledge, in default of its obligations as a reporting issuer under the securities legislation of any of the jurisdictions in which it is a reporting issuer.
4. The Filer is a venture issuer.
The Acquisition
5. Pursuant to certain transactions and agreements, the Filer purchased particular oil and gas lands and assets located in Turkey (the Assets) on June 8, 2011. The Assets were owned by Thrace Basin Natural Gas Turkiye Corporation (TBNG) and Pinnacle Turkey Inc. (PTI). TBNG and PTI were wholly-owned by Mustafa Mehmet Corporation (MMC).
6. Due to tax, foreign ownership and government approval considerations, the purchase by the Filer of the Assets (the Acquisition) was structured in a certain manner, such that rather than the Filer acquiring the Assets directly, the Filer acquired the Assets via purchasing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Corporate Resources B.V. (Subco).
7. Subco was incorporated on September 11, 2001 as a shelf company by the Dutch trust company, BFT Nederland B.V.
8. MMC purchased Subco on April 18, 2011 for the sole purpose of facilitating the Acquisition.
9. In contemplation of and prior to the Acquisition, the Assets were transferred to Subco.
10. When Subco was purchased by MMC, Subco had no assets (other than a small amount of cash) and no liabilities. At closing of the Acquisition the only assets of Subco were the Assets.
11. The Acquisition constitutes a significant acquisition for the Filer within the meaning of Part 8 of NI 51-102. Accordingly, the Filer is required to file a BAR in respect of the Acquisition.
12. The financial year end of both the Filer and Subco is December 31.
13. Section 8.4 of NI 51-102 would require the Filer to include certain financial statements and other information in the BAR, including:

(a) an audited statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for Subco's most recently completed financial year ended on or before the acquisition date, and an audited statement of financial position for Subco as at the end of that year;
(b) an unaudited statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for Subco's financial year immediately preceding its most recently completed financial year, and an unaudited statement of financial position for Subco as at the end of that year;
(c) an interim financial report for Subco for the most recently completed interim period that started the day after the date of the most recent statement of financial position specified above and ended before the acquisition date, as well as interim financial information for the comparable period in the preceding financial year;
(d) a pro forma statement of financial position of the Filer as at the date of the Filer's most recent statement of financial position filed, that gives effect, as if they had taken place as at the date of that pro forma statement of financial position, to significant acquisitions that have been completed, but are not reflected in the Filer's most recent statement of financial position for an annual or interim period;
(e) a pro forma income statement of the Filer for the Filer's most recently completed financial year for which it has filed financial statements, that gives effect to significant acquisitions completed since the beginning of that financial year as if they had taken place at the beginning of that financial year;
(f) a pro forma income statement of the Filer for the Filer's most recently completed interim period for which it has filed financial statements that started after the period referred to in paragraph (e) above, and ended before the acquisition date, that gives effect to significant acquisitions completed since the beginning of the financial year referred to in paragraph (e) above as if they had taken place at the beginning of that interim period; and
(g) pro forma earnings per share based on the pro forma financial statements referred to in paragraphs (e) and (f) above.

14. Section 8.10(3) of NI 51-102 provides an exemption from the financial statement requirements that would otherwise apply under Section 8.4 of NI 51-102 if the significant acquisition is of a business that is an interest in an oil and gas property, provided that, among other things: (i) the acquisition is not an acquisition of securities of another issuer; and (ii) the BAR includes historical operating statements in respect of the assets purchased and pro forma operating statements of the issuer.
15. Although the Acquisition was made via the purchase of securities of another issuer (Subco), the Acquisition was, in substance, an acquisition by the Filer of oil and gas properties constituting a business. At the time of the Acquisition, the other conditions specified in Section 8.10(3) were met.
16. The Filer proposes to include the disclosure specified by Section 8.10(3) of NI 51-102 in the BAR to be filed in respect of the Acquisition, namely:

(a) an audited operating statement pertaining to the Assets presenting gross revenues, royalty expenses, production costs and operating income for the period that is the same as Subco's most recently completed financial year ended on or before the acquisition date;
(b) an unaudited operating statement pertaining to the Assets presenting gross revenues, royalty expenses, production costs and operating income for the period that is the same as Subco's financial year immediately preceding its most recently completed financial year;
(c) an unaudited operating statement pertaining to the Assets presenting gross revenues, royalty expenses, production costs and operating income for the period that is the same as Subco's most recently completed interim period that started after the period referred to in paragraph (a) above and ended before the acquisition date;
(d) a pro forma operating statement of the Filer for the Filer's most recently completed financial year for which financial statements are required to have been filed, that gives effect to significant acquisitions completed since the beginning of that financial year as if they had taken place at the beginning of that financial year;
(e) a pro forma operating statement of the Filer for the Filer's most recently completed interim period for which it has filed an interim financial report that began after the period referred to in paragraph (d) above and ended before the acquisition date, that gives effect to significant acquisitions completed since the beginning of the financial year referred to in paragraph (d) above as if they had taken place at the beginning of that interim period;
(f) a description of the Assets and the interest acquired therein;
(g) disclosure of the annual oil and gas production volumes from the Assets for the periods referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above;
(h) the estimated reserves and related future net revenue attributable to the Assets, the material assumptions used in preparing the estimates, and the relationship, if any, between the person who prepared the estimates and any of the Filer, TBNG, PTI or MMC; and
(i) the estimated oil and gas production volumes from the Assets for the first year reflected in the estimates disclosed under paragraph (h) above;

(collectively, the Alternative Disclosure).

Decision
Each of the Decision Makers is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the Decision Maker to make the decision.
The decision of the Decision Makers under the Legislation is that the Exemption Sought is granted provided that the Filer includes the Alternative Disclosure in the BAR to be filed in respect of the Acquisition.

Company Profile

Valeura Energy Inc. ("Valeura" or "the Company") is a Canada-based public company engaged in the exploration, development and production of petroleum and natural gas in Turkey.  The Company’s shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") in Canada under the trading symbol VLE.
Since Valeura was established in 2010, the Company has executed a number of transactions and currently holds interests in 21 production leases and exploration licences in the Thrace Basin of Turkey totaling 0.53 MM acres (gross) or on a net basis 0.43 MM acres of shallow rights and 0.35 MM net acres of deep rights (net after the impact of the TBNG Acquisition and West Thrace Deep Rights Sale. The Company’s small legacy oil and gas properties in Canada were sold in the Q3 2014.
Valeura is pursuing high operating netback natural gas in Turkey, including conventional shallow natural gas, unconventional tight gas and a potentially significant basin-centered gas play in the Thrace Basin. By applying 3D seismic, modern fracture stimulation technology and horizontal and deeper vertical well drilling, Valeura is aiming to achieve commercial scale operations from this tight gas resource and expand conventional natural gas operations by applying new exploration concepts. This upstream program is complemented by ownership of gas gathering and sales infrastructure to support direct marketing of natural gas to end users.

Valeura’s petroleum and natural gas sales in the Thrace Basin of Turkey in the Q1 2017 averaged 807 boe/d, including 4.8 MMcf/d of natural gas at a $7.06 per Mcf natural. Natural gas sales represent more than 99% of net petroleum and natural gas sales.

Financial Information

In conjunction with the Arrangement in April 2010, Valeura completed a $6.0 million private placement to recapitalize the Company, of which approximately 50% was funded by management, directors, and employees, wherein 30 million shares were issued at $0.20 per share (pre-Share Consolidation basis).
On April 16, 2010, the Company also closed a bought deal financing with investors, in Canada and Europe, of 51.1 million special warrants at $0.47 per warrant (pre- Share Consolidation basis), which provided gross proceeds of $24.0 million. Each warrant converted to 1.0 share on May 21, 2010 on issuance of a final prospectus.
In conjunction with the TBNG-PTI acquisition, the Company completed a bought deal private placement on February 28, 2011 of 265,384,350 Subscription Receipts (pre- Share Consolidation basis) priced at $0.325 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of $86.25 million.  Each Subscription Receipt entitled the holder thereof, upon the satisfaction of certain escrow release conditions, to automatically receive one Common Share and one-half of one financing warrant of the Company.  The Financing Warrants were not re-issued following the Company's Share Consolidation, which was completed on September 15, 2011. Therefore, on a post- Share Consolidation basis, the holder of Financing Warrants is entitled to exchange 10 Financing Warrants to acquire one Common Share at a price of $5.50 per Common Share, for a period of 60 months from the closing date of the Subscription Receipts offering.  The Company will have the right to accelerate the expiry date of the Financing Warrants to 30 days from the date of notice once the 20 day volume weighted average price of the Company Common Shares on the TSX has become equal to or greater than $11.00 per Common Share.  The Financing Warrants expired on February 29, 2016. 
On September 17, 2012, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters to purchase, on a "bought deal" basis, 11.5 million Common Shares of Valeura at a price of $1.30 per Common Share, for gross proceeds of $14.95 million.  The financing closed on October 10, and 11.5 million Common Shares were issued at a price of $1.30 per Common Share, for net proceeds of approximately $13.8 million after fees and expenses.
On October 13 and 14, 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters (collectively, the "Underwriters") for an underwritten private placement of 14,629,000 subscription receipts priced at $0.75 per subscription receipt for gross proceeds of approximately $11 million (the "Offering"). Each subscription receipt represented the right to receive one common share of the Company without the payment of any additional consideration or further action, upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The Offering was completed on February 24, 2017 and 14,629,000 common shares were issued increasing the number of outstanding common shares of the Company to 73,148,321.
Management and directors own approximately 4.9% of the shares outstanding or 10.9% on a fully diluted basis, including options issued by the Company.
The following figure illustrates the capital structure of the Company at May 23, 2017.

Valeura - A global energy company focused on exceptional value creation
Valeura Energy Inc. ("Valeura" or the "Company") is a Canada-based public company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of petroleum and natural gas in Turkey. The Company's shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada under the trading symbol VLE.
Valeura is a coined word developed to brand the new company formed by the merger of two predecessor Canadian companies in early 2010. The root word of the first syllable is "value" in English and French. The first letter "V" evokes the heritage of several members of the management team and directors who had a hand in creating significant shareholder value in previous roles with Verenex Energy Inc., Vermilion Energy Trust, and Aventura Energy Inc.

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.
