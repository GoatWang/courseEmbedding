Multimedia Gallery URLMoreOAK PARK, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UnitedHealthcare is investing $18.3 million to help build two new affordable-housing communities in Hart and Oak Park, Michigan.This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170627006564/en/ The announcement was made at a groundbreaking ceremony for Jefferson Oaks in Oak Park, where community leaders and investment partners celebrated the start of construction for the 60-unit mixed-income community. UnitedHealthcare is investing $14.6 million in the Oak Park development. Cinnaire is providing a $2.3 million permanent loan to the project.Jefferson Oaks, developed by Community Housing Network Inc. (CHN), is being built on the site of a vacant school building and campus, which will be transformed into 20 apartments and eight new townhome-style buildings with an additional 40 homes. Twenty-one of the apartments are set aside for supportive housing. When completed in 2018, the new community will include on-site support services and amenities such as a community room with a library, computer lab and meeting space, and a playground.“We are very excited to start the construction of this new community in Oak Park and appreciate the work of UnitedHealthcare, Cinnaire and our other partners in helping make this groundbreaking possible,” said Marc Craig, president of Community Housing Network. “When completed next year, Jefferson Oaks will be a model community that brings quality homes with on-site amenities for individuals and families who want a wonderful place to live and play.”UnitedHealthcare also announced a $3.7 million investment in Woodland Place Apartments in Hart. The new 24-unit apartment community, developed by Gryphon Group LLC and Oceana County Housing Commission, will include 12 units for people living with special needs and struggling with homelessness. The development is being built to U.S. Green Building Council LEED environmental standards. West Michigan Community Mental Health will provide supportive services and case management for residents. Woodland Place Apartments will open in 2018.“UnitedHealthcare’s investments to support affordable housing in Michigan are part of our initiative to help people live healthier lives by connecting them to housing, health care and other important services,” said Dennis Mouras, CEO, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Michigan, which employs 1,100 people in Michigan and serves the health care needs of more than 800,000 people in the state. “We are grateful for the opportunity to work with these partners to expand affordable housing in Michigan.”The Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) approved the use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits for the new developments, with Minnesota Equity Fund (MEF) and Cinnaire securing the equity funding from UnitedHealthcare. MEF and Cinnaire support community stabilization and economic development through partnerships with investors and mission-focused organizations through the use of federal tax credits and by providing creative loans, investments and best-in-class services to partners.“Today marks an important milestone in helping create new models for quality, affordable housing in Michigan,” said Earl Poleski, executive director, MSHDA. “Jefferson Oaks will provide new hope and opportunity for the families and individuals who get to call it home.”“Cinnaire partners with socially motivated companies like UnitedHealthcare to make economic investments in well-designed, high-quality affordable-housing developments,” said Mark McDaniel, president and CEO of Cinnaire. “These investments will help meet a critical need in Michigan to provide low-income individuals with quality, permanent housing with supportive services. We appreciate the commitment UnitedHealthcare has made to investing in affordable housing and creating healthy, vibrant communities.”Last year, UnitedHealthcare invested $16.5 million in two new affordable-housing communities in Ypsilanti and Holt. A ribbon-cutting celebration was held today for one of those developments – Prestwick Village in Holt, a new 66-unit affordable-housing community with support services that provides new housing opportunities for individuals and families, including veterans struggling with homelessness and people with disabilities. UnitedHealthcare invested $8.5 million in Prestwick Village, which was developed by Gryphon Group and constructed by T.R. Hovey Construction LLC.Read MoreUnitedHealthcare has provided more than $350 million in financing since 2011 for 56 housing development projects in 14 states, creating more than 2,700 affordable-housing units.

Our StoryOaktree Products, Inc. serves as a resource for audiologists and other hearing health care professionals with a commitment to providing the highest level of customer service. As a mutli-line distributor of hearing health care products, the company offers over 4200 different products intended for use in the clinical environment or for resale to patients. In addition, Oaktree Products is a resource to the hearing industry and hearing health care professionals, offering information, product solutions, and technical training/education in various areas of clinical practice including hearing assistance technology, cerumen management, and infection control.Planting of Initial SeedsEstablished in 1992, company founder and CEO Bob Kemp recognized that the scope of practice for audiology was expanding to include cerumen management. To assist in meeting their needs, Oaktree Products introduced a cerumen softening system called Audiologist’s Choice®. As more audiologist became involved in cerumen management, Bob, a microbiologist, recognized that infection control received very little attention both in graduate training programs and at the professional level. In response to this need, Oaktree Products started educating audiologists and dispensing professionals in the area of infection control. In response to these efforts, the demand for infection control products for use or resale grew.Growing and Branching OutAs the company became more involved in selling infection control products, Oaktree Products realized that hearing health care professionals (audiologists, dispensing professionals, etc.) were looking for a “one-stop-shop” to meet their supply needs. From its original foundation of cerumen management and infection control products and services, Oaktree Products branched out to resale items, hearing assistance technology, earmold impression materials, diagnostic equipment, auditory test recordings, and educational products. Currently, Oaktree Products provides over 4200 items to customers worldwide.Why Do Business with Oaktree Products?The goal at Oaktree Products is to provide customers with information and product solutions in a friendly yet efficient manner. The company provides on-going employee training and education to ensure customers have access to the most up-to-date information on our products. Furthermore, our customer service team does not work on commission.As a small business, Oaktree Products can relate to the needs and demands of other small business owners. Oaktree Products does not require minimum orders and we will gladly break apart standard packaging to meet your needs. We are centrally located in St. Louis, MO and can ship most orders to you within 2 to 3 business days with overnight and other delivery services available. Unlike our competitors, Oaktree Products does not sell directly to the public. Finally, if you can’t find something that you are looking for, let us know. We will do the footwork for you and try our best to find it. Half of the items we currently offer are a result of someone asking us to find an item we previously did not carry.

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Oaktree Capital Group First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, but will be prompted for a question-and-answer session following the prepared remarks.
Now, I would like to introduce Andrea Williams, Oaktree's Head of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, who will host today's conference call. Ms. Williams, you may begin.
Andrea D. Williams - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Thank you, Laura, and welcome to all of you who have joined us for today's call to discuss Oaktree's first quarter 2017 financial results. Our earnings release issued this morning detailing these results may be accessed through the Unitholders section of our website. Our speakers today are Oaktree's Chief Executive Officer, Jay Wintrob; Co-Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, Bruce Karsh; and Chief Financial Officer, Dan Levin. We will be happy to take your questions following their prepared remarks.
Before we begin, I want to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, reflecting our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Important factors could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those indicated in these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. We undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
I'd also like to remind you that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in any Oaktree fund. Investors and others should note that Oaktree uses the Unitholders section of its corporate website to announce material information. Accordingly, Oaktree encourages investors, and the media and others to review the information that it shares on its corporate website at ir.oaktreecapital.com.
During our call today, we will be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measurement, please refer to our earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today on Form 8-K and may be accessed through the Unitholders section of our website. Today, we announced a quarterly distribution of $0.71 per Class A unit, payable on May 12, to holders of record as of the close of business on May 8. Finally, we plan to issue our first quarter 10-Q next week.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Thank you, Andrea, and hello to everyone. The U.S. market started strong in 2017, driven by investor optimism regarding the new administration's stated desire to lower taxes, provide strong fiscal stimulus and reduce regulations to spur growth. In this distinctly pro business environment, markets and assets have appreciated, and Oaktree has performed well.
Given that the animal spirits in the market have led to steadily higher valuations, we've taken advantage of increased opportunities to sell assets out of our closed-end funds at favorable prices. At the same time, we continue to deploy capital across all of our strategies in a disciplined and cautious manner with a focus on controlling risk and limiting the downside. All-in-all, realizations exceeded investments by a widening margin in the first quarter, and we believe this was the correct posture to take for our clients.

Our strong financial performance this quarter was highlighted by 54% growth in adjusted net income and 25% growth in distributable earnings, both versus the same period a year ago. These results were driven by higher incentive and investment income as we benefited from continued strong investment performance and significant realization activity in our Distressed Debt and other closed-end funds. Additionally, our share of DoubleLine's net income, which we account for as investment income, continues to fuel our distributable earnings.
We deem superior investment performance with risk under control to be the most important thing we focus on at Oaktree. During the first quarter, we achieved satisfactory results. Our closed-end funds generated an aggregate gross return of 3%, bringing the last 12 months return to 16%. These returns, coupled with continued strong performance across our evergreen strategies, highlight the power of our incentive-creating fund platform. In the first quarter, we created net incentives of $97 million and net accrued incentives have increased by 30% over the past 12 months.
In terms of fund raising, gross capital raised in the first quarter was $3.1 billion, bringing this figure for the prior 12 months to $13 billion. During the first quarter, closed-end capital raise included final commitments of $500 million for Opportunities Fund Xb, bringing total committed capital for that fund to $8.9 billion. Of the 127 Private Debt funds that closed in the last year, Opps Xb was the largest. It's worth noting some of the statistics for the successful fund raised, as they make clear the depth, breadth and diversity of Oaktree's client relationships around the globe.
Over 330 limited partners committed to the fund and 107 of those were new clients to Oaktree. Thus, the Opps Funds continue to function as relationship starters for us, as they have for 28 years. About 27% of the capital raised was from clients based outside of the Americas, a higher percentage than for Opportunities Fund IX. Consistent with the previous funds, the largest contributors of capital were public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies. We see our fund-raising success in Distressed Debt as a direct result of the disciplined and patient approach we've taken in deploying capital over our history and, of course, in delivering strong risk-adjusted returns.
Of all of the 57 closed-end funds created since Oaktree's founding, none have lost money for our clients on a gross basis, demonstrating our adherence to the primacy of risk control throughout our history. Meanwhile, we continue to make progress in fund-raising for other funds such as European Principal Fund IV, which has reached approximately €1.1 billion in committed capital as of March 31; and the European Capital Solutions private loan fund, which completed fund-raising this quarter with a total of approximately €700 million.
We continue fund-raising for our various real estate vehicles, including Real Estate Debt Fund II, currently at €765 million in commitments; as well as raising our first evergreen Real Estate Income Fund and we continue to fund-raise for Middle-Market Direct Lending Fund and Emerging Market Debt Total Return Funds.
In terms of our first infrastructure fund-raise, after receiving significant LP demand for a fund targeting transportation assets, we decided to reposition Infrastructure Fund I into two separate fund vehicles with specific sector focuses. Given the transportation, infrastructure teams' differentiated expertise in public, private partnerships and strong historical investment performance across the entire transport spectrum of land, sea and air, this quarter we'll begin marketing the first and only U.S.-dedicated Transportation Infrastructure Fund.

Concurrently, we'll launch an energy-focused fund to invest in power and midstream infrastructure investments, primarily in North America, where we believe infrastructure is positioned for a surge of activity. We're optimistic about the prospects for the infrastructure strategy with the relaunch of these two sector funds.
Turning to open-end funds, we experienced net outflows of roughly $1 billion for the quarter, the majority of which were in high-yield bonds and convertibles. Some clients have reduced their exposure to high-yield bonds given the very strong recent performance of the asset class and the limited opportunity for capital appreciation at current pricing.
Convertibles outflows were driven by two primary factors: a shrinking market size and some performance challenges in our U.S. Convertible strategy. Using Morningstar data as a reference point, we note that U.S. High Yield and Convertibles mutual funds also experienced net outflows during the first quarter.
Counterbalancing this trend has been continued inflows to our open-end European Senior Loan strategy, where we've seen positive flows both directly from institutional investors and via our CCAV (09:21) platform. And finally, we also remain active in marketing our new Global Credit Fund, a vehicle that combines the full breadth of Oaktree's more liquid credit strategies within a relative value framework based on a dynamic asset allocation process overseen by our Chief Investment Officer, Bruce Karsh. Clients' initial reactions to this multi-asset strategy have been quite favorable and we're now finalizing our first separate accounts. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our Global Credit Fund in the coming quarters.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bruce to cover the investment landscape.
Bruce Karsh - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Thanks, Jay, and hello, everyone. As Jay mentioned, owing to investors' expectations that the administration's pro-business agenda will fuel economic growth in the U.S., many risk assets began the year in an impressive fashion. The S&P 500's total return was 6.1% in the first quarter, its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2015. High-yield bonds also extended the rally, meaningfully outpacing their investment-grade counterparts.
However, after enjoying outsized returns through the first two months of the period, optimism gave way to skepticism and volatility in March, with credit markets and high-yield bonds in particular, under pressure in sympathy with lower oil prices, declining equities and a rally in U.S. Treasuries. After a price collapse in the first half of March, high-yield bonds were able to recoup much of those losses by month end and return 2.4% for the quarter.
Emerging Markets performed especially well during the first quarter, outperforming developed markets by about 5% on the equity front. In part, this rally represented a recovery from the sell-off that followed the U.S. Presidential election. In addition, stronger-than-expected economic growth, rising earnings expectations, strengthening currencies and continued growth in China, all supported commodity prices and raised hopes for an acceleration of global growth. Against this general backdrop, our Emerging Markets Debt and Equity strategies fared very well with returns ranging from 8% to more than 12% gross in the first quarter.
Given the lofty valuations we see across our credit universe, the opportunity in traded credit for our current Distressed Debt Opportunities Funds has largely disappeared, since it ballooned in early 2016. Several of the energy and commodity-related securities that we purchased during the first quarter of last year rallied significantly, and our Opportunities Fund Xa was able to realize a considerable amount of profits.

So, where do we stand today? Absent an exogenous shock to the economy, we continue to see a very benign default environment. Although there may be more bankruptcies in the retail space, we wouldn't be surprised if the 2017 high-yield bond default rate is in the 2% range. That would be about half last year's rate, which primarily consisted of defaults from the energy sector. And the eighth year in a row of defaults below the long-term average of around 4%.
This environment, as we said last quarter, is not conducive to the commencement of a larger Distressed Debt Fund, such as our $8.9 billion Opps Xb. Meanwhile, we can and will continue to recycle the gains in Opps Xa and are focused on select situational distress across a variety of industries such as retail, healthcare and energy.
So as we mentioned last quarter, assuming market conditions stay the same, our current estimate for the official inception of the investment period for Opps Xb and thus, the commencement of charging management fees on committed capital, is likely to start sometime in 2018. While we wait for a larger opportunity set, we will continue to realize and harvest assets across our closed-end funds. As Jay mentioned, our status as a net-seller continued in the first quarter, as we realize substantially more than we invested across our closed-end funds.
So far in the second quarter, we are continuing the successful harvesting of fully valued portfolio holdings. As you may recall, last July, we highlighted the successful IPO of AdvancePierre Foods, a portfolio company of our Special Situations Group. As a reminder, the legacy company, Pierre Foods was a classic distressed-for-control situation, wherein 2008 the team invested $100 million to acquire the business through bankruptcy for an effective purchase price for the whole company of $170 million.
This week, APF announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Tyson Foods for a total enterprise value of $4.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the current quarter and the total cash received from this investment will represent approximately 23 times our invested capital and generate $2.2 billion in profits for an IRR of over 90%. Clearly, one of the all-time great private equity investments and certainly the standout in the history of Oaktree, it's even more astounding to note that this is not a high-tech company, but a prosaic food producer and distributor.
Needless to say, we're proud of the key architect, Matt Wilson, and the strong team who helped bring about the outstanding result. They identified an attractive distressed-for-control opportunity, made multiple bolt-on acquisitions and one transformational one, and most importantly, added material value to this portfolio company through hands-on financial and operational expertise.
Matt, being from Cleveland, is on Cloud Nine at the multiple of invested capital figure of 23x (15:57) happens to be LeBron James' jersey number; and Michael Jordan's as well for those non-Cav fans out there. But being a Warrior fan myself, I told him his next goal should be Steph Curry's jersey number, 30.
I look forward to answering your questions, but now I'm delighted to turn the call over to Dan.
Daniel Dane Levin - Oaktree Capital Management LP
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter's financial results reflected continued strong investment performance across fund categories. Adjusted net income, distributable earnings, economic net income and net accrued incentives, all grew substantially over the same period a year ago.
I'll focus your attention on three prevalent themes that continued in our first quarter results. One, a disciplined approach to deployment of capital. Two, significant realization activity across our closed-end funds as illustrated by $2.6 billion of distributions in the quarter, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2014. And three, near-record levels of dry powder, signaling our preparedness for change in market conditions.

Management fees in the first quarter declined by $16 million from the same period a year ago. The decline was primarily the result of a number of funds entering the liquidation period in the second half of 2016, such as Real Estate Fund VI, European Principal Fund III and Highstar Fund IV and our posture as a net seller in many of our closed-end fund strategies.
While our management fees have been pressured in the current environment, this same environment provides an attractive backdrop for growing the value of net accrued status and our balance sheet investment, which bodes well for future distributable earning.
Moving to fee-related earning, for the first quarter, FRE declined 23% from the same period a year ago, primarily as a result of the lower management fees I just mentioned. While prudent cost management has been a particular focus over the last couple of years, we manage those costs with a focus on the long-term need and growth prospects of the business. Thus, we don't look to dramatically lower cost when revenue's low for cyclical reasons. We are committed to building a stronger and more scalable platform for growth.
Incentive income grew 52% over the year-ago period, benefiting from our increased realization activity, particularly in a Distressed Debt and Real Estate Funds. Tax-related incentive distributions contributed 55% of incentive income in the first quarter, down from 75% in the year-ago period.
Investment income was strong in the first quarter at $58 million, reflecting our funds' solid investment performance and our 20% ownership stake in DoubleLine, whose assets under management were $105 billion at the end of the quarter. DoubleLine contributed $16 million to investment income in Q1 and $67 million over the last 12 months.
Our funds' robust investment performance also benefited incentives created and, therefore, total accrued incentives and off-balance sheet asset that represents potential future incentive income. Net accrued incentives grew 2% sequentially in the first quarter and 30% over the last year to $969 million or $6.22 per operating group unit.
Of this amount, 91% resides in closed-end funds that are in liquidation, boding well for distributable earning and equity distributions over the next few years. The increasing diversity of this pool of potential incentive income is notable. With over 40% represented by control investing strategies and nearly 20% represented by real estate.
If you were to look at this balance three- and five-years ago, Distressed Debt Funds represented 69% and 78%, respectively, compared to 34% today. For the first quarter, we generated $157 million in distributable earnings or $0.86 per Class A unit. We declared a distribution of $0.71 per Class A unit in the quarter, which brings our distribution over the last 12 months to $2.57, up 34% over the previous 12-month period.
In summary, 2017 is off to a solid start in terms of adjusted net income, distributable earnings, investment performance, fund-raising and accrued incentives. We continue to be disciplined with our pace of investment and, therefore, we reiterate our comments from prior quarters that we do not expect significant growth in our management fees until the start of Opps Xb investment period.
Our continued near-record level of dry powder is strong assurance that we are well positioned for any changes in the investment environment and our continued harvesting of investments in our more mature funds bode well for future distributable earnings.
With respect to the second quarter to date, our known fund-related investment income proceeds are $5 million and we have no meaningful, no net incentive income thus far. Looking out to the rest of the quarter, as Bruce discussed, Tyson Foods announced that it entered into a purchase agreement with AdvancePierre Foods, our largest holding in Principal Fund IV.

Our current estimate is that upon closing, which currently is expected later this quarter, assuming completion of the tender offer and that customary closing conditions are satisfied, this disposition will generate approximately $20 million of receipts of investment income and at least $150 million of net incentive income.
With that, we're delighted to take your questions. So Laura, please open up the lines.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Maybe first question, just on the exit activity and the realization outlook. I guess, maybe two portions to that. First, when I look at the net accrued, that has increased a ton over the last year. And just trying to gauge the portion that when you're selling, I think, it was 19% that you can realize right away versus the other portion, you still have to kind of payout the LPs before you realize the incentive. So, anyway to kind of gauge the timing on that, like the 19% versus the full $900 million or so?
Daniel Dane Levin - Oaktree Capital Management LP
Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question. So, as you mentioned, there is 19% that's currently paying, but we're also making good progress on the number of other funds in terms of getting to the point that they are paying. And so, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that upon the disposition of AdvancePierre, we expect that Principal Fund IV will start generating incentive income and that is about 26% of our gross accrued incentives. And so, assuming that closes in the quarter, we expect that that will be paying as of the end of the second quarter.
Additionally, there's a few other funds, Real Estate Fund V and Power III, that continue to make good progress at moving toward the point they're paying. And that's why I think as a theme across all our comments, we mentioned that the realization activity bodes well for kind of future cash flow and distributable earnings.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the follow-up, just on the fund-raising, it seems like you guys have a lot of products that are out there and you're making some progress. On the open-end side, you mentioned whether it's on the high-yield that converts some pressure there. So, when we think about the outlook over the next year or so, how do you see that kind of playing out? Meaning, the activity that you guys are in the market with versus maybe ongoing pressures on the business. And just, strategically, is there anything more that can be done, maybe from a net basis, maybe expanding at a faster pace?
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Thanks, Mike. Look, I think when it comes to open-end fund flows, the two key factors, obviously, are investment performance, but also the state of the markets. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also take a look at, just as a data point, what's happening with U.S. mutual fund flows through Morningstar data. And for the most part, our experience is consistent with that experience. Knowing specifically why our clients are investing and/or redeeming, it's pretty clear to us in the high-yield side that almost all of the redemptions we've experienced have been clients reallocating out of the asset class, hopefully, temporarily because of the incredibly strong run that high-yield bonds have had, probably in large part is due to what Bruce mentioned, historically, low default rates, half the historical rate for the last eight years.
And at this point, given the pricing in the market, it's hard to see much capital appreciation. Convertibles a little bit of a different story. The overall convertibles market, unlike the high-yield market, has actually shrunk, I think, something like 40% over the last several years, the entire market. And we've experienced some of that shrinkage due to that, because we choose not to be larger than a set percentage of the total market. But also with our U.S. Convert product, we've had some performance issues, we've taken actions here earlier actually last quarter. And we're quite optimistic that going forward, we'll have improvement on that. So, I think it's really, again, mainly up to the markets in terms of the pricing of the securities and to also an equal extent, but sometimes we can't even offset the markets, is our own investment performance and high yield's a good example of that.

Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
I think I – yeah, I want to add one other comment, because it's worth noting that the Global Credit Fund, which is our multi-strategy offering of kind of our more liquid principally open-end strategies, is going to play a big part, in our view, of our ability to continue gathering assets going forward in a different kind of a fund, obviously, where we're going to depend on asset allocation, dynamic rebalancing, relative value analysis. So, as I mentioned, we're just finalizing the first separate accounts for that fund and I think we'll have good news to report over the next several quarters on our progress there. And that will help in a way feed assets into several of the open-end strategies that we just referred to.
Operator
And our next question will come from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Did any of the funds have a final close in 1Q? I'm just looking at the raises across European Principal and some of the other products. I'm just wondering any of them were final?
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Hey, Craig. Good morning. Jay. The ECS, European Capital Solutions Direct Lending Fund had a final close. And I think I mentioned that the final assets there were about €765 million. And then the other fund that had a final close in the first quarter was Opps Xb with the $8.9 billion final amount.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks, Jay. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator
The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just going back, I guess, to the timing on Xb and kind of the pace of capital deployment. So, all that makes sense. I think in the past you guys said that you still anticipate given kind of the current environment to turn the fuse on early in 2018. It sounds like it's a little less certain. I think you guys just kind of move to at some point of 2018. I guess; A, am I thinking about that correctly? And B, if this ends up being a much more prolong cycle of low default rates, could we anticipate you guys, potentially, returning some of that capital back to LPs?
Bruce Karsh - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Hi, Alex. It's Bruce. Well, let's just start with what a difference a year makes. A year ago, if you looked at the high yield bond market, there were probably 20% or more of the entire universe trading at stressed levels, meaning 1,000 basis points over the curve. Today, it's probably 2% or less, something like that. So, lot of things can change in a very short period of time. We have no idea what's going to happen 6 or 12 or 18 months from now, but our LPs are very, very patient and we've talked to our largest ones this week. We had a LPAC meeting, went very well. We talked about our projections in terms of timing for turning on Xb. I think they were very satisfied that we're exhibiting discipline and patience. And I think they were also very satisfied that we're doing what we should be doing, which is realizing fully valued holdings in earlier funds and finding opportunities to deploy and recycle our existing Xa.
So, there's really no pressure for us to do anything other than do the right thing. And there is no need for us to give back capital and I don't think there is any desire on the part of the LPs for us to do so.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yeah, that all makes sense. Thanks for the answer.
Operator
Next, we have a question from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, if you can talk a little bit about the fee-related earnings and FRE margin trajectory from here, just given the strong pace of harvesting activities and the fees on the Opps Xb Fund, not likely turning until 2018, just any color around the moving pieces there would be helpful.

Daniel Dane Levin - Oaktree Capital Management LP
Yeah. So, thanks, Mike. The biggest driver of our FRE margin is going to be our management fee trajectory. And so over the near term, as management fees are moderate due to our continued realization activity in our closed-end funds, you'll probably see us having lower-than-normal FRE margins. Over the intermediate term, especially, when Opps Xb starts its investment period and starts generating approximately $130 million of management fees, we expect there to be a nice step-up in FRE margins, because there is relatively modest incremental expenses related to that fund. So, I think, the longer-term prospects are bright. But over the near term, we're probably going to be at lower-the-normal levels.
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
If I could just add, Dan, on the issue of management fees being the dominant driver, absolutely, and Xb being the most important changes going to occur, again absolutely. Having said that, we have approximately $22 billion of dry powder, $13.5 billion of shadow AUM. And so, there is more of our shadow AUM than just Opps Xb. And also, there are more AUM that charges management fees on invested capital. And so, in a different environment, where deployment accelerates, there will be other drivers of management fee growth from the investment of our existing dry powder and shadow AUM.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just thinking on the other side on the – back to the fund-raising and the differentiated strategies that you've continuously launched. If you can talk a little bit about what you see as the infrastructure opportunity, the sizing of the two fleets that you mentioned today and the potential future of that given what the administration is doing. And then you also mentioned, on the new-to-firm investors on Opps Xb, to what extent do you think you can cross-sell some other strategies to those investors or do you think they're more just focused on the Distressed Funds?
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Thanks, Brian. Let me answer that in reverse order. On the new to Oaktree investors, if the past is prologue, it's likely that new investors ultimately will become repeat customers and multiple product purchasers at Oaktree. As we sit here today, close to 80% of our clients own two or more Oaktree products. I think there is something like 38% of our clients own four or more Oaktree products. And our strategy is to deliver outstanding investment performance and I think that's what primarily sells the other products. And so, if we keep doing that, I think we'll see repeat customers and customers that invest in the multiple products. And so, I think I used the term that the Opps Funds had historically served as a relationship starter for the firm, and that's the case again for Opps Xb.
I also mentioned, yeah, we think we're very optimistic about the infrastructure opportunity. First and foremost, you have to have been in a cave for some period of time not to have seen an acceleration of media coverage and discussion about the infrastructure opportunity. So, there's certainly more chatter. I think the need for infrastructure investments, especially in this country, is pretty well documented. What we found when we've been out initially fund-raising for the original Infrastructure Fund was that clients were looking for, as you mentioned, a differentiated offering and a sector-specific offering. And they honed in on our team's prior track record, in particular, in transportation; land, sea, and air, airports, rail, ports, et cetera. And so, it's with that information that we went back, examined it internally and decided to come out and relaunch two sector-specific funds, as I mentioned, transportation in the United States. And we think that's the only transportation-only fund here in the U.S. being offered. And then, energy infrastructure in midstream in North America. And in both categories, we think the demand is very large. And so, we're optimistic about our fund-raising potential over the next probably 18-month period.

Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I'm sorry, did you give any size of the potential over 18 months for those two new funds?
Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
No, we're not establishing – being it so early in the process, consistent with our past, we're not establishing any fund-raising dollar goals per fund and that includes the Transportation and Energy Infrastructure Funds.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

The next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks, guys. Regarding monetization activity, is it possible for you guys possibly to frame up how large this pipeline could be over the balance of 2017?
Bruce Karsh - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Chris, it's Bruce. That's a tough one to answer, obviously. I can tell you one thing that in Q1 of this year, we realized in our closed-end funds $3.2 billion, roughly, which is really about double what it was in Q1 of 2016. Obviously, we've got a major realization coming in Q2 with AdvancePierre. I can tell you that several of the groups are focused on realizations. Real estate, in particular, has done a great job of realizing that. But the big funds, Distressed Debt, really in Q1 accounted for about two-thirds of the realizations. And I expect that Distressed Debt will continue to a show favorable impressive realizations over the next nine months. To quantify it, it's just really, really hard, as I'm sure you can understand. I can just tell you that all the groups sort of see things the same way and sense that this is a great opportunity to realize are focused on harvesting. And I just think you'll see a continuation, particularly in the bigger groups, of good realizations. But I just couldn't quantify it. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective in terms of the first quarter.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities
It does. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you maybe just – I don't think this has come up in a while, but maybe just update us on your thoughts, from a strategic perspective, as it relates to Asia. I mean, obviously, U.S., Europe, you have Emerging Market franchise, you're building in different places. And many of your peers have been aggressively raising capital and expanding in Asia-specific strategies. And understanding maybe the legal system's not as conducive to some of what you do in much of Asia, but can you talk about your thoughts there and where that stands?
Bruce Karsh - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Thanks, Rob – thanks for the question, Robert. It's Bruce. I'll start and just say on the Opportunities Funds side, the Distressed Debt business. For the first time, about two years ago, we decided we would start to make a real push into Asia. We've been very happy. We've hired a couple key folks; one in Singapore, named Nick Weber; and one in Hong Kong, named Ray Chan. And they've hired some people under them, and we're building groups there. We sense there's going to be an opportunity in Asia on the Distressed Debt side over the next couple years, but we want to build our team, and walk before we run. And we did that very successfully in Europe, same strategy. And right now, in the Distressed Debt side, we have as many folks in London as we do in Los Angeles. So, I have high hopes for Asia. Pedro Urquidi is leading the build-out there on behalf of the team. And the only question is, will the opportunity materialize to the extent we think it will. And I'm optimistic.
There's a lot of debt that's built up in that part of the world. And the interesting thing is whether we'll feel the way we invest in a risk-controlled manner with creditor rights being respected will be the rule of the day over there. We also have an Emerging Markets Opportunities group, led by Julio Herrera, who currently is more focused on South America really and maybe Eastern Europe and less so in Asia. But I think at the right time that group probably will also start deploying resources over in Asia. So, interesting opportunity. Our antennae are way up. We're gearing up for what we think is going to be an outsized opportunity, an attractive one, and we'll wait to see.

Jay Steven Wintrob - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Yeah. If I could add to that, Bruce. I guess, as much of the investment opportunity in Asia is truly that, an opportunity, the fund-raising opportunity is here now. And if you look at Oaktree's results the last few years, Asia Pac has been our fastest-growing region in terms of fund-raising, but China, but also greater Asia. We've added resources in the region focused on fund-raising, and that includes Japan. And so, that's an active part of all of the fundraises I mentioned, a meaningful component of most of the fundraises I mentioned. And our expectations are, based on the amount of available assets in Asia and the relatively light amount that has been allocated to alternatives thus far, that that growth trajectory should continue. It won't be a straight line for us, but it should grow over time and probably faster than both the Americas and EMEA in terms of the growth rate.
Operator
And our next question is a follow-up from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks, guys. The accrued category bounce (44:25) had a really nice ramp over the next 12 months. I'm just wondering, what were the funds that really contributed to that? And sort of an alternate to an earlier question is, how should we think about the timing of the realization here, especially with your European waterfall?
Daniel Dane Levin - Oaktree Capital Management LP
So, thanks Craig. In terms of the kind of 30% growth, there's a couple of funds that have really contributed. First of all, Principal Fund IV has benefited from, first, the AdvancePierre IPO, and then as we mentioned now they announced sale of the business. So, that has resulted in a nice markup in net asset value. And that's the largest holding in the fund. As well, if you look in the fund table, Opportunities Fund VIII has had some nice returns over the last year and that fund has moved through the catch-up layer on a mark-to-market basis. And so, that's helped with the accrued incentives. In terms of the outlook, not sure how much more I can say than what we said in the second quarter, assuming AdvancePierre closes. As I kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect approximately $150 million net incentive income related to Principal Fund IV as that kind of reaches what we call crossover i.e., starts paying incentives and goes through the 80% layer.
As well, there is a couple other funds that I mentioned before, Real Estate Fund V and Power III, that are moving towards that point. And then the rest of the funds, as we continue to realize and distribute, will be making progress for kind of longer-term out. So, that's kind of how I think about our accrued incentives and how we're going to, over time, move that through the kind of income statement.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. Can I squeeze one more question in?
Daniel Dane Levin - Oaktree Capital Management LP
Sure.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
So, just on Opps Fund VIII, which had sort of a nice lift over last year, were there any themes or geographies or anything specific which should have drove the improvement there and drove it through (46:42) catch up?
Bruce Karsh - Oaktree Capital Group LLC
Our largest holding in Fund VIII is a public stock homebuilder, called Taylor Morrison, and homebuilding stocks last year languished. But as the year progressed and certainly the first quarter, that stock has improved materially, as has it's – it's business has been and continues to be very, very strong. Encourage you to take a look at the most recent quarterly report and outlook. And you'll see why we're optimistic about that particular holding. And I think it's the largest holding maybe by a factor of three almost in that fund.

Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. Thank you, Bruce.

OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — In his dystopian Inaugural Address, President Trump painted a picture of America as a nation gripped by vast “carnage” — a landscape of “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones” that cried out for a strongman to put “America first” and stop the world from stealing our jobs. It was a shocking speech in many ways and reportedly prompted former President George W. Bush to say to those around him on the dais, “That was some really weird [stuff].”It was weird, but was it all wrong?I just took a four-day car trip through the heart of that landscape — driving from Austin, Ind., down through Louisville, Ky., winding through Appalachia and ending up at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to try to answer that question.Trump is half right in his diagnosis, but his prescription is 100 percent wrong. We do have an epidemic of failing communities. But we also have a bounty of thriving ones — not because of a strongman in Washington but because of strong leaders at the local level.Indeed, this notion that America is a nation divided between two coasts that are supposedly thriving, pluralizing and globalizing and a vast flyover interior, where jobs have disappeared, drug addiction is rife and everyone is hoping Trump can bring back the 1950s, is highly inaccurate.

The big divide in America is not between the coasts and the interior. It’s between strong communities and weak communities. You can find weak ones along the coast and thriving ones in Appalachia, and vice versa. It’s community, stupid — not geography.The communities that are making it share a key attribute: They’ve created diverse adaptive coalitions, where local businesses get deeply involved in the school system, translating in real time the skills being demanded by the global economy.They also tap local colleges for talent and innovations that can diversify their economies and nurture unique local assets that won’t go away. Local foundations and civic groups step in to fund supplemental learning opportunities and internships, and local governments help to catalyze it all.

The success stories are all bottom-up; the failures are all where the bottom has fallen out.I started in one of the bottomless places: Austin, Ind., a tiny town of 4,000 off Interstate 65, which was described in a brilliant series in The Louisville Courier-Journal “as the epicenter of a medical disaster,” where citizens of all ages are getting hooked on liquefied painkillers and shooting up with dirty needles.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that Austin “contains the largest drug-fueled H.I.V. outbreak to hit rural America in recent history.” Its 5 percent infection rate “is comparable to some African nations.” Austin, the newspaper noted, doesn’t just sit at the intersection between Indianapolis and Louisville but at the “intersection of hopelessness and economic ruin.”

I chose to go there to meet the town’s only doctor, Will Cooke, whose heroic work I learned of from the Courier-Journal series. Cooke’s clinic, Foundations Family Medicine, sits at 25 West Main Street — opposite Marko’s Pizza & Sub, a liquor store and a drugstore. Down the street was a business combination I’d never seen before: Eagle’s Nest Tanning and Storage. It’s the Kissed by the Sun Tanning Salon and a warehouse — both of which seemed to be shuttered, with the space available for rent.For generations Austin’s economy was anchored by the Morgan Foods canning plant, but, as The Courier-Journal noted, “then came a series of economic blows familiar to many manufacturing-based communities. The American Can plant next to Morgan Foods shut its doors in 1986 after more than 50 years in business. A local supermarket closed. Workers left along with the jobs and poverty crept up among those who stayed.”Austin, Cooke explained to me, got caught in the vortex of declining blue-collar jobs, leading to a loss of dignity for breadwinners, depression and family breakdown, coinciding with doctors’ and drug companies’ pushing painkillers, and with too many people in the community failing to realize that to be in the middle class now required lifelong learning — not just to get a job but to hold one.“Thirty percent of students were not even graduating from high school,” said Cooke. “Then you take high unemployment, generational poverty, homelessness, childhood abuse and neglect, and cloak that within a closed-off culture inherited from Appalachia, and you begin to have the ingredients that contributed to the H.I.V. outbreak.”Austin’s insularity proved deadly for both jobs and families. “The close-knit, insular nature of the community worked against it, with the C.D.C. later finding up to six people shared needles at one sitting, and two or three generations — young adults, parents and grandparents — sometimes shot up together,” The Courier-Journal reported.Lately, though, Cooke told me, the town’s prospects have started to improve, precisely because the community has come together, not to shoot up but to start up and learn up and give a hand up. “The local high school has introduced college-credit classes and trade programs so people are graduating with a head start,” said Cooke. Faith-based and civic groups have mobilized, celebrating social and economic recovery, providing community dinners called “Food 4R Soul” and even installing community showers for people without running water.Addiction is often a byproduct of social breakdown leading to a sense of isolation. Cooke feels hopeful because he sees the tide slowly shifting as “social isolation gives way to community.”“Only a healthy individual can contribute to a healthy family, and only a healthy family can contribute to a healthy community — and all of that requires a foundation of trust,” said Cooke. “That kind of change can’t come from the outside, it has to be homegrown.”

I shared with him the business philosopher Dov Seidman’s admonition that “trust is the only legal performance-enhancing drug.” Dr. Cooke liked that a lot and only wished he could prescribe it as easily as others had prescribed opioids.But just 40 minutes down the highway from Austin, I interviewed Greg Fischer, the mayor of Louisville, a city bustling with energy and new buildings. “That ‘Intifada’ you wrote about in the Middle East is happening in parts of rural and urban America — people saying, ‘I feel disconnected and hopeless about participating in a rapidly changing global economy.’ Drug-related violence and addiction is one result — including in a few neighborhoods of Louisville.”But Louisville also has another story to tell: “We have 30,000 job openings,” said Fischer, and for the best of reasons: Louisville has “a vision for how a city can be a platform for human potential to flourish.” It combines “strategies of the heart,” like asking everyone to regularly give a day of service to the city; strategies of science, like “citizen scientists” bearing GPS-enabled inhalers that the city uses to track air pollution, mitigate it and warn asthma suffers; and strategies for job creation that leverage Louisville’s unique assets.One job-creation strategy led to a slew of new businesses that make “end of runway” products for rapid delivery by leveraging the fact that Louisville is UPS’s worldwide air hub; “bourbon tourism” that leverages the fact that Kentucky is the Napa Valley of bourbon; a partnership with Lexington, home of the University of Kentucky, has created an advanced manufacturing corridor; and by leveraging Humana’s headquarters in Louisville, the city has unleashed a lifelong wellness and aging-care industry.Show me a community that understands today’s world and is working together to thrive within it, and I’ll show you a community on the rise — coastal or interior, urban or rural.I found more such communities as I moved south on Interstate 75 through Tennessee to Oak Ridge, home of the Manhattan Project facilities where the enriched uranium for the “Little Boy” atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was produced.Today, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which sprawls across two counties, is still involved with nuclear weaponry, but its supercomputer, one of the world’s most powerful, and its hundreds of scientists help drive a broad array of research in energy, materials science, 3-D manufacturing, robotics, physics, cybersecurity and nuclear medicine — research it now actively shares with the surrounding Appalachian communities to spawn new industries and jobs.Sitting on the spot where the K-25 Manhattan Project facility once stood, I interviewed Ron Woody, county executive for Roane County, where Oak Ridge is partly located, and Steve Jones, an industrial recruiter hired by the city of Oak Ridge to seek out companies interested in investing in the region or leveraging spinouts from Oak Ridge’s labs. That kind of active entrepreneurship is a new thing for Roane County, where generations of people have known only a government job.

“Back in the 1980s you had the T.V.A. [Tennessee Valley Authority], and it had over 50,000 employees. Now it has 10,000 employees,” explained Woody, so “we were not diversified in our employment. We had to convince the public that we can’t rely on the Oak Ridge lab and T.V.A. The Cold War is over. So our communities had to make a big transition from a lot of government programs to very few.”It’s starting to work, said Woody, “but progress is slow.” One of those success stories was luring a former three-time Tour de France winner, Greg LeMond, to open a 65,000-square-foot factory for his new company, LeMond Composites, for making lightweight carbon-fiber bikes, based on new materials pioneered at Oak Ridge.“The research Oak Ridge has done is going to change the way we make things,” LeMond explained to me, as we sat in his new factory. “It is a really exciting future. My goal is that you will be able to go on my website and design your own bike out of carbon fiber.”But just because there are workers looking for employment and there are new jobs opening, it isn’t automatic that local people work in those jobs, explained Jones, the recruiter. Because of the opioid crisis, many people cannot pass the mandatory drug test — and years of working for the government has left them unprepared for the pace of today’s private sector.“The two biggest issues we are dealing with are the soft skills and passing the drug test,” explained Woody. “I thought the problem was that people needed more STEM skills.” But that’s not the case.It turns out that it’s not that hard to train someone, even with just a high school or community college degree, to operate an advanced machine tool or basic computer. “Factory managers would say, ‘I will train them and put them to work tomorrow in good jobs” requiring hard skills, said Woody. “The problem they have is finding people with the right soft skills.”What are those soft skills? I asked. “Employers just want someone who will get up, dress up, show up, shut up and never give up,” Woody responded without hesitation. And there are fewer workers with those soft skills than you might think, he added.When new companies come into the area today, noted Jones, who grew up on a farm, they ask specifically for young people who were either in a 4-H club or Future Farmers of America (now called FFA) because kids with a farming background are much more likely to get up, dress up, show up on time and never give up in a new job.

Soft skills also include the willingness to be a lifelong learner, because jobs are changing so quickly. For instance, the Oak Ridge lab is partnering to embed top-level local technical talent as entrepreneurial research fellows in advanced manufacturing who want to start companies in this realm. Every summer Oak Ridge’s M.D.F. — Manufacturing Demonstration Facility — hosts 100 young interns to learn the latest in 3-D printing, and its experts coach teams from local high schools for national robotics competitions.The beauty of 3-D printers is that any community can now go into the manufacturing business, explained Lonnie Love, a corporate fellow at Oak Ridge, as he showed me around the M.D.F., where whole car bodies and car parts are being “printed” on giant 3-D printers.“Traditionally to make a car part you first had to build a die, and those dies cost anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million to make,” Love said. Every die consists of a female and a male die, and the way you made a car part was to stamp them together. There are hundreds of dies needed to make a car, and that was why an assembly line for a new car model in Detroit could cost upward of $200 million — and take two years to build. Sadly, that die-making industry actually moved out of America to Asia over the last 15 years, leaving only a dozen such companies in the U.S.No more. “Large-scale 3-D printing is enabling us to re-shore that industry,” explained Love, who then offered this example: “The naval air station at Cherry Point, N.C., repairs all the aircraft for the Navy on the East Coast. About a year ago their head of engineering called me on a Monday and asked if we could print a die mold for them and I said, ‘Sure, just send me the digital model of what you want printed.’“We got it by email that afternoon, and by Friday he had the mold to make the new part. And it only weighed about 40 pounds because with 3-D printing we could make it stronger but lighter weight by hollowing out the inside. The following Monday he calls and asks me how much did it cost and how long did it take me to make? I told him it took me longer — and was more expensive — to ship it to him than it was make it.”Think about car dealers in the future who, instead of needing a huge lot with hundreds of cars in inventory, will just custom print the car you want. “Our only inventory is carbon fiber pellets that cost $2 a pound, and we can make any product out of them,” said Love. “You won’t need inventory anymore.”Over the last 100 years, Love concluded, we went from decentralized artisan-based manufacturing to centralized mass manufacturing on assembly lines. Today, with these emerging technologies, we can go back to artisans, which will be great for local communities that spawn a leadership and workers able to take advantage of these emerging technologies. We are going to see a world of micro-factories, and you can see them sprouting around Oak Ridge already.“There’s a new wave of kids coming up who love this stuff,” said Love. “We can create mini-moonshots all over the place.”

The same applies to the design of the parts. Thom Mason, the director of the Oak Ridge lab, explained to me that high-performance computing “allows you to design and test out all the parts on the computer and only make those that you know will work. It is totally speeding up the iteration loop of physical manufacturing. You move all the trial and failure into the digital world — so you don’t need to do all that costly tooling of prototypes — and then go straight to manufacturing.”But the state of Tennessee has also had its thinking cap on about the fast world. In 2014 it decided to make tuition and fees free for high school graduates who want to enroll in any state community college or technical school — on the condition that they maintain at least a C- average, stay in school for consecutive semesters, contribute eight hours of community service each semester and meet with a volunteer coach/mentor who will help them stay on track to get their degree. Starting in 2018, Tennessee adults who don’t already have a two-year degree will be able to go to any state community college and earn one free as well.I ended my little tour in Knoxville, Tenn., where I met with the mayor at a restaurant in the newly rejuvenated downtown square, a beehive of restaurants, public art exhibitions, theaters, shopping and museums.“Until the mid-1980s, the old economic development model here was low wages and no unions. That model wasn’t sustainable,” said Mayor Madeline Rogero, the first woman mayor of Knoxville and a former organizer for Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers union. “We wanted better schools, and you cannot build a great school system on the back of low-wage workers. So we started thinking about what are our unique assets and stopped selling ourselves as a low-wage town.”The whole region came together around that project and wove an adaptive coalition that could draw in investors based on the region’s strengths. It’s call Innovation Valley, the mayor explained, and it markets the assets of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pellissippi State and Roane State Community Colleges, the work force skills in the metro area and available infrastructure that can be utilized by technology companies. It also stimulated a dialogue between employers and higher-learning institutions to ensure they’re meeting the labor force needs of the future.But there are real constraints that need to be overcome. The region has a shortage of both manufacturing and back-office workers. “We face the same work force development issues that all metro areas in the U.S. are facing,” explained Bryan Daniels, president of the Blount Partnership, one of Knoxville’s regional development boards. “Our local law enforcement has described the prison populations as having approximately 65 percent opioid-related inmates.”It is vital, therefore, for the community to develop programs to get this population back to being employable. At the same time, said Daniels, the Knoxville region is exploring new ways to get workers from outlying rural areas into the metro area labor force and help them acquire the “educational attainment they need to get their skill level up” for a modern economy. They are even studying “public-private partnerships to provide transportation for [rural] workers up to a two-hour commute radius,” he said.This is the real picture of America today.It’s cities and regions rising together to leverage their unique assets from the bottom up — living side by side with distressed and lost communities where the bottom has fallen out. It’s not your grandparents’ America, but it is also not Trump’s America — that land of vast carnage and an industrial wasteland. The picture is much more complex.

It’s actually Bill Clinton’s America.Clinton once famously observed, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right in America.” That has never been more accurate — and necessary — than it is today.

What is wrong with America is that too many communities, rural and urban, have broken down. What is right with America is the many communities and regions that are coming together to help their citizens acquire the skills and opportunities to own their own futures. We need to share and scale these success stories.Only strong communities, not a strong man, will make America great again.
