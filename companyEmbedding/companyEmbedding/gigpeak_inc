(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2016. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or such risk factors.  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein by reference include forward-looking statements within the meaning and protections of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are also made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions, and future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control, and which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Overview  GigPeak, Inc. is a leading innovator of semiconductor integrated circuits ("ICs") and software solutions for high-speed connectivity and high-quality video compression over the network and the Cloud. Our focus is to develop and deliver products that enable lower power consumption and faster data connectivity, more efficient use of network infrastructure and broader connectivity to the Cloud, and reduce the total cost of ownership of existing network pipes from the core to the end user. GigPeak addresses both the speed of data transmission and the amount of bandwidth the data consumes within the network, and provides solutions that increase the efficiency of various cloud-connected applications such as the Internet-of-Things ("IoT"), leveraging our strength in high-speed connectivity and, with the highest quality video compression assets that were acquired through the acquisition the ("Merger") of Magnum Semiconductor, Inc. ("Magnum") during our second fiscal quarter on April 5, 2016. The extended product portfolio provides more flexibility to support changing market requirements and customer's dynamic road-maps, by way of using ICs and monolithic microwave integrated circuits ("MMICs"), and through full software programmability and cost efficient custom application specific integrated circuit ("ASICs").  We develop semiconductor ICs and software solutions for high-speed connectivity and high-quality video compression over the enterprise network and the Cloud. With our product focus, we attempt to reduce the total cost of ownership of existing network pipes, from the core of the network to the end user appliances and terminals.  GigPeak addresses both the speed of data transmission and the amount of bandwidth the data consumes within the network, which are the two major data streaming bottlenecks, while also the future enabler factors, to maintain network efficiency. As such, GigPeak's products also naturally provide solutions that increase the efficiency of IoT and other Cloud-connected applications. GigPeak's solutions leverage our industry-recognized strength in high-speed connectivity delivered through the GigOptix brand-name product line, and as of the second fiscal quarter of 2016, the highest quality video compression delivered through the industry-recognized Magnum brand.  The recently extended GigPeak product portfolio provides flexibility to better support on-going changes in the connectivity that customers and markets require by deploying a wide tool-box of solutions from various kinds of semiconductor materials, integrated circuits and Multi-Chip-Modules ("MCMs), through cost-effective ASICs and system-on-chips ("SoCs"), and into full software programmable open-platform offerings.  Our products are highly customized and typically developed in partnership with key "Lighthouse" customers, occasionally generating some engineering project revenues through the development stage, and where the largest revenue is generated from future device product shipments and sales through these customers and general market availability.  Since inception in 2007, we have expanded our customer base by acquiring and integrating eight (8) companies with complementary and synergistic products and customers, and spun out one (1) business to establish a joint-venture. Our worldwide direct sales force is supported by a significant number of channel representatives and distributors that sell our products throughout North America, South America, Europe, Japan and Asia.  As noted above, on April 5, 2016, we completed our most recent acquisition of Magnum, and simultaneously renamed ourselves as GigPeak, Inc. Magnum is a fabless semiconductor manufacturer and brings a well-developed and comprehensive portfolio of video broadcasting and compression solutions to GigPeak, including silicon ICs, SoCs, software solutions, and a comprehensive library of intellectual property. The Magnum products currently are for the professional video broadcast and are extendable to IoT camera markets. Magnum provides top of the line products, tools and technologies for the entire video content creation and distribution chain, from contribution and production through distribution over cable, telecom, satellite and over-the-top ("OTT") video streaming.  Table of Contents  The blending of products and technologies gives GigPeak the capability to address both the speed of data transmission and the amount of bandwidth the data consumes within a network, driven in particular by the video content which is the source of a majority of the datacenter traffic and storage on today's networks. Through this combination, we provide solutions to enhance the footprint utilization and reduce total cost of ownership of existing network pipes from the core to the end user. Our wide product portfolio and exceptional customer support practices, will continue to serve the enterprise networking and broadcasting original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), as well as IoT and other Cloud-connected consumers.  With the acquisition of Magnum we are in the process of reorganizing our operations to line up with our targeted end-markets and customers. This will eventually result later in fiscal 2016 in two business lines: the Enterprise Networking, which will be likely named the "GigOptix" product line, and the Consumer and Cloud-Connectivity, which will be likely named the "GigCloud" line. Most of our current product lines will contribute products to each one of those two business lines.  GigPeak's Solutions  With the acquisition of Magnum, in addition to those solutions that we offer as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have added the following additional solutions.  Broadcasting Solutions  With the acquisition of Magnum, we are now a provider of silicon, modules, software and IP for the professional broadcast infrastructure market. We provide top of the line products, tools and technologies for the entire video content creation and distribution chain, from contribution and production through distribution over cable, satellite and OTT video streaming.  Video Contribution: We were the first to market with a single chip to address all market needs, from legacy MPEG-2 4:2:0/4:2:2 8-bit to H.264 4:2:0/4:2:2 10-bit to AVC-I 50 and AVC-I 100 encoding and decoding applications. With over a decade of video quality leadership and technology innovation behind it, our D7Pro offers advanced encoding and decoding solution for video contribution and news gathering. In addition, the D7Pro offers a complete video-audio-ancillary data-mux integrated solution enabling high video quality, low latency at low bit rates for video encoding and decoding.  Video Production: As the market leader in professional video processing silicon and software, we offer system vendors the market's most advanced solutions for baseband video, audio and data processing. We enable a single design solution for all products within a production domain - routers, channel branding, video filtering, chroma/luma leveling, audio leveling and down mixing, format conversion, rescaling, low latency switching and more. Our solution is a dual channel 4:2:2 10-bit native solution with embedded memory and support for various I/O interfaces from storage, networking and PCIe to 1080p baseband video.  Primary Video Distribution: Content originators are rapidly adopting advanced technologies such as H.264 and efficient statistical multiplexing systems as well as considering migration to H.265 compression for higher compression efficiency while continuing to support legacy MPEG-2 formats. Vendors of encoding, decoding and transcoding equipment for primary distribution must quickly bring to market solutions that support high video quality H.264 SD/HD, H.265 SD/HD as well as MPEG-2 SD/HD. Ideally, to minimize operator operating expense, these systems should enable both types of services to be aggregated in single bundle without compromising video quality.  Consumer and Cloud Connectivity - Video Solutions  To address both Cloud, and current and future consumer connected devices as well as IoTs, we plan to use our stand-alone proprietary RF mixed signal technology, ASICs and, with the acquisition of Magnum, video ICs, SoCs and software IP for various high volume applications such as Ultra-Wide Bandwidth TX/RX ICs, video and camera chips, etc. We already possess extensive experience with Ultra High-Speed Interfaces and now has the capability of adding Digital Signal Processing and video capabilities to address sophisticated IoT applications. Ultimately we intend to expand its reach into the consumer IoT market where its ICs, SoCs and software IP provide unique stand-alone and integrated solutions to various wearable gadgets, high speed and lower power interface ICs to end user products, ICs for motion detection cameras and other special camera and video applications.  Table of Contents  Our solutions offer complete multi-format feature rich solutions with high-quality H.265/H.264/MPEG-2 CBR/VBR encoding; advanced, high density any-format-to-any-format transcoding; the ability to manipulate video content for multi-screen applications; support for digital program insertion; and comprehensive support for audio-ancillary data-mux system level features.  Products  Enterprise Networking: Telecom, Datacom and Broadcasting  We design and market products that amplify electrical signals during both the transmission (amplifiers, laser devices and modulator drivers, and clock-data-recovery devices) and reception (TIAs) of optical signals in the transmission of data. In addition, our microwave and millimeter wave amplifiers amplify small signal radio signals into more powerful signals that can be transmitted over long distances to establish high throughput data connections or enable radar based applications. We have a comprehensive product portfolio, particularly at data rates that exceed 40 Gbps. The primary target markets and applications for our products include optical interface modules such as line-cards, transponders and transceivers within telecom and datacom switches and routers, high speed wireless point-to-point millimeter wave systems and defense systems. Our products are critical blocks used in telecom and datacom optical communications networks. For telecom, these networks range from long haul to metro systems, and for datacom, from access to data links to the consumers, where the conversion of data from the electrical domain to the optical domain, or vice-versa occurs. Our optical drivers amplify the input digital data stream that is used to directly modulate the laser or to drive an external modulator that acts as a precise shutter to switch on and off the light that creates the optical data stream. At the other end of the optical fiber, our sensitive receiver TIAs detect and amplify the small currents generated by photo-diodes converting the received light into an electrical current. The TIAs amplify the small current signals into a larger voltage signal that can be read by the electronics and processors in the network servers. We supply an optimized component for each type of laser and photo-diode depending upon the speed, reach and required cost. Generally, a shorter reach results in higher volume, less demanding product specifications and greater pressure to reduce costs.  With the acquisition of Magnum, we now also offer enterprise video system vendors the market's foremost advanced enterprise video broadcasting solutions. Our silicon and software are all-complete system solutions with rich features including high video quality SD/HD H.265, H.264, MPEG-2, VBR/CBR, video statistical multiplexing, digital ad-insertion, low latency encoding and complete video, audio and data multiplexing. We implement our products in a number of process technologies and have been at the forefront of extracting optimal performance from each technology to be able to address each market segment's individual requirements in a cost effective manner. In some instances, we provide NRE design services for certain custom designs of our high-speed communications components in order to enhance our commercial partnerships with these customers. The NRE work is included in development fees and other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations.  Consumer and Cloud-Computing-Connectivity  Our semiconductor ICs, SoCs and software solutions are designed to address the challenges faced by network operators for high-speed connectivity and high-quality video compression over the enterprise network and the Cloud. Our focus is to deliver products that enable lower power consumption and faster data connectivity, more efficient use of network infrastructure, broader connectivity to the Cloud, all in attempt to reduce the total cost of ownership of existing network pipes, from the core of the network to the end user appliances and terminals. Our products, which are in use by various end user and corporate customers, such as top video delivery vendors, naturally provide solutions that increase the efficiency of the networks to which they are deployed, delivering data to IoT and other Cloud connected applications.  In addition to ICs and SoCs, we also with the acquisition of Magnum provides our video equipment vendor customers with system software that allows for rapid product development and support of various capabilities necessary in the professional broadcast and OTT video distribution environments. These system software capabilities include video statistical multiplexing, de-interlacing, advertisement insertion, video overlay insertion and various ancillary data insertion and multiplexing capabilities.  Furthermore, we also offer a software-only compression solution for professional broadcast market systems running on Intel CPUs and standard data center servers. We offer our customers the flexibility to choose either our proprietary ASIC-based solution running our software or an Intel-based platform running our software.  In addition, we offer complex ASIC solutions and design work that are used in a number of applications such as defense, test and measurement applications and emerging consumer electronics such as gaming and entertainment, to enable the high speed processing of complex signals.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations Revenue Revenue for the periods reported was as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 27, 2016 March 29, 2015 Product $ 10,489 $ 8,561 Development fees and other 873 499 Total revenue $ 11,362 $ 9,060 Increase period over period $ 2,302 Percentage increase, period over period 25 %  Total revenue for the three months ended March 27, 2016 was $11.4 million, an increase of $2.3 million or 25%, compared with $9.1 million for the three months ended March 29, 2015. For the three months ended March 27, 2016, 92% of our revenue was contributed by product revenue and 8% of our revenue was contributed by development fees and other revenue. For the three months ended March 29, 2015, 94% of our revenue was contributed by product revenue and 6% of our revenue was contributed by development fees and other revenue.  Product revenue for the three months ended March 27, 2016 was $10.5 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 23%, compared with $8.6 million for the three months ended March 29, 2015. The increase in product revenue during the three months ended March 27, 2016 was primarily due to an overall increase in demand for our products.  Development fees and other revenue for the three months ended March 27, 2016 was $873,000, an increase of $374,000 or 75%, compared with $499,000 for the three months ended March 29, 2015. We experienced an increase in development fees and other revenue due to an increase in the number and size of development projects.  Table of Contents  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit Cost of revenue and gross profit for the periods presented was as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 27, 2016 March 29, 2015 Total cost of revenue $ 3,683 $ 3,667 Gross profit $ 7,679 $ 5,393 Gross margin 68 % 60 % Increase, period over period 2,286 Percentage increase, period over period 42 %  Gross profit consists of revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs to manufacture saleable chips, including outsourced wafer fabrication and testing; costs of direct materials; equipment depreciation; costs associated with procurement, production control and quality assurance; fees paid to our offshore manufacturing vendors; reserves for potential excess or obsolete material; costs related to stock-based compensation; accrued costs associated with potential warranty returns; and amortization of certain identified intangible assets. Amortization expense of identified intangible assets, namely existing technology, is presented within cost of revenue, as the intangible assets were determined to be directly attributable to revenue generating activities.  Gross profit for the three months ended March 27, 2016 was $7.7 million, or a gross margin of 68%, compared to a gross profit of $5.4 million, or a gross margin of 60%, for the three months ended March 29, 2015. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to a change in product mix.  We record revenue from non-recurring engineering projects associated with product development that we enter into with certain customers. In general, these projects are associated with complex technology development, and as such we do not have certainty about our ability to achieve the program milestones. Achievement of the milestone is typically dependent on our performance and acceptance by the customer. The payment associated with achieving the milestone is generally commensurate with our effort or the value of the deliverable and is nonrefundable. Therefore, we record the expenses related to these projects in the periods incurred and recognize revenue only when we have earned the revenue and achieved the development milestones. Revenue from these projects is typically recorded at 100% gross margin because the costs associated with these projects are expensed as incurred and generally included in research and development expense. These efforts generally benefit our overall product development programs beyond the specific project requested by our customer.  Development project revenue and other non-product revenue for the three months ended March 27, 2016 was $873,000 compared with $499,000 for the three months ended March 29, 2015. Excluding the revenue and gross profit associated with development programs and other non-product revenue, gross margin was 65% and 57% for the three months ended March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015, respectively.   Research and Development Expense Research and development expense for the periods presented was as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 27, 2016 March 29, 2015 Research and development expense $ 3,525 $ 3,248 Percentage of revenue 31 % 36 % Increase, period over period $ 277 Percentage increase, period over period 9 %  Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for research and development personnel, consulting and engineering design, non-capitalized tools and equipment, engineering related semiconductor masks, depreciation for equipment, engineering expenses paid to outside technology development suppliers, allocated facilities costs and expenses related to stock-based compensation.  Research and development expense for the three months ended March 27, 2016 was $3.5 million compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended March 29, 2015, an increase of $277,000 or 9%. Research and development costs increased as compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to a $97,000 increase in expense related to amortization on GigOptix-Terasquare-Korea Co., Ltd.'s ("GTK") intangible asset, a $95,000 increase for project-related materials and a $76,000 increase in stock-based compensation expense.

Company Update (NASDAQ:IDTI): Integrated Device Technology Inc to Acquire GigPeak for $3.08 per Share
 
 Corey Williams-February 14, 2017, 9:45 AM EDT

SHARE ON:





 


 


Integrated Device Technology Inc (NASDAQ:IDTI) and GigPeak, Inc. (NYSE:GIG) announced that they have signed a definitive agreement for IDT to acquire GigPeak, Inc., for total cash consideration of $3.08 per share, or approximately $250 million in cash. This per share consideration would represent a premium of approximately 22% to GigPeak’s closing share price on February 10, 2017.
The acquisition of GigPeak provides IDT with a highly regarded optical interconnect product and technology business that is complementary to IDT’s leadership position in real-time interconnect products.
GigPeak’s optical interface products are already broadly used by leading companies in the Communications, Cloud Data Center, and Military/Aviation markets. IDT will now provide seamless ultra-high speed data connectivity products using electrical, RF, and optical technologies.
“GigPeak is a recognized leader in high performance Optical, RF, and Video Transport technology, and is a perfect fit for IDT. The products, technology, and culture of GigPeak all complement and represent an acceleration of our current strategy,” said Gregory Waters, IDT President & CEO. “We gain an exceptional group of talented people and valuable intellectual property with the GigPeak team, and welcome them into one of the most innovative companies in the semiconductor industry.”
“IDT’s acquisition of GigPeak will be a meaningful milestone for all of our stakeholders — stockholders, employees, customers and partners,” said Dr. Avi Katz, Founder, Chairman and CEO of GigPeak, Inc. “We find an exceptional culture, customers, business and technology compatibility with IDT, and we are delighted to join this fine team. Upon the consummation of this acquisition, our leading product suite, which currently addresses the need for greater bandwidth across the network, will now have the advantage of leveraging the scale of resources and broad distribution channels of IDT.”
Offer Recommended by GigPeak Board of Directors
Under the terms of the merger agreement, IDT will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of GigPeak for $3.08 per share. The implied fully-diluted equity value of the offer amounts to approximately $250 million.
The Boards of Directors of both GigPeak and IDT have unanimously approved the terms of the merger agreement, and the Board of Directors of GigPeak has resolved to recommend that stockholders accept the offer, once it is commenced.
The acquisition is structured as an all-cash tender offer for all outstanding issued common stock of GigPeak followed by a merger in which remaining shares of GigPeak would be converted into the same dollar per share consideration as in the tender offer. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition, and completion is anticipated during the second calendar quarter of 2017.
The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the tender of the majority of the outstanding GigPeak shares and the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is expected to close during the second calendar quarter of 2017. GigPeak is expected to be delisted from the NYSE MKT and integrated into IDT thereafter.
Shares of Integrated Device Technology are currently trading at $24.61, down $0.12 or -0.49%. IDTI has a 1-year high of $26.66 and a 1-year low of $17.25. The stock’s 50-day moving average is $24.90 and its 200-day moving average is $22.59.
On the ratings front, IDTI has been the subject of a number of recent research reports. In a report issued on February 8, Roth Capital analyst Sujeeva De Silva reiterated a Buy rating on IDTI, with a price target of $28, which represents a potential upside of 13% from where the stock is currently trading. On the same day, Needham’s Quinn Bolton reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and has a price target of $28.
According to TipRanks.com, which ranks over 7,500 financial analysts and bloggers to gauge the performance of their past recommendations, Sujeeva De Silva and Quinn Bolton have a yearly average return of 21.0% and 20.4% respectively. Silva has a success rate of 65% and is ranked #83 out of 4428 analysts, while Bolton has a success rate of 72% and is ranked #25.
Overall, one research analyst has rated the stock with a Sell rating, 4 research analysts have given a Buy rating to the stock. When considering if perhaps the stock is under or overvalued, the average price target is $27.00 which is 9.2% above where the stock opened today.
Integrated Device Technology, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets low-power, high-performance mixed signal semiconductor solutions for the advanced communications, computing and consumer industries. It offers communications solutions for customers within the enterprise, data center and wireless markets. The company operates business through two segments: Communications and Computing & Consumer.

 February 13, 2017NYSE MKT: GIG  GigPeak Q4 FY16 Corporate Summary 


 










 Additional Information and Where to Find It:This presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. The tender offer for the outstanding shares of GigPeak’s common stock described in the separate GigPeak press releases has not commenced. At the time the tender offer is commenced, IDT will file or cause to be filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC and GigPeak will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC related to the tender offer. The Tender Offer Statement (including an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal and other tender offer documents) and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement will contain important information that should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. Those materials will be made available to GigPeak’s stockholders at no expense to them by the information agent to the tender offer, which will be announced. In addition, all of those materials (and any other documents filed with the SEC) will be available at no charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.Forward Looking Statements: This presentation contains statements regarding the anticipated consummation of the acquisition of GigPeak and the timing and benefits thereof, operating trends; expected future results and guidance; GigPeak’s and its subsidiaries’ expansion and business strategies into new markets and projects; anticipated growth opportunities; changes in business or other market conditions and product trends that are forward-looking. We undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and in other sections of the GigPeak filings with the SEC, and in GigPeak’s other current and periodic reports filed or furnished from time to time with the SEC.   Disclaimer  2 


 










 Use of Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA Financial Measures:These materials include references to non-GAAP net income/loss, adjusted consolidated non-GAAP net income/loss, and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest, taxes, other expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, acquisition and strategic activities related costs and loss on equity method investment. Adjusted EBITDA differs from net earnings, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that it excludes the foregoing items. GigPeak believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of the ongoing operations of its business, provide an additional metric for comparability between reporting periods, and provide an additional baseline for analyzing trends in GigPeak’s operations. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used in determining compliance with covenants in our term loan and revolving line agreement. GigPeak does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. GigPeak believes the disclosure of the effects of these items increases the reader’s understanding of, and an enhanced level of transparency into, the underlying performance of the business and that such non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures provide investors with a supplemental tool to evaluate our financial results and assess our prospects for future performance.Intellectual Property:All trademarks, service marks and trade names of GigPeak, Inc. used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of GigPeak, Inc.
