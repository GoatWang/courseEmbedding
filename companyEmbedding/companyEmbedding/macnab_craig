ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- National Retail Properties, Inc. (NYSE:    NNN) (the "Company") today announced that Craig Macnab, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, will retire as CEO and step down as Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors effective April 28, 2017. Julian E. ("Jay") Whitehurst, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of President and CEO as of April 28, 2017.










 







							 		Jay Whitehurst, National Retail Properties
							  



 

 
 



Mr. Macnab has been the Company's Chief Executive Officer since February 2004, and the Chairman of its Board of Directors since February 2008. 
Mr. Macnab commented: "National Retail Properties has a compelling business model, a great retail real estate portfolio that is conservatively financed, a wonderful culture and an exceptional team.  Jay is the right person to succeed me and I look forward to watching Jay and his colleagues take NNN to the next level." 
As a part of the Board's succession planning activities and upon Mr. Macnab's recommendation, the Company's Board of Directors has unanimously appointed Mr. Whitehurst President and CEO effective April 28, 2017.  Mr. Whitehurst joined the Company in February 2003, was appointed Chief Operating Officer in June 2004 and has served as President since May 2006.
Mr. Whitehurst commented, "I want to thank Craig and our Board of Directors for the opportunity to serve as the next CEO of National Retail Properties upon Craig's retirement.  We will certainly miss Craig when he steps down next spring, but our experienced management team and talented associates will continue his mission to deliver outstanding results and create shareholder value."
The Board has appointed Robert Legler, the Board's lead independent Director, as Chairman of the Board effective upon Mr. Macnab's retirement.  Said Mr. Legler, "On behalf of National Retail Properties' entire Board of Directors, I would like to recognize Craig's exceptional leadership. He has been seen as a leader among his peers in the REIT industry for many years, and the Company's operating performance has benefited from his guidance and execution. During Craig's tenure, total assets have grown from $1.2 billion to more than $6 billion and most importantly the Company has produced average annual total shareholder returns over 14%.  Strong leaders require strong successors, and consummating our thorough executive succession plan, the Board is pleased to appoint Jay Whitehurst to the role of President and CEO.  Jay's experience and talents equip him well for the opportunities ahead, and we are confident that he will build upon the solid foundation that Craig has established." 
National Retail Properties invests primarily in high-quality retail properties subject generally to long-term, net leases.  As of June 30, 2016, the company owned 2,452 properties in 48 states with a gross leasable area of approximately 26.3 million square feet with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 years.  
Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical are "forward-looking" statements. These statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "may," "estimated," or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause the company's actual future results to differ materially from expected results. These risks include, among others, general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, changes in interest rates, increases in operating costs, the preferences and financial condition of the company's tenants, the availability of capital, risks related to the company's status as a REIT and the profitability of the company's taxable subsidiary. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings, including, but not limited to, the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the company or the SEC. Such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company's current operating plans and estimates. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. National Retail Properties, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made.

Stocks brace for volatility in earnings deluge; Fed meeting looms

How to Fix Wall Street, and Bankers' Pay

Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history
              
              One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

U.S. to drop charges against ex-J.P. Morgan traders in London Whale case
              
              The U.S. government on Friday dropped charges against two former derivatives traders at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. --Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Groupt--in the London Whale case, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The U.S. decided not to pursue the charges after it determined that it can no longer rely on the testimony of Bruno Iksil, a former colleague of the defendants. Iksil was one of the several at J.P. Morgan that were involved in a trading debacle that resulted in over $6 billion in losses for the bank. London Whale was a nickname given to Iksil by his competitors.

U.S. stocks close lower as shaky GE outlook ends week
              
              U.S. stocks closed lower Friday, with the Dow industrials finishing lower for the week, as General Electric Co.'s  outlook cast a cloud over earnings season, which is just getting started. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 31.71 points, or 0.2%, to close at 21,580.07, with shares of GE falling 2.9% and shares of Chevron Corp.  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  helping to lead blue chips lower. For the week, the Dow finished 0.3% lower, snapping a two-week win streak. The S&P 500 index  declined 0.91 point to close at 2,472.54, with five out of 11 sectors finishing lower, led by declines in energy and industrials. The index logged a 0.5% gain for the week, for a third week of gains. The Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 2.25 points at 6,387.75. The tech-heavy index finished up 1.2% for the week for a third week of gains.

CLEVELAND, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Forest City Realty Trust, Inc., (NYSE:   FCEA and FCEB) today announced the appointment of Z. Jamie Behar, CFA, and the nomination of Craig Macnab, two highly qualified and accomplished real estate executives with significant board experience, to serve on its Board of Directors. 








Behar will join the Board effective immediately and will fill the vacancy created when Bruce C. Ratner, executive chairman of Forest City's New York subsidiary, stepped down from the Board at the end of 2016. The Board has nominated Macnab as an independent director to succeed Stan Ross, who will not stand for re-election at the Company's upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Behar brings to the Board more than 35 years of experience in investment management and financial analysis with a focus on real estate, together with significant experience serving on boards. Behar is the former Managing Director, Real Estate & Alternative Investments, at GM Investment Management Corp, where she was responsible for managing real estate and alternative investment portfolios totaling approximately $12 billion at peak value. 
Macnab is a seasoned executive with more than 35 years of experience in the real estate industry and investment banking and management. Macnab has served as chief executive officer of National Retail Properties, a publicly traded REIT with a market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, since 2004, and the chairman of its Board of Directors since 2008. He will retire from his roles at National Retail Properties, effective April 28, 2017.
"We are thrilled to welcome these two outstanding real estate professionals to our board and we look forward to benefiting from their significant industry experience," said James A. Ratner, chairman of the Board. "In addition to their deep knowledge of our industry and impressive board-service credentials, the appointment of Jamie Behar and the nomination of Craig Macnab reflect our ongoing commitment to best practices in corporate governance and increased board independence."
"As a management team, we look forward to capitalizing on the fresh insights and viewpoints these new directors are expected to bring to the Board as we continue to execute on our strategy to ensure long-term growth at Forest City," said David J. LaRue, president and chief executive officer. "Both Jamie and Craig have unique perspectives on the real estate business and a wealth of experience in organizational and investment strategy, as well as outstanding leadership skills, and will provide Forest City with additional perspectives for enhancing shareholder value."
Both Behar and Macnab, along with the Company's other directors, will stand for election at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Behar and Macnab were identified through the Board's previously announced search process, which it conducted with the assistance of nationally recognized search firm Ferguson Partners, Ltd. With these board actions and anticipated director elections, the Forest City Board will be comprised of thirteen directors, eight of whom are independent, one of whom is the President and Chief Executive Officer, and four of whom are members of the founding family, the Company's largest non-institutional shareholder.
About Jamie BeharJamie Behar, 59, most recently served as Managing Director, Real Estate & Alternative Investments at GM Investment Management Corp ("GMIMCo"). In her role at GMIMCo, Behar managed clients' private market and publicly traded real estate and alternative investment portfolios totaling approximately $12 billion at peak value. Behar was a member of GMIMCo's Board of Directors, Investment Management Committee, Private Equity Investment Approval Committee and Risk Management Committee. Behar has served as a Board member of Gramercy Property Trust since 2015, where she is a member of the Investment Committee and Audit Committee, and as a director of Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. since 2004 and chairs the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and serves on the Audit Committee. She was previously Board Chair of the Pension Real Estate Association and was a member of the Real Estate Investment Advisory Council of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). 
Behar holds a bachelor's of science degree in economics from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, an MBA from Columbia University Graduate School of Business, and is a Chartered Financial Analyst.
About Craig MacnabCraig Macnab, 61, has been chief executive officer of National Retail Properties, a publicly traded REIT with a market cap of approximately $6.5 billion, since 2004 and chairman of the Company's Board of Directors since 2008. Macnab will retire from National Retail Properties, effective April 28, 2017. Prior to National Retail Properties, Macnab served as president and chief executive officer of Atlanta-based JDN Realty Corporation. Macnab has served as a director of American Tower Corporation's Board of Directors since 2014, and is a member of the Audit Committee. He is also a director of Cadillac Fairview Corporation, a Canadian commercial real estate company that is wholly owned by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Macnab served on the Board of DDR Corporation from 2003 to 2015, where he chaired the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and was a member of the Audit Committee and Executive Committee.
