About Forward Pharma A/S (NASDAQ:FWP)
Forward Pharma A/S is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the development of FP187, a formulation of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) for the treatment of several inflammatory and neurological indications, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The Company's clinical candidate, FP187, is under development for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and other immune disorders, such as psoriasis. The Company's DMF formulation, FP187, employs over two methods, which improves the release of DMF by reducing the peaks of monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in the bloodstream while maintaining overall DMF exposure levels, which, in turn, controls DMF's side effects. The Company has conducted a pre-clinical program and has completed several Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for the product FP187.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Forward Pharma A/S (NASDAQ:FWP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $25.00 (9.22% upside)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

We expect to receive total estimated net proceeds of approximately $198.8 
million, based on the initial public offering price, after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of this offering that are 
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, 
we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately 
$229.6 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions 
and expenses of this offering that are payable by us. 

As of June 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$244,000. We currently expect that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with a fully drawn down €8.4 million principal amount bridge
financing we entered into on May 30, 2014 with NBFPII, a fully drawn down
$10 million principal amount additional bridge financing we entered into on
August 6, 2014 with BVF Forward (an affiliate of BVF Partners LP, which is
itself affiliated with certain of our principal shareholders), and cash and cash
equivalents on hand, as follows:

• approximately $80 million for the clinical development of FP187 for the 
  treatment of RRMS; 

• approximately $25 million to fund the exploitation and protection of our 
  intellectual property rights (including in connection with oppositions and 
  interference cases); 

• approximately $22 million for the clinical development of FP187 for the 
  treatment of psoriasis; 

• approximately $12 million for execution of our pre-clinical program, for 
  our manufacturing activities, and for related Phase 1 clinical trials; and 

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition, where we expect
to incur up to $26.0 million of costs associated with research and development
in our fiscal year ending December 31, 2014, subject to timing of our
development activities. As of the date of this Prospectus, we cannot predict
with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received
upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend
on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of net
proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including our ability to
obtain additional financing, the relative success and cost of our research,
pre-clinical and clinical development programs, and whether we enter into
collaborations with third parties in the future. As a result, management will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will
be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical
trials or pre-clinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and our
other sources of cash are less than expected.

At present, we believe that the expected net proceeds of this offering, the
bridge financings we entered into on May 30, 2014 and August 6, 2014, and our
current cash and cash equivalents, will allow us to initiate a Phase 3 clinical
trial program for FP187 in RRMS, including the opening of approximately 200
investigational sites and the enrolment of approximately 700 subjects. We
further anticipate that the net proceeds would also enable us to complete the
initial Phase 3 trial in psoriasis. However, we anticipate that we will require
substantial additional capital to complete our development activities in RRMS
and psoriasis. We also anticipate that the net proceeds would be insufficient to
allow for the market authorization and commercialization of FP187. We further
note that it is difficult to predict our future liquidity requirements given the
uncertainty around the requirements associated with the development and
commercialization of new drugs, and we could exhaust our capital resources
earlier than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of 
deposit.


We are engaged in segments of the pharmaceutical and biotechnological
industries that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Large
pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic
institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research
organizations are commercializing or pursuing the development of products that
target immune disorders, including the same diseases we are targeting. If FP187
is approved for the treatment of RRMS, we expect it will face intense and
increasing competition as new products enter the RRMS markets and advanced
technologies become available. FP187 will face competition based on its safety
and effectiveness, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the
availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement
coverage, price, patent position and other factors. Our competitors may succeed
in developing competing products before we do, obtaining regulatory approval for
products or gaining broader acceptance in the MS market we are targeting.

We believe that our key competitor in the DMF space is Biogen. Biogen's
Tecfidera® was approved by the FDA for the treatment of RRMS on March 27, 2103.
Tecfidera® generated global sales of $2.08 billion from launch in April 2013
through June 30, 2014.

Other companies have also developed alternative therapeutic approaches for
the treatment of RRMS. These include Novartis AG whose Gilenya® is a once daily
oral dose drug to treat RRMS approved in September 2010, and Genzyme Corporation
(a subsidiary of Sanofi S.A.), which developed Aubagio®, a RRMS drug approved in
September 2012.

We also face competition from potential new entrants into the RRMS market.
For example, Receptos Inc. has a product candidate, RPC1063, in Phase 2/3
testing which, if successfully approved and launched would be a once daily oral
treatment for RRMS.

As we pursue the development of and FP187 is approved for the treatment of
psoriasis, we will similarly face intense competition in the psoriasis market.
This will include competition from products which have already been
commercialized and have gained market acceptance, as well as from products based
on new and advanced technologies.


Company Description
Forward Pharma A/S is a Danish biopharmaceutical company preparing to
initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial using FP187, a proprietary formulation of
dimethyl fumarate, or DMF, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS,
patients. Since our founding in 2005, we have worked to advance


 unique
formulations of DMF, an immune modulator, as a therapeutic to improve the health
and well-being of patients with immune disorders including MS. FP187, our
clinical candidate, is a DMF formulation in a delayed and slow release oral
dose, which we plan to advance for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, or
RRMS, and other immune disorders, such as psoriasis.

Our focus on Dimethyl Fumarate, or DMF

Oral drugs employing DMF as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API,
have been in use for over half a century. Today, DMF is the API found in
Tecfidera®, which Biogen Idec Inc., or Biogen, began selling for the treatment
of RRMS following approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in
March 2013 (and approval by the European Commission, or EC, in February 2014).
Tecfidera®, which is an oral dose of 480 mg of DMF daily (240 mg twice daily),
generated global sales from launch in April 2013 through June 30, 2014 of
$2.08 billion. DMF is also an API found in Fumaderm®, which has been sold for
the treatment of psoriasis since 1994 in Germany.

In 2004, a private Swedish company Aditech Pharma AB (collectively with its
successor-in-interest, a Swiss company Aditech Pharma AG, or Aditech),
controlled by Nordic Biotech General Partner ApS (an affiliate of one of our
largest shareholders), assessed the potential for DMF to become a significant
global product. Aditech specifically focused on the development of an innovative
delayed and slow release formulation of DMF, with the goal of limiting side
effects typically associated with DMF treatment.

We were founded in 2005 for the purpose of exploiting a patent family
Aditech filed relating to, among other things, its delayed and slow release
formulation for DMF, and in 2010 we acquired this patent family from Aditech.
Under our agreements with Aditech, we obtained, among other things, Aditech's
patents and associated know-how related to DMF formulations. 

The patent family that we acquired from Aditech included an international
patent application filed on October 7, 2005, disclosing, among other things,
formulations of DMF that provide for its slow release in the small intestine,
where we believe that DMF has its immunomodulatory impact. This international
application became the basis for a family of national patent applications which
were subsequently filed relating to DMF. Two European patents, one from the
original Aditech patent family and one from a patent family of ours (involving
erosion matrix formulations of DMF with a thin enteric coating) have been
granted and both are now the subject of opposition proceedings (i.e., special
proceedings heard by the European Patent Office, or EPO, where one or more third
parties request that the patent, or a part thereof, be revoked) which have been
instigated by multiple third parties. In the U.S. our Erosion Matrix Patent
application has been allowed and we have pending patent applications that we
believe will soon be allowed (i.e., will meet the statutory requirements of
patentability), one of which claims particular up-titration schedules
(e.g., increasing the dose over a specified number of weeks) of using DMF to 
treat MS, and the other of which claims treating MS using particular 
compositions containing DMF and that also specifies levels of a DMF metabolite 
called mono methyl fumarate, or MMF, in the bloodstream. These claims are 
substantially the same as the respective claims in two other applications that 
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, Examiner recently found 
allowable but which we elected to abandon (i.e., voluntarily requested to be 
irrevocably removed from the USPTO docket of active patent applications). In 
another of our patent applications, U.S. Patent Application No. 11/576,871, 
the USPTO Examiner has found our claims directed to methods of treating MS 
using a 480 mg dose of DMF to be allowable and has recommended that an 
interference be declared against Biogen's U.S. Patent No. 8,399,514 and a 
USPTO official has indicated that we will be designated as the so-called senior 
party. An interference is an administrative proceeding at the USPTO that is 
used to determine which party is the first to invent a common invention claimed 
by the parties. The party with the earliest effective filing date to the common 
invention is designated "senior party" and is entitled to the presumption that 
it is the first inventor. Once an interference has been suggested, a supervisory 
Examiner refers the suggested interference to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, 
or PTAB. An administrative patent judge at the PTAB declares the interference 
and administers the proceeding. During the interference, each party can dispute 
the patentability of the other parties' claims, challenge the senior party 
designation and present proof of dates of invention prior to the effective 
filing date. In an initial motions phase, a three judge panel at the PTAB 
decides the patentability and senior party issues raised and, if that decision 
does not resolve the interference, then after priority proofs are submitted in 
a second priority phase, enters final judgment on priority (i.e., who is first 
to invent). 

On August 22, 2014, an administrative law judge at the PTAB returned our
U.S. Application No. 11/576,871 to the patent examining group within the USPTO,
or the Examining Group, in which our USPTO Examiner is assigned. Based on an
earlier discussion with a USPTO official, we believe the return is to address
formal matters. However, we do not know whether the return has any accompanying
communication to the Examining Group and we cannot rule out the possibility that
the return was made for substantive reasons, which may adversely affect, delay
or prevent our planned interference proceeding. 

In order to assess FP187's safety profile for human use, we have performed
28 pre-clinical studies on DMF since 2006, gathering data through animal testing
(and in certain cases in vitro testing of DMF in cells) on its pharmacological
activity, toxicity profile, and on dosing level effects. All pre-clinical
studies apply to both MS and psoriasis development. Beginning in 2007, we
commenced a set of Phase 1 clinical trials followed by a Phase 2 clinical trial
to investigate, among other things, safety and dosing tolerability of FP187. We
have successfully completed all of these clinical studies, collectively
involving over 300 psoriasis patients and healthy volunteers, and gathering
substantial positive safety and dosing data. Importantly, as of the date hereof
we have conducted no clinical trials involving patients with MS.

To advance FP187 for use as a drug to treat RRMS in the U.S., we held a
pre-Investigational New Drug, or IND, application meeting with the FDA in August
2013. Prior to this pre-IND meeting, we submitted a briefing book to the FDA,
which included our high-level description of a proposed 48-week Phase 3 trial,
which we expect will include up to 2,000 RRMS patients. We intend to compare
FP187 to an active beta interferon, or IFN, comparator drug. The primary
efficacy endpoint for the proposed Phase 3 trial will be the Annualized Relapse
Rate, or ARR. The key secondary efficacy endpoint will be the Sustained
Accumulation of Disability, or SAD, based on repeated assessments of the
Expanded Disability Status Scale, or EDSS. Further secondary endpoints are based
on magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, markers.

EDSS has been recognized by the EMA as the most widely used and known scale
to assess disability in RRMS patients. EDSS scores are measured periodically
(generally in intervals of three to six months) based on a standard neurological
examination of seven major functional systems and observations concerning gait 
and use of assistive devices. EDSS is reported using a scale ranging from 0 to 
10 in 0.5 unit increments that each represent higher levels of disability. 
SAD is defined as a specified increase from baseline in EDSS that persists for 
at least 12 weeks. 

Consistent with our pre-IND meeting and submissions, we filed our IND for
RRMS on April 30, 2014 and expect to be able to submit the protocol and draft
Statistical Analysis Plan, or SAP, for our Phase 3 study in the fourth quarter
of 2014.

Following completion of our planned Phase 3 trial, we intend to submit our
NDA for FP187 to treat RRMS. Approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application, or
NDA, is dependent on a number of factors. A final decision as to whether the
program we shared with the FDA in advance of our pre-IND meeting is sufficient
for approval (including the sufficiency of our proposed single Phase 3 trial and
whether a favorable effect on SAD or other secondary endpoints will need to be
demonstrated by us at the time of our NDA submission) can only be made by the
FDA once it has reviewed our full NDA package.

We expect that patient enrollment for the Phase 3 trial we are contemplating
will take at least 18 months, with completion of the final patient's initial
48-week treatment period after a total of 30 months. When the last patient dosed
has completed the 48-week treatment period, we expect that we will have a
substantial number of patients with two years of data, which we believe will
allow us to complete an analysis of the effects of FP187 on SAD which can be
provided to the FDA when we submit our NDA. As a result, we believe that any
requirement by the FDA for data on EDSS/SAD will not delay a decision on whether
to approve FP187 for the treatment of RRMS.

We intend to submit our NDA for FP187 to treat RRMS under Section 505(b)(1)
of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, based on
pre-clinical and clinical data we have and will have developed and independently
own. Section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act prescribes how a product may be submitted
for approval by the FDA as a new drug based on clinical trial data and other
information independently developed and owned by the party making the NDA
submission, or obtained from a third-party with a right of reference.

In Europe, we have held preliminary discussions concerning marketing
authorization for FP187 in moderate to severe psoriasis with the Federal
Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und
Medizinprodukte, or BfArM) in Germany, and more recently in November 2013 held a
scientific consultation on FP187 for the treatment of MS with the European
Medicines Agency, or EMA. We expect to apply for a European Union, or EU,
marketing authorization for FP187 to treat RRMS.

We also intend to pursue the development of FP187 for the treatment of
psoriasis, and expect to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial program for
psoriasis, including the commencement of dosing of patients by early 2015.
