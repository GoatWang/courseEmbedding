Stabilis Capital Management has closed its fifth fund at $525 million. Fund V’s investors included TRB Advisors. Stabilis invests mostly in commercial real estate loans.
PRESS RELEASE
July 5, 2017 New York, NY – Stabilis Capital Management, LP today announced it closed its Fund V with $525 million in commitments from investors. The closing of Fund V takes the firm’s raised funds to a total of $1.7 billion since its founding in 2010. The strong demand for Fund V at $525 million demonstrates not only the success of Stabilis, but also its investors’ confidence in the firm.
Stabilis’ success stems from innovative investments primarily in loans secured by commercial real estate with a prudent loan-to-value acquisition point. The firm focuses on identifying and creatively structuring new investment opportunities with high risk adjusted returns while mitigating downside risk.
“I am pleased with Stabilis’ success and delighted by our continued ability to serve our investors. We look forward to continuing to use our specialized focus to invest in high return opportunities that are primarily secured by real estate and where we believe a compelling loan-to-value acquisition point helps protect against downside risk,” said Stabilis co-founder and Managing Principal Salman Khan. “Despite the nearly decade long economic recovery in the US, Stabilis continues to find opportunities to purchase or originate high return opportunity loans secured by strong real estate assets where borrowers or sellers need access to liquidity quickly, allowing us to invest in attractive opportunities regardless of macroeconomic conditions.” 





Identifying, analyzing and structuring these opportunities are key to Stabilis’ success and have enabled the firm to create an attractive niche investment platform in the market. Stabilis plans to build on its record of success established with its previous Funds.
“Salman has built a first-class organization with a talented team and a strong pipeline of transaction flow and investment opportunities that is commensurate with the growth of the Funds. I believe that this, coupled with the strong returns that Stabilis has produced to date, is reflected in the increasingly positive response to the last several capital raises,” said Tim Barakett, Chairman of TRB Advisors LP (TRB). “All of these factors are hallmarks of Stabilis’ accomplishments to date and indicators of what we see for the future of Stabilis.”
“Stabilis continues to provide TRB and all of its investors with consistent, attractive and stable returns,” said Tim Barakett. “TRB has witnessed firsthand the growth of Stabilis and I am proud of what Salman has built. As I like to say, ‘performance is the product’ and Salman continues to deliver a great product.
TRB’s continued confidence in Stabilis’ investment strategy is evidenced by it continuing to be one of the largest investors in Stabilis Fund V.”
About Stabilis’ Investment Management:
Founded in 2010, Stabilis purchases and originates high return opportunity secured commercial loans with a strong margin of safety primarily in the United States. The firm is able to identify and invest in attractive opportunities because of the experience, expertise and long track record Managing Principal and co-founder, Salman Khan, and Stabilis’ 24-person investment team. Mr. Khan was formerly the head of the commercial industrial loan group at Silver Point Capital LP and, prior to that, spent 12 years at Goldman Sachs in various leadership positions leading to several successful investments in the US and Latin America. 





TRB Advisors LP (TRB) has been an investor and strategic partner of Stabilis since its founding. TRB is the family office of Timothy Barakett and Mr. Barakett serves as the non-executive chairman and co-founder of Stabilis with Mr. Khan. Prior to forming TRB, Mr. Barakett was the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Atticus Capital LP, a global investment management firm.
