 Career History



Chief Operating Officer

                                    2013 - Current                


CareView Communications, Inc.


                  CareView™ is the next generation of patient care monitoring. Unlike any other company in healthcare today, we have introduced the most perceptible element of patient care for nursing...continual, real-time monitoring and observation.

The CareView System® is a secure video monitoring system that connects the patient room to a touch-screen monitor at the nursing station, allowing nursing staff to maintain a level of visual contact with each patient. This capability also enhances usage of the nurse call system and reduces steps to and from patient rooms. Additionally, recording capability allows for a video record of all in-room activity during the length of the patient's stay.

This HIPAA compliant, patient approved video record can be included as part of the patient's medical record and serves as additional documentation of bed side care, procedures performed, patient and hospital ancillary activities, incidents, support for clinical and supportive services, technique and, if necessary, evidence.

Additional HIPAA compliance features allow for privacy to be enabled by the patient, nurse or physician at any time.

In addition to patient safety & security, the CareView System® also provides a suite of services to increase patient satisfaction scores and enhance the overall image of the hospital. GuestView™ includes first run, on-demand movies, Internet access via the patient television, and video visits with family and friends from anywhere in the world.

Through continued investment in patient care technology, CareView™ is helping hospitals and assisted living facilities build a safe, high quality healthcare delivery system that best serves the patient, while striving for the highest level of satisfaction and comfort

Community Health Systems, Inc.


                  Community Health Systems (CHS) is one of the nation's leading operators of general acute care hospitals. The organization's affiliates own, operate or lease more than 135 hospitals in 29 states, with an aggregate of approximately 20,000 licensed beds.

In more than 55 percent of the markets served, CHS-affiliated hospitals are the sole provider of healthcare services.

The consolidated organization owns and leases community hospitals that offer quality, cost-effective healthcare including a range of inpatient medical and surgical services, outpatient treatment and skilled nursing care.

In addition, through its QHR subsidiary, the organization provides hospital management, consulting, and advisory services to approximately 150 independent community hospitals and health systems throughout the U.S.

Headquartered in a suburb south of Nashville, Tennessee, the organization is committed to building a network of thriving hospitals vital to the residents and economic development of the communities served. With the belief that community hospitals often suffer from a lack of capital and have difficulty recruiting physicians and retaining high levels of management expertise, the company has assisted local hospitals in meeting these challenges and has proven itself to be an established leader in this industry segment.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

 Getting Started. 

Who We Are

There are no up-front costs to use the CareView Clinical Safety System.  There is a simple monthly fee per bed and all training, installation and support is included.

Implementation and installation is easy. The CareView System operates over your hospital’s existing coaxial network and VPN, and we work with your plant operations team to fit the equipment into rooms.

Patient privacy is always a concern when using cameras in a clinical setting. The CareView System is HIPAA-compliant and secure. It does not record any video images and includes consent processes and privacy options.


Typical Network Requirements

The CareView Clinical Safety System is very flexible and can be setup in a number of ways in order to satisfy hospital or system security and operational networking requirements. 

Generally, CareView is a closed system with interfaces to the hospital infrastructure for:


Internet access (dedicated access- business class of T1 or VPN, B2B VPN)

VLAN to allow nurse station monitors to connect to CareView servers

Access on the same VLAN for the hospital’s HL7 engine to route messages to the CareView server

WiFi access should you be using the CareView Connect mobile device or SitterView tablet

Implementation typically includes a simple one-way ADT feed from the Hospital’s HL7
