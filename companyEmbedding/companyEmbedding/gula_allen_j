This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Job Details
               The Mountains of Hope Foundation was established in 2003 by Marilyn B. Gula, who was diagnosed with a form of breast cancer in 1996. Although controlled by powerful drugs, the cancer continued to recur until the drugs were ineffective and she lost her battle with this insidious disease on July 26, 2006. As a result, the Mountains of Hope Foundation has been renamed "The Marilyn B. Gula Mountains of Hope Foundation" to honor her memory and continue the work she began. The Marilyn B. Gula Mountains of Hope Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charity - Federal ID 26-1294797. All expenses associated with the administration of the Foundation are paid by the Allen J Gula, Jr. and Marilyn B. Gula Trust. Every dollar donated is applied directly to fulfill our mission - to give women with advanced breast cancer a fighting chance. The Marilyn B. Gula Mountains of Hope Foundation is a 501 (c)(3) charitable organization. All donations are tax-deductible as allowed by law.

Estimated Delivery times for the Carports & Metal Garages


7 days to 30 days:  25%



30 days to 60 days:  60%


60 days to 90 days:  15%


90 days or more:  less than 1%


The estimated delivery time frames are not guaranteed, but approximately 85% of the time the delivery is occurring within 60 days of the order being received by the factory.  About 15% of the time the wait could extend to 90 days; however, it should rarely extend beyond 90 days, except in the winter months.  Please keep in mind that if you are in an area that receives any kind of winter weather, there is a greater chance of this exceeding the 90 day estimate because winter weather can make it difficult to complete an installation.


If your carport or metal garage goes over 90 days we will either offer upon your request a 10% discount off of the balance due once it is installed for the inconvenience or provide a full refund of your deposit if you wish to cancel.


Special Note For Orders Placed After October 1st:


Any installations/deliveries occurring in: DC, IN, MD, NJ, NY, OH & PA, will most likely be delayed until Spring, due to common winter storms in these states.  Please be advised that during October 1 - Spring, the 90 day delivery guarantee does not apply, as there is a high probability these customers will have an extended wait.

Metal garage buildings add valuable space for storage, workshop use, 
and more. They're a fantastic addition to any home or business. Alan's 
Factory Outlet offers a wide range of metal garages for sale online. Our
 customizable metal garage kits mean that your new garage will meet your
 specific needs. Our metal garages come in 3 different styles: The 
regular style steel garage, boxed eave style steel garage and the 
vertical roof steel garage.


The regular style garage is the only one that comes in a rounded barn
 shaped roof. The regular style steel carports are the most economical 
of the 3 roof lines you can buy.



	The boxed eave and vertical buildings look exactly alike at first 
glance, but with one major difference; how the roof sheeting runs. On 
the boxed eave metal garage the 29 ga sheeting runs length wise just 
like on the regular style, but on the vertical roof garage the sheeting 
goes up and down, which helps the snow or rain slide off. The vertical 
steel garage is the most expensive style of our metal garages for sale, 
but is the strongest of the three garages.



	When you order from Alan's Factory Outlet, you save on shipping and 
installation fees. Please note that our metal garages are currently 
available for delivery in sixteen states. The metal garages are 
delivered and installed for free only in these states: Alabama, 
Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, 
Virginia and West Virginia.


	When you buy the metal garage online your credit card with be processed only between 10% to 16% deposit after you approve the order on the 
metal garages.   The initial deposit can be paid with credit card or 
check. The remaining balance is due after it is built or installed, and 
can be paid with either credit card or check, whichever is best for you.



	The difference between the boxed and vertical roof style is the 
vertical buildings are made with the roof panels going up and down so 
snow easily slides off the roof.


Please keep in mind the steel garages are only delivered and 
installed in AL, AR, GA, IL, KS, KY, LA, MS, MO, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA,
 and WV.

Alan's Factory Outlet metal carports and metal garages are built different in Delaware, District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania such as fully braced with the tubing 4' on center but due to the additional labor and materials the price on the metal buildings in these northern states is more. If you’re located in one of these states please feel free to call Alan's Factory Outlet at 1-800-488-6903 so we can price out the carport or garage so you know the price difference. You can still order online just remember the price will have to be adjusted to the 4' on center and fully braced prices if you order online and are located in IN, OH, PA, MD, NJ, NY, and DC. You can also order by phone if you prefer. One other state that has different prices on the steel buildings is in Florida because all the structures in FL are required to be built certified for 150 mph. On the FL orders the price will be adjusted to meet the state specs and you will get a chance to approve and sign the order before you are charged the deposit to make sure you are good with the price.




	We strongly recommend that if you get a steel building that is 41' 
long to go with the vertical roof, because we do not have 41' long 
panels; which means we have to overlap 2 panels and this creates a week 
spot and an area that is prone to leakage issues. On the vertical 
garages because the roof panels are up you do not have that kind of 
situation.



	The metal garages for sale are custom built in the size, style and 
color you want. We can customize metal garage buildings to accommodate 
specific storage needs as we can custom build the structure with taller 
legs, larger garage doors, and thicker 12 ga tubing which has a 20 year 
rust through warranty. Size customizations are particularly helpful for 
your garage purchase if you're planning to store items like RVs, boats, 
and other outsized equipment. Additionally, all of the metal garages 
come with a 30 day craftsmanship warranty.


	When your order metal garage kits from Alan's Factory Outlets, you 
get to pick from 13 different colors for the roof, sides and the trim 
color which is on the end along the roof line sides. All of the metal 
sheeting comes in 29 ga and has a baked enamel finish.



	The 
tubing on the carports comes standard in 14 ga 2 1/2" square tubing. You
 can always upgrade to thicker 12 ga tubing, which is sized at 2 1/4" 
square tubing and has a 20 year rust through warranty. The 14 ga 
standard tubing doesn't have any rust through warranty.

Estimated Delivery times for the Carports & Metal Garages


7 days to 30 days:  25%



30 days to 60 days:  60%


60 days to 90 days:  15%


90 days or more:  less than 1%


The estimated delivery time frames are not guaranteed, but approximately 85% of the time the delivery is occurring within 60 days of the order being received by the factory.  About 15% of the time the wait could extend to 90 days; however, it should rarely extend beyond 90 days, except in the winter months.  Please keep in mind that if you are in an area that receives any kind of winter weather, there is a greater chance of this exceeding the 90 day estimate because winter weather can make it difficult to complete an installation.


If your carport or metal garage goes over 90 days we will either offer upon your request a 10% discount off of the balance due once it is installed for the inconvenience or provide a full refund of your deposit if you wish to cancel.


Special Note For Orders Placed After October 1st:


Any installations/deliveries occurring in: DC, IN, MD, NJ, NY, OH & PA, will most likely be delayed until Spring, due to common winter storms in these states.  Please be advised that during October 1 - Spring, the 90 day delivery guarantee does not apply, as there is a high probability these customers will have an extended wait.

Alan's Factory Outlet has a wide variety of metal carports for sale. When you order a carport online with Alan's Factory Outlet, you have a choice of 3 different roof styles. The 3 different styles are regular, boxed eave and vertical roof steel carports. The regular style carports are the most economical of the 3 roof lines offered for sale online. Carports need to function properly in all weather conditions, so carefully consider your area's climate when you buy a new carport.


The regular style is the only one that comes in a rounded barn shaped roof. The regular style steel looks exactly alike at first glance but with one major difference and that would be how the roof sheeting runs. On the boxed eave carport the 29 ga sheeting runs length wise just like the boxed eave and vertical car ports with the regular style, but on the vertical roof carport the sheeting goes up and down which helps the snow or rain slide off. The vertical carport is the most expensive to purchase but is the strongest of the three carports.


On vertical roof the roof sheeting runs up and down. Designed for rain and snow to slide off of it.


Alan's Factory Outlet makes purchasing your new car port online easy and efficient. When you buy the metal carport online your credit card will only be processed between 10% to 16% deposit after you approve the order on the metal carports. The initial processing fee can be paid with credit card or check. The remaining balance is due after it is built or installed, and can be paid with either credit card or check, whichever is best for you.

Save on installation and shipping when you order with Alan's Factory Outlet. We currently offer metal carports sales in sixteen states. The metal carports are delivered and installed for free only to these states: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.
	



Alan's Factory Outlet metal carports and metal garages are built different in District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania such as fully braced with the tubing 4' on center but due to the additional labor and materials the price on the metal buildings in these northern states is more. If you’re located in one of these states please feel free to call Alan's Factory Outlet at 1-800-488-6903 so we can price out the carport or garage so you know the price difference. You can still order online just remember the price will have to be adjusted to the 4' on center and fully braced prices if you order online and are located in

 IN, OH, PA, MD, NJ, NY and DC. You can also order by phone if you prefer. One other state that has different prices on the steel buildings is in Florida because all the structures in FL are required to be built certified for 150 mph. On the FL orders the price will be adjusted to meet the state specs and you will get a chance to approve and sign the order before you are charged the deposit to make sure you are good with the price.

		The difference between the boxed eave and vertical roof style is the metal sheeting on the vertical roof is up and down which helps snow or rain slide off of the roof. The vertical style is the strongest style and we strongly recommend the vertical style on any carports 41' long because the longest roof paneling we have is a 36' long section.
	

If you're ordering a new car port online, please keep in mind the steel carports are only delivered and installed in AL, AR, GA, IL, KS, KY, LA, MS, MO, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA and WV.
		
 One of the benefits of ordering your carport online with Alan's Factory Outlet is that you can customize your carport to meet your needs. In fact, the carports at Alan's Factory Outlet are custom built in the style, size and color you want. The leg heights on them can be made taller in 1' increments to fit a wide variety of items such as an RV, motor home, tractor, tractor trailer, cars, trucks, farm equipment and a boat to name a few.
	




Before you purchase, browse carport color options online. Carports can enhance your property's attractiveness so make the most of your color choices. The 13 different colors available apply to the roof and the trim which is on the end along the roof line. If you close the sides you also get to pick the color for the sides. All of the metal sheeting comes in 29 ga and has a baked enamel finish.
		
 The tubing on the carports come standard in 14 ga 2 1/2" square tubing. You can always upgrade to a thicker 12 ga tubing which is sized at 2 1/4" square tubing and has a 20 year rust through warranty. The 14 ga standard tubing doesn't have any rust through warranty.
	
    You can put down either a level gravel pad or a concrete pad. If you are putting down a gravel pad we recommend making the gravel pad 2' longer and 2' wider than the size you order. If you are putting down a concrete pad here is a list of the recommended concrete pad size for each size carport or metal garage.

*The
reason the pad size needs to be 1' less on the length is because
		

the listed size includes a
6" front and back end overhang.  Make
sure you do not have any bolts sticking up out of the concrete.  We just need a level flat concrete pad as we
will anchor it to the concrete for free and our holes are in different
locations.
	
Estimated Delivery times for the Carports & Metal Garages


7 days to 30 days:  25%



30 days to 60 days:  60%


60 days to 90 days:  15%


90 days or more:  less than 1%


The estimated delivery time frames are not guaranteed, but approximately 85% of the time the delivery is occurring within 60 days of the order being received by the factory.  About 15% of the time the wait could extend to 90 days; however, it should rarely extend beyond 90 days, except in the winter months.  Please keep in mind that if you are in an area that receives any kind of winter weather, there is a greater chance of this exceeding the 90 day estimate because winter weather can make it difficult to complete an installation.


If your carport or metal garage goes over 90 days we will either offer upon your request a 10% discount off of the balance due once it is installed for the inconvenience or provide a full refund of your deposit if you wish to cancel.


Special Note For Orders Placed After October 1st:


Any installations/deliveries occurring in: DC, IN, MD, NJ, NY, OH & PA, will most likely be delayed until Spring, due to common winter storms in these states.  Please be advised that during October 1 - Spring, the 90 day delivery guarantee does not apply, as there is a high probability these customers will have an extended wait.
