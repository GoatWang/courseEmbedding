The Stages in Venture Capital Investing


    By Investopedia 






Share



















































Venture capital is a source of financing for new businesses. Venture capital funds pool investors' cash and loan it to startup firms and small businesses with perceived, long-term growth potential. This is a very important source of funding startups that do not have access to other capital and it typically entails high risk (and potentially high returns) for the investor. Most venture capital comes from groups of wealthy investors, investment banks and other financial institutions that pool such investments or partnerships. This form of raising capital is popular among new companies, or ventures, with a limited operating history that cannot raise capital though a debt issue or equity offering. Often, venture firms will also provide start-ups with managerial or technical expertise. For entrepreneurs, venture capitalists are a vital source of financing, but the cash infusion often comes at a high price. Venture firms often take large equity positions in exchange for funding and may also require representation on the start-up's board. The Stages in Venture Capital (VC) InvestingAngel investors are most often individuals (friends, relations or entrepreneurs) who want to help other entrepreneurs get their businesses off the ground - and earn a high return on their investment. The term "angel" comes from the practice in the early 1900s of wealthy businessmen investing in Broadway productions. Usually they are the bridge from the self-funded stage of the business to the point that the business needs true venture capital. Angel funding usually ranges from $150,000 to $1.5 million. They typically offer expertise, experience and contacts in addition to money. Seed - The first stage of venture capital financing. Seed-stage financings are often comparatively modest amounts of capital provided to inventors or entrepreneurs to finance the early development of a new product or service. These early financings may be directed toward product development, market research, building a management team and developing a business plan. A genuine seed-stage company has usually not yet established commercial operations - a cash infusion to fund continued research and product development is essential. These early companies are typically quite difficult business opportunities to finance, often requiring capital for pre-startup R&D, product development and testing, or designing specialized equipment. An initial seed investment round made by a professional VC firm typically ranges from $250,000 to $1 million. Seed-stage VC funds will typically participate in later investment rounds with other equity players to finance business expansion costs such as sales and distribution, parts and inventory, hiring, training and marketing. 
Early Stage - For companies that are able to begin operations but are not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales, early stage financing supports a step-up in capabilities. At this point, new business can consume vast amounts of cash, while VC firms with a large number of early-stage companies in their portfolios can see costs quickly escalate. 
Start-up - Supports product development and initial marketing. Start-up financing provides funds to companies for product development and initial marketing. This type of financing is usually provided to companies just organized or to those that have been in business just a short time but have not yet sold their product in the marketplace. Generally, such firms have already assembled key management, prepared a business plan and made market studies. At this stage, the business is seeing its first revenues but has yet to show a profit. This is often where the enterprise brings in its first "outside" investors.
First Stage - Capital is provided to initiate commercial manufacturing and sales. Most first-stage companies have been in business less than three years and have a product or service in testing or pilot production. In some cases, the product may be commercially available. 
Formative Stage - Financing includes seed stage and early stage.
Later Stage - Capital provided after commercial manufacturing and sales but before any initial public offering. The product or service is in production and is commercially available. The company demonstrates significant revenue growth, but may or may not be showing a profit. It has usually been in business for more than three years.
Third Stage - Capital provided for major expansion such as physical plant expansion, product improvement and marketing.
Expansion Stage - Financing refers to the second and third stages.
Mezzanine (bridge) - Finances the step of going public and represents the bridge between expanding the company and the IPO
Balanced-stage financing refers to all the stages, seed through mezzanine.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Composite Score:





                        Swift Capital has received 4.75 out of 5 stars based on 50 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

APR’s will not exceed 36.00%.  APR’s will vary based on state laws and regulations regarding allowable interest rates, fees, and lengths of loan terms.  Your credit history at the time of application, income, debt obligations, collateral, and to the extent applicable, prior loan experience with Torro Funding LLC are considered in determining eligibility and contract terms. There is no down payment and there is never a prepayment penalty.  Closing your loan is contingent upon your agreement to all of the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. 
For example, using a 42 month installment contract, a loan of $4,500 with an interest rate of 29.00% and an APR of 33.10% (inclusive of allowable fees), you would make 42 monthly payments of $172. 
TX Only: For example, with an amount financed of $4,500.00, at an APR of 30.26%, and a finance charge of $2848.00 you would make 42 monthly payments of $174.96, for a total of payments of $7348.00. The amount financed may not be the net proceeds paid to you if charges other than interest are included in the loan.
*All loans are subject to credit approval and normal underwriting standards. Minimum and maximum loan amounts, rates, fees, terms and collateral requirements are subject to specific guidelines and may change without notice. All loans are made under Torro Funding LLC  of Utah  or it's affiliate lenders. Available cash amounts may vary and collateral requirements apply.
