Business as an Adventure
Argo Group’s Mark Watson avoided insurance, but it kept wooing him back.


By Mike Patten
 | November ’12




Tweet
























	You might say Mark E. Watson III has been a businessman since he was a boy. Infused with an entrepreneurial spirit, he understood early how to succeed. You might also say it was inevitable he wound up in the insurance industry, despite, as he claims, spending his whole life trying not to.


	“I’m probably more of an entrepreneur than I am anything else,” insists the 47-year-old president and CEO of Argo Group. “When I think about running Argo, I think about running a business that happens to be in the insurance business. I’m a finance guy. I didn’t grow up an underwriter. I can handle a claim if I need to, but for me it’s more about building a business that happens to be in insurance.”

FAST FOCUS  >> Watson had an entrepreneur’s spirit even as a child.  >> He’s overseen the company’s transformation to an international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products. >> Running Argo requires Watson to split time between his family in San Antonio and corporate HQ in Bermuda. 

Tweet

	Argo Group International Holdings is a $7 billion international specialty reinsurance company in niche areas of the property and casualty insurance market. Watson has overseen the company’s transformation from a U.S.-based p-c insurer specializing in workers comp to an international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products based in Bermuda with operations in the U.S., U.K., Brazil, continental Europe and the United Arab Emirates.

	“I’m confident that we’ve built a business that really works,” Watson says. “The strategy that we have today isn’t really any different than it was 10 years ago. We went from $200 million in premium to $2 billion at the end of 2009, but we also had discipline along the way to say, ‘We’re in a soft market; let’s pull back.’ We acquired a lot of business. Really, over the last three to four years we’ve been merging three public companies together and creating one.

	“Now we’re growing again, and we feel pretty comfortable that we’re in the right places. I think having a good spread of risk will help us. It certainly gives us more options, but I think it also gives us better perspective. As the world moves ahead, we have a better opportunity to move with it.”

‘Sailing is quite an incubator to practice leadership.’

	Watson says Argo Group invests in industries that he thinks can grow: energy, technology, professional services and water. He has watched the Dow reclaim levels last seen before the crash of 2008 yet says that recovery hasn’t reached small business, one of Argo Group’s core constituencies.

	“Most job creation comes from small employers, not large employers,” he says. “Small businesses really haven’t gotten going again yet. In the U.S., we mainly insure small businesses, so it’s hurt our top line. I think competitive pressure has hurt even more, which is why we’ve kind of been holding back the last few years. But I worry that, if we don’t get small business going again, the economy will continue to lag. Yes, we’ve seen the stock market going up, but a lot of that is coming from corporate efficiency. Where does that leave the future?”

TEEN ENTREPRENEUR
	As a boy, Watson never thought his future was insurance. One of his grandfathers was a wildcatter who discovered oil in west Texas, and that path initially captured his interest.

	“I grew up with all those stories, and I thought, you know, that’d be kind of fun,” Watson says. “But at the time I was graduating from college in 1986, the oil and gas business was on its knees.”

	In fact, he had a summer job at an oil and gas company during the time that it was being acquired. “I met the banker who was doing the deal,” Watson recalls, “and I realized, ‘You know, this is not all that different, just a different sort of challenge—maybe I’ll be an investment banker.’ Except the timing didn’t exactly pan out on that one either—the crash of 1987 occurred, and that didn’t work out so well. So I went to New York and joined a law firm.”

‘Growing up, it never occurred to me that I couldn’t accomplish what I wanted to do.’  

Tweet

	Insurance, though, was never far away. Watson’s other grandfather was a San Antonio mortgage banker who also owned a small insurance agency. Watson’s father, Mark Watson Jr., took over the firm and turned it into one of the top agencies in San Antonio before founding his own company, Titan Holdings, which operated specialty property and casualty insurers and related services companies.

	“My father used to bring me to his office on Fridays each summer, and I’d just sit and watch him,” the younger Watson says. “When I worked for him between college and law school, he’d have me come sit in his office after my work was finished every day at five, and I would listen to him tying up all the loose ends on the phone and talk with him afterwards. I didn’t realize until many years later how much I learned from watching him run his business. It’s amazing how much you can end up taking in from early experiences like those.”

	Watson had an entrepreneur’s spirit even as a child. “I remember as a Boy Scout we’d go away on a camping trip about once a month, and each time I’d get my mother to let me buy $20 worth of candy to take with me. I’d always come back with $50 in my pocket because none of my friends’ parents would allow them to bring candy with them. I had a captive audience,” he says.

TOUGH LOVE
	His parents were divorced, so he split time between his mother’s home in Houston and his father’s home in San Antonio. He credits both parents for his success.

	“There are two kinds of parents,” he says. “There’s the soft kind and the tough kind, and I got the tough kind. My mother stressed proper behavior, and manners were very important to her, but she also had enough trust in me to let me do my own thing. I may have learned a lot about how to run a business from my father, but it was my mother who instilled in us the belief that we can do anything if we work and try hard enough. Growing up, it never occurred to me that I couldn’t accomplish what I wanted to do.”

	Watson earned his undergraduate degree from SMU and his law degree from the University of Texas. From there, he headed to New York, where he was an associate attorney with Kroll & Tract, a law firm focusing on international financial services, including insurance. Within a couple of years, he returned to San Antonio as general counsel at Titan Holdings and worked with his father to take the company public. He stayed six years, helping guide the firm through its initial listing on Nasdaq, then on the New York Stock Exchange and then through back-to-back acquisitions by USF&G and St. Paul Insurance.

	Not wanting to be part of a large organization, Watson left St. Paul a few months later to take a little time off to get married. But time off didn’t suit him. The urge to try a new adventure soon struck.

	Watson tried his hand as a venture capitalist, forming Aquila Capital Partners in Texas with a colleague. And here’s where it gets inevitable. During this time, he decided to accept an invitation to join the board of Argonaut Group, a $3.1 billion property and casualty insurance group based in California. A year later, he was asked to step in and take the reins as president and CEO.

	“I learned about the specialty business from being around my father both as a child and working for him at Titan for six years,” Watson says. “Within a year after joining the board at Argonaut, I was spending a lot of time promoting change and proposing that we focus more on the specialty area. My fellow board members eventually said, ‘Fine, why don’t you come do the job then?’”

	Watson moved Argonaut’s headquarters to San Antonio in 2001, and in 2007 Argonaut became Argo Group when it acquired Bermuda-based PXRE Group.

	“Our strategy hasn’t really changed,” Watson says. “What did change was the world around us. A number of new companies appeared in Bermuda. They were all capitalized with a billion dollars, and they very quickly started diversifying into other parts of not only the reinsurance business but the primary insurance business. I didn’t think it would be long until we started having to compete with them directly in the marketplace and that we better have the same competitive advantages they did by the time they got here.”

SHOP LOCAL
	Bermuda’s lower tax rates have made the island nation an attractive domicile for multinational firms, but Watson says that taxes weren’t the main reason for the move.

	“There is some benefit, but our effective corporate tax rate today isn’t appreciably less than it was a couple of years ago,” he says. “The real advantage is having a broader diversification of risk, which is more capital efficient, and also being down the street from our business partners. When the client and broker show up with millions of dollars of business, it’s good to have your shop window right there with everybody else because then you’re part of the deal. For me that was the real advantage.

	“The last bit is that the regulatory environment in Bermuda is much less complicated and more streamlined than in the U.S. If you want to build a new business in Bermuda, you need to talk to one regulator. If you’re going to start a new business in the United States, you’ve got to go to more than 50 separate regulators to accomplish the same thing. We have more than 10 insurance companies here in the U.S. as a part of our insurance group, and I can tell you having to deal with 50 different sets of regulations and dozens of state officials for each and every product we take to market requires a lot of time and expense.”

	The merger that made Argo Group an international company did not, however, do much to streamline Watson’s family life. Running the company now requires him to split time between his wife, Ana Paula, and their children in San Antonio and corporate headquarters in Bermuda.

	“You tend to find me in San Antonio on Mondays and Fridays,” he says. “I’m usually in Bermuda in the middle of the week, or I’m in our London office or in New York. We have such a decentralized business that I always seem to be traveling somewhere. People often ask: ‘Where do you spend most of your time?’ My short answer is, ‘In the air.’”

	But in his free time you can also find him on the water. He skippered a 90-foot boat called Genuine Risk in the last Newport-to-Bermuda race, winning the Royal Mail Trophy. In 2008, he won the Swan 42 National Championship and earlier this year competed in the Etchells World Championship in Sydney, Australia, against America’s Cup skippers.

	“Sailing is quite an incubator to practice leadership,” Watson says. “I remember when I was much younger and I was talking with my fellow board members about whether I should come run the company. They said, ‘OK, you’re a young guy. Give us some examples of leadership.’ I found myself telling more stories about yacht racing than I did about running Titan. It wasn’t that I didn’t have a lot of responsibility—I had hundreds of employees that I was responsible for. But when you bring five, six, 10 people together and put them on a boat with a singular goal where everyone is dependent on one another for their success—that takes a lot of practice and short, concise communication.

	“Yacht racing is chess on water. You’ve got to think about what your strategy is going to be to get around the racecourse. Running a business is very similar. You need to have the team all working together. You’ve got to figure out where you want to go, and ultimately you have got to find a way to get there before your competitors.”

	His colleagues describe Watson as affable, knowledgeable and an innovator.

	“Mark is a smart, grounded professional and lives his life passionately,” says Jonathan Brewin, commodore of the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club. “Although competitive, he also can have fun with his sport. For the Argo Group Pro Am Regatta, he brought a stash of large water guns so that his rivals could get suitably soaked during the regatta and then gave the water guns to the Optimists sailors from the Junior Gold Cup event, which made the youngsters very happy and resulted in a fun time on the dock.”

	Greg Case, Aon president and CEO, says he values spending time with Watson. “He is a trusted partner, and I very much appreciate the opportunity to spend time with him,” Case says. “Mark is thoughtful and decisive. He is recognized as an innovator and true strategic thinker.”

FATHERLY ADVICE
	“I remember one time when I was bristling about the state of the insurance business,” Watson says. “My father said, ‘I’m going to tell you something somebody told me when I was your age, and it’s the same for you: The grass isn’t greener on the other side, it’s just different, and the sooner you figure that out and how to do well what you already do, you’ll be a lot happier. You know what? It ain’t that bad.’ He’s right. I like what I do.

	“In the end, I didn’t end up in the energy business. I didn’t end up in the investment banking business. But I do work with investment bankers each week, and I share risk with energy companies every day. So I guess it all worked out OK after all.”

Mark E. Watson III


Helping Businesses Stay in Business


An Interview with Mark E. Watson III, President and Chief Executive Officer, 
	  Argo Group


Editors’ Note
In 1998, Mark Watson made an investment in Argo Group’s predecessor company, Argonaut Group, and joined its board of directors in 1999. He has overseen the organization’s development as a leading specialty underwriter since becoming its Chief Executive Officer in 2000. Earlier, Watson was a founding partner of Aquila Capital Partners, a venture capital firm. Before that, he was an executive vice president and member of the board of directors of Titan Holdings Inc., a NYSE listed company, from 1992 until its sale in 1997. Watson began his career as a Legislative Aid to Texas State Senator Donald Henderson, and he was an associate attorney with Kroll & Tract in New York City. He graduated with a B.B.A. in finance from Southern Methodist University and a J.D. from The University of Texas School of Law.
Company Brief
Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. (argolimited.com) is an international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products in the property and casualty market. Argo Group offers a full line of products and services designed to meet the unique coverage and claims handling needs of businesses around the world.
What has made Argo consistently strong and are the entrepreneurial growth companies your sweet spot or is it much broader?
It’s much broader. What has allowed us to do well over the past decade and a half has been a consistent strategy.
We’ve tried very hard to stay focused on building a leading specialty underwriter. Over time, our industry has become much more globalized so it’s not enough to just be a leader in the U.S.; one needs to have an international if not global presence and spread risk to be a leading specialty underwriter.
Every company takes a different path to get there and our path has been very entrepreneurial. We’ve made some very thoughtful acquisitions. We’ve used our capital very judiciously and, in some years, we have used our capital to acquire businesses in strategic markets. This is particularly the case with our Bermuda and our Lloyd’s platforms. In other years, when we thought it made more sense to give back capital, we have done that.
It’s about knowing when to seize the opportunities and when to stay back. Over the past few years, with the hugely competitive marketplace, we have held back from using our capital aggressively.
Having said that, we still grew the company and increased our geographic presence as well as our product portfolio during that period of time. We also attracted some incredibly talented people, which has made acquisitions less important than they were a decade or so ago.
How challenging is it to truly differentiate in this space when services can sound so similar?
Differentiation is hugely challenging in a crowded marketplace where everybody is watching everybody else. Many of our successes come from emulating what we believe to be some of our very best competitors while, along the way, we figure out how to do things for ourselves.
The real way to differentiate, however, is to make sure that, as an underwriter, we’re focused on meeting the needs of businesses as their risk management needs evolve.
Right now, there is much talk about cyber insurance. It’s not a new risk but, all of a sudden, business owners are starting to be much more aware of the risk as more companies like Target and Sony are attacked. This is probably one of the faster growing parts of our industry.
Whether it’s that coverage or another coverage, we have to make sure that we understand the needs of our customers and provide them with risk management products that help them instead of selling them what we, as an industry, have been selling everyone for the past several decades.
As more of the workforce becomes self-employed, another real trend that we’re at the forefront of is providing insurance products for those small-business professionals who are sole proprietors. We don’t just offer them a liability product or coverage for other interests they have; we offer them what they need when they need it. 
The next generation of insurance buyers will have different needs and we, as an industry, must find ways to meet their needs in a different way than we did a decade ago.
As needs change, is there an innovative edge within this industry?
Technology is huge right now. For over a decade, I have believed that technology would eventually disrupt our industry in a big way. Today, it’s finally happening quite quickly, and it’s allowing us to make insurance available to entrepreneurs on a much more specific basis. We can literally insure a project one minute and turn off risk the next. It’s technology that allows us to do that.
I can imagine us issuing insurance policies with tens of thousands of dollars in policy limit instead of millions of dollars in policy limit. I can imagine charging a premium that is hundreds of dollars, not thousands or tens of thousands of dollars and it takes a whole different business mindset to be able to do that. Of course, we need to have customers that recognize that need, but it’s a need that is certainly being expressed to us by small business owners.
New York City has put a major focus on bringing digital businesses to the city. Will you talk about some of the work you do in this area?
Much of our digital innovation is coming from New York and Silicon Valley, though the latter has more of a general tech focus. But in New York, we have the financial industry expertise to go along with it.
We keep hearing about the new tech companies or fin-tech companies. The reality is that they are not that different from the dot-com companies of 1999. Today, there is just more know-how about the industry in New York and there is plenty of tech in New York.
Not by accident, our New York Office is based in SoHo, not downtown. We’re in a great spot to pick up talented people. 
How critical is the work you do around securing start-up businesses?
Most new jobs in developed economies, and not just the U.S., come from small-business formation. The purpose of our company is to help businesses, particularly small businesses, to stay in business. It really is that simple – that’s our purpose. We want to be around to pay claims for our policyholders and help them manage their risk, while providing a good, stable work environment for our employees, generating a return for our shareholders, and looking after the communities where we operate. As the U.S. economy gets going again, we believe we’re in a great place to help new business of any size get going.•

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
