NOVATO, Calif., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Willis Lease Finance Corporation (NASDAQ:WLFC) (“Willis”), a leading lessor of commercial jet engines, announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Willis Engine Structured Trust III (“WEST III”) proposes to offer $335.7 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes (the “Notes”).  It is expected that the Notes will be issued in two series, with the Series A Notes to be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $293.7 million and the Series B Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $42 million.  The Notes will be secured by, among other things, WEST III’s direct and indirect interests in a portfolio of 56 aircraft engines.
The net proceeds of the Notes will be applied, in part, to pay fees and expenses related to the issuance and to pay Willis periodically over a 270-day delivery period in consideration for the aircraft engines acquired by WEST from Willis in the financing.  Willis will apply the net proceeds it receives to repay certain amounts drawn under Willis’ revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Notes being offered by WEST III have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  The Notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance in Regulation S under the Securities Act. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.  This news release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in this press release contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which give only expectations about the future and are not guarantees.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them.  Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the effects on the airline industry and the global economy of events such as terrorist activity, changes in oil prices and other disruptions to the world markets; trends in the airline industry and our ability to capitalize on those trends, including growth rates of markets and other economic factors; risks associated with owning and leasing jet engines and aircraft; our ability to successfully negotiate equipment purchases, sales and leases, to collect outstanding amounts due and to control costs and expenses; changes in interest rates and availability of capital, both to us and our customers; our ability to continue to meet the changing customer demands; regulatory changes affecting airline operations, aircraft maintenance, accounting standards and taxes; the market value of engines and other assets in our portfolio; and risks detailed in Willis’ Annual Report on Form 10-K and other continuing reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The London Stock Exchange does not disclose whether a trade is a buy or a sell so this data is estimated based on the trade price received and the LSE-quoted mid-price at the point the trade is placed. It should only be considered an indication and not a recommendation.Trades priced above the mid-price at the time the trade is placed are labelled as a buy; those priced below the mid-price are sells; and those priced close to the mid-price or declared late are labelled 'N/A'.

Specialty Lease Programs
Sale & Lease Back
Leaseback is a useful tool for companies needing working capital who do not want to use their bank lines, or have credit issues. With the Leaseback program, we can use the equity in your existing equipment to give your company the working capital it needs. We buy your equipment and lease it back to you. When all the payments are made, you own the equipment again. CLICK HERE to learn more.
Startup Program
A business less than two years old is generally considered a Startup. Most banks have severe limitations on extending credit to a Startup. Ironically it’s the time businesses are most in need. A new business needs the ability to build on opportunities and we can provide the capital to enable them to grow with our Startup Equipment Lease Program.
B, C and D Credit
The economic conditions of the last few years have caused many businesses financial suffering and many times that stress has spilled over into the owners’ personal credit profiles. More and more businesses fall into “B” credit category. Experts don’t expect this to change very soon. Even after the economy recovers, it takes time for the balance sheets and credit bureausto reflect stability. The picture isn’t any better for C and D credit tiers. There are good reasons we are more effective than other finance companies with B, C and D Credit:



Coastal Capital has always been an expert in non-standard finance programs.
20 years of non-standard loan originations, underwriting, back office, due diligence, loan structuring and collection.
Strategic partnerships with founders across America servicing a full spectrum of credit ratings and niche markets.
Access to non-standard capital resources capable of structuring “outside the box” solutions.
Alternatives to traditional Credit Based Leases including, Collateral Based Leasing and Cash Flow based Leasing. With some of our programs, credit scores have absolutely no bearing on underwriting. Our market position enables us to analyze business needs and structure finance offerings that are as appealing to funding institutions as they are to our clients. We can provide finance for the distressed business and can give problem credit clients a “second chance” to capitalize their businesses and rebuild their credit.



TRAC Leases
An acronym for Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause, this is specifically designed for over-the-road vehicles and trailers. A TRAC lease guarantees your business a pre-set buy out price for the vehicle when the lease expires. This type of equipment lease is a great tool for business owners who want the option of buying the vehicle for a pre-determined price at the end of the lease and typically offers lower payments than a standard lease while providing certain tax advantages.
Government and Municipal Leasing
We can provide lease financing to any government or municipal entity with guaranteed approval. The rate is determined by the rating of the municipality or government agency. We can finance any entity controlled federally, by any state or by any local municipality including Armed services, Public Schools, Libraries, Police and Fire Departments and more. Please contact us so one of our finance specialists can discuss your specific needs and how we can arrange the equipment financing your company requires.

Why Lease?
Leasing is the right choice!
80% of U.S. businesses, from Fortune 500 to the local family business, lease some portion of their equipment. By leasing your equipment, there is less impact on your cash flow, lower fixed monthly payments, preserves existing business credit lines, helps eliminate equipment obsolescence and has significant tax advantages. We can structure a lease for virtually any type of commercial equipment, including software and installation costs. A Business Equipment Lease from Coastal Capital Group Inc is the right choice.
Low monthly payments
The monthly lease payment will usually be lower than the payment required by other methods of financing.
Preserve your cash flow
Businesses need to preserve their capital to fund growth, expansion, and operations. Growing businesses need cash to expand and purchase new equipment. Established businesses need cash for operating capital, expansion opportunities, and replacement of old and obsolete equipment. With new equipment leasing, your upfront costs are minimal. You get the equipment you need and comfortably spread your payments out over time.
Preserve existing lines of credit
Business or Commercial Equipment Leasing has no impact on your bank credit lines. Protect your borrowing power for short-term capital needs for operations and opportunities.
Eliminate obsolescence
Technology is always advancing. Equipment you purchase today may be obsolete three years from now. New equipment leasing allows you the flexibility to maintain a competitive edge by giving you today’s best technology and allowing you to upgrade when the equipment has outlived its advantage.
Fixed payments through the term of the lease
Unlike bank lines of credit that usually have variable rates, lease payments are fixed. In the 1980’s rates rose from 9% to over 20% in one year causing severe hardship for many businesses. In 2008 and 2009 the financial markets were in turmoil and are still not completely stable. By choosing to lease, you protect yourself from market fluctuations outside of your control.
Significant tax and accounting advantages
Prudent businesses take advantage of the tax deductions for equipment as set out in section 179 of the US tax code. Lease payments are generally reported as line item expenses on your P&L statement instead of being depreciated over long terms. And since lease payments can usually be treated as a pre-tax business expense you can reduce your taxes. Paying cash for equipment automatically adds 30-40% to the cost when you realize that cash = profits and taxes are paid on profits.

Problem Credit Programs

Coastal Capital offers businesses with credit issues alternative business finance options. With 20 years of specializing in the bad credit lease and loan markets, we know how to deal with virtually any situation and formulate a solution to provide you with the business capital you need.
We invite you to call us for a no charge evaluation of your credit and finance needs by one of our certified business finance consultants. 
The Facts about Bad Credit Business Finance Options
There is no magic bullet that makes your credit look good if it is not. Don’t be lured into promises that anyone has any strings to pull or a special way to get you financing that you know you can’t get. And DO NOT give anyone money upfront without clearly detailed terms of your financing. A commitment deposit or documentation fee upon approval of a credit transaction is fine, but you should never have to pay just to have your application processed.
Why Can we offer the money to you when no one else can?
All banks, lending institutions and brokers have specific programs available to them. Either you fit in their mold or you don’t. Coastal Capital Group maintains strategic alliances with national lenders, as well as our own direct lending sister company, structured to fit any request we receive. If your business is capable of paying back the debt incurred, we can match you with a program. We identify the attributes of your business and navigate the various methods of securing capital to provide the funds you need.
We consider many factors to formulate a solution for your business including:



Type of Business
Your Use of Funds
Personal Credit Profile
Business Credit Profile
Business Cash Flows
Collateral Availability
Accounts Receivable On Hand
Future Sales Assumptions




Bad Credit Equipment Leasing
The credit markets have been in turmoil since early 2008. Lenders have raised their minimum credit scores and require considerable documentation to consider extending credit. At the same time the economic downturn has negatively affected the credit of many businesses and often has spilled over into the business owners’ personal credit profile. The combination significantly hinders a business’ ability to purchase new equipment they need to operate. Many businesses are being turned down for financing equipment. Repeating the same failed method to get the funds you need will only have the same result: failure.
Coastal Capital analyzes the business situation and navigates you in the direction that can provide the capital you need. If the credit score is the problem, we simply use a method that does not rely on credit scores. While people are most familiar with credit based lending, there are alternatives that will serve your purposes that do not take credit scores into consideration.
Click here for more on Equipment Leasing

Sale And Leaseback
Coastal Capital Group can provide working capital for your business using the equity in the equipment you own.
If your company owns equipment, you can get about half of the wholesale value in cash against it.  You make monthly payments over a fixed term, and at the end, you own it free and clear again.
The equipment value is the key here…not as much weight is placed on your credit.
The equipment must have individual wholesale value of at least $10,000 to qualify.  You can use several pieces as long as they each are worth $10k or more.

Leasebacks have several common uses, including:

Businesses with credit issues, or poor financials from a traditional banking viewpoint can still get the working capital they need by leveraging their owned assets
Secure capital without using your bank lines.
Take debt “off balance sheet”
Strategic tax planning purposes

Technically, we buy the equipment from you and lease it back to you until all payments are made, at which time you own it again free and clear.
It is a paper transaction.  We don’t actually take possession of the equipment.
Good For
Heavy durable equipment with a standardized wholesale market like:

Trucks and Other Vehicles
Construction Equipment
Farm Equipment
CNC machines
Forklifts

Not Good For

Items worth less than $10k
Computers and high obsolescent equipment
Restaurant Equipment-Very low wholesale values
Highly specialized equipment- items that wouldn’t have a readily available liquidation value

Simply complete a standard 1 page Equipment Lease Application and submit with the details on the equipment you intend to leaseback.

Asset Based Lending
Many businesses have equity built up in their existing equipment that they are not utilizing. The equipment you paid off over the past years can be leveraged to secure the funds you need for new equipment purchases. If you need to address the issue of bad credit equipment leasing, businesses can use some owned assets as additional collateral to secure a difficult finance request. It’s very simple: we offset risk with collateral. For bad credit business finance that may or may not be associated with an equipment purchase, you can use a Sale Leaseback to cash in the equity in your equipment and use the funds for any purpose you choose. We purchase your equipment for cash and lease it back to you. When the debt is paid, you own it again.

Cash Flow Based Lending
If a business has sufficient cash flow to pay back a loan, we can identify that and use it as a basis to structure a lending solution. Credit scores have no consideration in Cash Flow Based Lending. We would typically look at the bank statements for the past few months. If there is sufficient revenue to cover current expenses and the new debt, you qualify. You can get approved for bad credit equipment leasing because your credit is not what we’re looking for.

Business Credit Only Lending
While the vast majority of small businesses need to have a personal guaranty from the principles for the extension of credit, there are circumstances when the business may have good credit but the principle has had negative activity in their personal credit. While many business owners try to get credit in the company name alone in an attempt to circumvent their credit problems, very few qualify for “Corp Only” financing. Divorce, other business interests, health issues and other factors can damage the owner’s credit but not affect the business that needs the capital. If the business is well established, 5 years old or more, and has very strong financials, it may be possible to extend credit based on the business credit only. The principle will still sign, but the credit decision is not based on his or her credit score.

Alternative Business Finance Options
Other programs that can provide cash that can be used as an alternative for bad credit equipment leasing to purchase the equipment you need, or for bad credit business finance for working capital or cash for whatever you choose.

Accounts Receivable Financing
Very often businesses don’t realize they have a hidden asset they can use to secure capital. Your Accounts Receivables have value. If you need cash and you have money owed to you, we can purchase your receivables and give you the funds you need to meet your needs. You can sell all or part of your receivables. You can sell them one time or systematically assign new receivables on a regular basis. Accounts Receivable Financing, or Factoring as it is commonly referred to, is not based on your credit, but on the credit of your customers. The Factoring agent not only buys your accounts, but assumes the responsibility of collections. And if the account never pays, it does not affect you. You have no personal liability on the account.

Merchant Cash Advance
Another very useful source of capital is future assumable sales based on credit card processing. If you take credit cards, we can advance a portion of your future sales up front. You can draw 80-120% of your average monthly credit card transactions. We are assuming that if you have been accepting $50,000 per month for the last 6 months, you will for the next 6. The debt is paid back directly as a small percentage of your future credit card sales. If you have a slow month, your payment is less accordingly, and if business is strong, you pay back faster. The entire amount is typically paid in full in 6-12 months and you are able to re-draw more funds if you want any time after you’ve paid back just half of the initial advance.

While these are brief descriptions of the main finance avenues we explore for all of our clients, we offer many more bad credit business finance options. We can also develop hybrid structures of a combination of finance methods to meet your needs. At Coastal Capital Group, we have the experience and expertise in business finance to formulate a solution for your small business finance needs.

We Help Businesses Get the Working Capital They Need
Finally, small business owners can get the credit they need at reasonable rates with much easier credit requirements. We have several options available that can provide working capital to a wide variety of businesses based on cash flow-not just credit. In fact, the business owners credit score can be as low as 500 on the major credit bureaus.
Our low rate program utilizes a scoring system that only takes into account the last 2 years of credit history. This is extremely helpful to the many business owners who had credit problems in the recent past but are getting back on their feet. You are not penalized for older bad credit history. Your current ability to repay is what we consider. Many businesses experienced hard times through the economic crash of 2008, and many business owners credit was affected. Many were even forced into Bankruptcy or mortgage modifications. The major credit bureaus used by banks count bad accounts in your score for up to 10 years. If those issues occurred over 2 years ago, they will not be held against you!
Lower cost than common alternatives Our small Business Loans are as low as 1/7 of the cost of Merchant Cash advances but with almost the same easy credit requirements. An example of our best tier program has a payback on $10,000 of just $10,700 over 6 months. The average Merchant Cash Advance for 6 months would be $13,800 for the same funds. Even our lowest tier approval can save our clients up to half the cost of a Merchant Advance with the same easy credit requirements.
These are not Merchant Cash Advances. While Merchant Advances are useful for businesses needing fast funding with an easy repayment structure based on credit card volume, our small business short term loans offer loans based on your cash flow at a much lower cost. The two most important factors in determining how much your small business qualifies for is you average deposits, and average balances. Credit may affect which program you qualify for from our multiple platforms but we always place you on the platform which will look at your credit most favorably, whether it is using a standard score from one of the 3 credit bureaus, or a hybrid model which puts more weight on your more recent credit performance.

Many Businesses Can Benefit from Coastal Capital’s Short Term Small Business Loans
Any business that has regular steady cash flow through their business checking account can take advantage of our Short Term Small Business Loan Program. The more consistent your deposit history is, the better. Businesses that don’t work well would be those that only make very few monthly deposits. We’d rather see 20 deposits of $500 than 1 deposit of $50,000. Most businesses that operate day to day will qualify.
Restaurant Finance
Our program works great for Restaurant Loans. Restaurants have a high demand for working capital, especially to offset seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. Our Short Term Small Business Loans for Restaurants are the perfect answer to restaurant owners working capital needs. You get the funds you need, at reasonable rates, and pay back within the high season, not strapping yourself with debt to carry into the next slow season.
Furniture Retailers
We have a special program in place just for Furniture Retailers Business Finance. Although this industry has been restricted from many credit programs, even Merchant Cash Advances at significantly higher rates, we gladly provide working capital for furniture stores. Your good deposit history and bank balances are all we need to issue credit for you. We strive to have funds to you within 1 business day. The perfect solution to the cyclical cash flow demands of the retail furniture business.
Online Business Finance 
E-Commerce is big and getting bigger. Many Financial Institutions have restrictions on finance for e-businesses. We welcome your business. Coastal Capital provides the funds your online business needs to grow-even home based internet retailers.
Medical Working Capital
Medical practices have particularly intense capital requirements. Coastal Capital provides the working capital to support your practice. You can expand your practice, invest in newer technology, renovate your facility, finance Medical equipment or use the funds to assist with day to day cash flow. All with easy credit requirements and fast funding at reasonable rates.
Franchise Business Finance
Strong franchise relationships are valuable to franchisees. Successful franchise owners often have significant cash demands to implement programs mandated by the franchisor. We can provide the funds to address your short term capital needs with very lenient credit qualifications and favorable terms compared to popular alternatives, without the restrictive bureaucracy of typical bank finance.
Service Industries
You don’t have to be a retail business to take advantage of our Small Business Loans. Service providers are qualified too. The basis for our programs is the stability of your revenues. If your business regularly takes payments for services provided, you’re qualified!
Auto Service Center Business Loans
Auto service centers typically have good steady revenues that we can build credit. We help with the cash flow to keep your inventory stocked and equipment up to date. Running an auto service business has frequent high investment demands that we can fund quickly, at reasonable rates, and with credit requirements that are more than easy to qualify for.
Additional Small Business Loan Programs for High Risk Industries 
Coastal Capital has additional programs available for industries that are typically restricted from most finance programs. We might offset the higher risk with more conservative maximum funding amounts, or increased risk based costs, but there is practically no industry we cannot service.
Coastal Capital has specialty loan programs for all industries:

Auto Dealers Business Loans
Home Based Business Loans
Trucking Business Loans
Logging Business Loans
Cell Phone Retailer Business Loans
Accountants Offices Business Loans
Contractors Business Loans
Internet Marketers Business Loans
Tax Preparation Office Business Loans
Seasonal Businesses Business Loans
Travel Agency Business Loans

And many more. It’s all about the revenue stream of your business.
