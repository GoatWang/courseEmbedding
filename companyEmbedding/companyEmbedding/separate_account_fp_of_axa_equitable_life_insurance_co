Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.

Applicants' Representations
1. AXA Equitable is a New York stock life insurance company authorized to sell life insurance and annuities in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. AXA Equitable is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of AXA Financial, Inc. (“AXA Financial”). AXA Financial is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AXA, which is a publicly traded French holding company.
2. MLOA is an Arizona stock life insurance company licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in 49 states (not including New York), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AXA Financial is the parent company of MLOA.
3. AXA Equitable serves as depositor for Separate Account 45, Separate Account 49 and Separate Account A, which fund certain Contracts, and for Separate Account FP, which funds certain Life Insurance Contracts. AXA Equitable also serves as depositor for Separate Account 65, which funds group pension and profit-sharing plans under group Annuity Contracts issued by AXA Equitable (Separate Account 65 is also an “AXA Equitable Separate Account” and may be referred to herein as a “Separate Account” and collectively with MLOA Separate Account L and the AXA Equitable Separate Accounts, the “Separate Accounts”).
4. Each AXA Equitable Separate Account is a segregated asset account of AXA Equitable and, except for Separate Account 65, is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. Separate Account 65 is excluded from registration under the 1940 Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(11) of the 1940 Act. Units of interest in the AXA Equitable Separate Accounts, except Separate Account 65, are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”). Units of interest in Separate Account 65 are exempt from registration under the 1933 Act, pursuant to Section 3(a)(2) of the 1933 Act.
5. MLOA serves as depositor for MLOA Separate Account L, which funds variable benefits available under certain Life Insurance Contracts issued by MLOA.
6. MLOA Separate Account L is a segregated asset account of MLOA and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. Units of interest in MLOA Separate Account L under the Life Insurance Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act.
7. The Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and is registered as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A. The Trust is a series investment company and currently offers 21 separate series (each a “Portfolio” and collectively, the “Portfolios”).
8. The Trust currently offers two classes of shares, Class A and Class B shares. The Class A and Class B shares differ only in that Class B shares are subject to a distribution plan adopted and administered pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. The 12b-1 fees with respect to the Class B Shares of each Portfolio of the Trust currently are limited to an annual rate of 0.25% of the average daily net assets attributable to the Class B shares of the Portfolio and may be increased to an annual rate of 0.50% by the Board of Trustees without shareholder approval.
9. AXA Equitable currently serves as investment manager (“Manager”) of each of the Portfolios. The Trust has received an exemptive order from the Commission that permits the Manager, or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) with the Manager, subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, and without the approval of shareholders, to appoint, dismiss, or replace investment sub-advisers (“Advisers”) and to amend investment advisory agreements.[2] 
           If a new Adviser is retained for a Portfolio, Contract owners would receive notice of any such action.
10. Each Insurance Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Separate Accounts, proposes to exercise its contractual right to substitute a different underlying investment option for one of the current underlying investment options offered as a funding option under the Contracts. In particular, the Section 26 Applicants request an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed substitution (“Substitution”) of (i) Class A shares of the Multimanager Aggressive Equity Portfolio for Class A shares of the Multimanager Large Cap Growth Portfolio; and (ii) Class B shares of the Multimanager Aggressive Equity Portfolio for Class B shares of the Multimanager Large Cap Growth Portfolio.
11. The Section 26 Applicants propose the Substitution as part of a continued and overall business plan by each of the Insurance Companies to make its Contracts more attractive to existing Contract owners, Participants or prospective purchasers, as the case may be, and more efficient to administer and oversee.Start Printed Page 39996

12. Among the principal purposes of the Substitutions, the Section 26 Applicants assert the proposed Substitution is designed and intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the Contracts and the investment options available through the Separate Accounts. The Section 26 Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolio and the Removed Portfolio overlap and largely duplicate one another by having substantially similar investment objectives, policies and risks, and that consolidating the Removed Portfolio into the Replacement Portfolio would simplify the Contract prospectuses and related materials provided to Contract owners, thereby reducing the potential for Contract owner confusion.
13. The Section 26 Applicants believe that the deletion of an overlapping investment option should not adversely affect Contract owners and Participants given that a similar investment option will remain available under the Contracts and the Contracts will offer the same number of investment options or, in those cases where the number of investment options is being reduced, continue to offer a significant number of alternative investment options offering a full range of investment objectives, strategies and Advisers (currently expected to range in number from 27 to 66 after the Substitution versus 28 to 67 before the Substitution).
14. The Removed Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio have identical investment objectives and substantially similar investment policies. Each Portfolio seeks long-term growth of capital as its investment objective. Under normal circumstances, each Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities. Under normal circumstances, the Removed Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets in the equity securities of U.S. large capitalization companies, and the Replacement Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities, primarily investing in the securities of large capitalization growth companies but also investing, to a lesser extent, in the equity securities of small- and mid-capitalization growth companies. Although the Replacement Portfolio may invest in a broader range of companies to a greater extent than the Removed Portfolio, both Portfolios seek to achieve the same long-term investment goal by emphasizing investments in large capitalization U.S. companies.
15. Each Portfolio invests primarily in common stocks, but may invest in other securities that its respective Advisers believe provide opportunities for capital growth, such as preferred stocks, warrants and securities convertible into common stock. In addition, each Portfolio may invest in derivatives: the Removed Portfolio may invest up to approximately 10% of its net assets in futures and options, while the Replacement Portfolio may invest up to 25% of its net assets in derivatives, such as exchange-traded futures and options contracts on indices or other similar instruments.
16. To achieve its investment objectives, each Portfolio combines active and passive management strategies. With respect to each Portfolio, AXA Equitable allocates approximately 50% of the Portfolio's net assets to a portion of the Portfolio that seeks to achieve the total return performance of an index (the Russell 1000 Growth Index in the case of the Removed Portfolio and the Russell 3000 Growth Index for the Replacement Portfolio) while maintaining as minimal tracking error as possible (“Index Allocated Portion”). The Russell 1000 Growth Index includes those Russell 1000 companies (the 1,000 largest companies of the Russell 3000 Index) with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values, while the Russell 3000 Growth Index includes those Russell 3000 companies (the 3,000 largest U.S. securities) with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values. The Russell 3000 Growth Index generally has greater exposure to small- and mid-capitalization companies than the Russell 1000 Growth Index, and thus has greater exposure to the risks of investing in such companies. However, the average weighted market capitalization of each Portfolio is almost the same (approximately $76.3 billion for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and approximately $70.7 billion for the Russell 3000 Growth Index, each as of December 31, 2009).
17. With respect to each Portfolio, AXA Equitable allocates the remaining 50% of the Portfolio's net assets among the other portions of the Portfolio that are actively managed by multiple Advisers (the “Active Allocated Portions”) utilizing similar growth style strategies. The Active Allocated Portions of each Portfolio may invest, to a limited extent, in illiquid securities and in securities of foreign companies, including companies based in developing countries. The Replacement Portfolio's Active Allocated Portions may invest up to 25% of their total assets in foreign securities. The Active Allocated Portions of the Removed Portfolio also may invest in foreign securities, to a limited extent, but have no stated limit. Given the similarity between the Portfolios' holdings and investment objectives and strategies, the Trust intends to retain the Advisers to the Active Allocated Portions of the Removed Portfolio to manage the assets of the Active Allocated Portions of the Removed Portfolio that are transferred to the Replacement Portfolio in connection with the Substitution.
18. The Portfolios have substantially similar risk profiles. Each Portfolio is subject to the following principal risks: derivatives risk, equity risk, index strategy risk, large-cap company risk and leverage risk. The primary differences between the principal risks of the Portfolios are that the Replacement Portfolio also is subject to foreign securities risk, which is not a principal risk of the Removed Portfolio, and the Removed Portfolio also is subject to investment style risk, which is not a principal risk of the Replacement Portfolio. However, the Section 26 Applicants do not believe that these differences are significant. While the Replacement Portfolio has the flexibility to invest in foreign securities to a greater extent than the Removed Portfolio, each Portfolio's investments in foreign securities generally have been limited to a relatively small percentage of the Portfolio's assets. For instance, as of May 31, 2010, the Removed and Replacement Portfolios had invested approximately 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, in foreign securities. In addition, while the Removed Portfolio is subject to investment style risk because its Advisers primarily utilize growth investing styles, both of the Portfolios seek long-term growth of capital, invest in similar types of securities and generally are classified by third party mutual fund rating organizations as aggressive equity portfolios (e.g., Morningstar currently classifies each Portfolio as a large cap growth portfolio).
19. As provided in the chart below, the Section 26 Applicants anticipate that the Replacement Portfolio's total annual operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) will be lower than that of the Removed Portfolio immediately after the Substitution. The chart below compares the advisory fees and total annual operating expenses of the Class A and Class B shares of the Removed Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. Class A shares of each Portfolio are not subject to plans adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act.Start Printed Page 39997

As of December 31, 2009, the assets of the Replacement Portfolio were approximately $1.34 billion, while the assets of the Removed Portfolio were approximately $270 million.
20. The Section 26 Applicants currently expect that the proposed Substitution will be carried out on or about August 1, 2010, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (“Substitution Date”) and by supplements to the prospectuses for the Contracts and Separate Accounts, which were delivered to Contract owners and Participants at least thirty (30) days before the proposed Substitution, each Insurance Company will notify all Contract owners and Participants of its intention to take the necessary actions, including seeking the order requested by the application, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolio for the Removed Portfolio as described herein. The supplements advised Contract owners and Participants that, from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed Substitution, Contract owners and Participants are permitted to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit value) out of a Removed Portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers (or exchanges) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge, as applicable. The supplements also will inform Contract owners and Participants that the Insurance Companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed Substitution.[4] 
           The supplement also will advise Contract owners and Participants how to instruct the relevant Insurance Company, if so desired in light of the proposed Substitution, to reallocate Contract value from a Removed Portfolio subaccount to any other subaccount available for investment under their Contracts. In addition, the supplements will advise Contract owners and Participants that any Contract value remaining in a Removed Portfolio subaccount on the Substitution Date will be transferred to a Replacement Portfolio subaccount and that the proposed Substitution will take place at relative net asset value. The supplements will also advise Contract owners and Participants that for at least 30 days following the proposed Substitution, the Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners and Participants to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit value) out of a Replacement Portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers (or exchanges) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge, as applicable.
21. Each Insurance Company also has sent or will send Contract owners and Participants prospectuses for the Replacement Portfolio prior to the Substitution. The Section 26 Applicants have sent or will send the appropriate prospectus supplement (or other notice, in the case of Contracts no longer actively marketed and for which there are a relatively small number of existing Contract owners or Participants), containing this disclosure to all existing Contract owners and Participants. Prospective purchasers and new purchasers of Contracts will be provided with a Contract prospectus and the supplement containing disclosure regarding the proposed Substitution, as well as a prospectus and supplement for the Replacement Portfolio. The Contract prospectus and supplement, and the prospectus and supplement for the Replacement Portfolio will be delivered to purchasers of new Contracts in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
22. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to Contract owners and Participants, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners and Participants will be sent a written notice of the Substitution informing them that the Substitution was carried out and that they may transfer all Contract value or cash value under a Contract in a subaccount invested in the Replacement Portfolio on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their Contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among the variable account options. The notice will also reiterate that (other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent Start Printed Page 39998disruptive transfers and other market timing activity) each Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or, to the extent transfer charges apply to a Contract, to impose any charges on transfers until at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. The Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner and Participant a current prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio if they have not previously received a current version.
23. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed Substitution from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate. The proposed Substitution will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date pursuant to Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's or Participant's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts. The proposed Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Removed Portfolio in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date at their net asset value and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolio at their net asset value on the same date. All in-kind redemptions will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the no-action letter issued by the staff of the Commission to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (pub. avail. Dec. 28, 1999).
24. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants state that Contract owners and Participants will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitution, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Consequently, all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed Substitution, including any brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed Substitution will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners or Participants. The proposed Substitution will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners and Participants to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution; all Contract-level fees will remain the same after the Substitution. In addition, because the Substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts, no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the Substitution.
25. The Section 26 Applicants represent that with respect to those Contract owners or Participants on the date of the Substitution, the Insurance Companies will reimburse the subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolio for a period of two years after the date of the Substitution, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter), such that the sum of the Replacement Portfolio's total operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculations of subaccount unit value) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Removed Portfolio's total operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year 2009.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without Commission approval. Section 26(c) provides that “[t]he Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.”
2. The Section 26 Applicants assert that the proposed Substitution involves a substitution of securities within the meaning of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and therefore request an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) approving the proposed Substitutions.
3. The Section 26 Applicants state they have reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying investment option for one of the current underlying investment options offered as a funding option under the Contracts both to protect themselves and their Contract owners and Participants in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a Separate Account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the Insurance Companies and their respective Contract owners and Participants.
4. The Section 26 Applicants argue that the Removed Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio have identical investment objectives and substantially similar investment policies and risks. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants clarify that the proposed Substitution retains for Contract owners and Participants the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants assert that any impact on the investment programs of affected Contract owners and Participants, including the appropriateness of the available investment options, should therefore be negligible.
5. Furthermore, the Section 26 Applicants claim that the Substitution will permit the Insurance Companies to present information to their Contract owners and Participants in a simpler and more concise manner. It is anticipated that after the Substitution, Contract owners and Participants will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their Contracts.
6. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants point out that as a result of the proposed Substitution, Contract owners and Participants with subaccount balances currently invested in the Removed Portfolio will have a lower total operating expense ratio after the Substitution as Contract owners or Participants with subaccount balances invested in the Replacement Portfolio. In this regard, each Insurance Company has agreed to impose certain expense limits, as discussed earlier in the application, to ensure that Contract owners and Participants do not incur higher expenses as a result of the Substitution for a period of two years after the Substitution.
7. In addition to the foregoing, the Section 26 Applicants generally submit that the proposed Substitution meets the standards that the Commission and its staff have applied to similar substitutions that the Commission previously has approved. The Section 26 Applicants also submit that the proposed Substitution is not of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute investment securities in a manner that permanently affected all the investors in the trust, the Contracts provide each Contract owner or Participant with the right to exercise his or her own judgment, and transfer Contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to Contract owners or Participants under their Contracts. Start Printed Page 39999Additionally, the Section 26 Applicants assert that the proposed Substitution will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options.
8. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners and Participants the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfer and other market timing activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying Contract owners and Participants of the proposed Substitution and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution. The proposed Substitution, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent.
9. The Section 26 Applicants also note that the proposed Substitution is also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a Contract or participating in a group Contract, Contract owners and Participants select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their Contract values; they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the Section 26 Applicants under the applicable Contract, as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the Contract. Contract owners and Participants also may have considered the Insurance Company's size, financial condition, and its reputation for service in selecting their Contract. These factors will not change as a result of the proposed Substitution, nor will the annuity, life or tax benefits afforded under the Contracts held by any of the affected Contract owners or Participants.
10. The Section 17 Applicants request an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in connection with the proposed Substitution.
11. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the same persons, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
12. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, issue an order exempting any proposed transaction from the provisions of Section 17(a) if: (i) the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (ii) the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (iii) the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
13. The Removed Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio may be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another, or affiliated persons of an affiliated person. Shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company. Thus, the Insurance Companies and their affiliates collectively own substantially all of the shares of the Trust. Accordingly, the Trust and its respective Portfolios may be deemed to be under the control of the Insurance Companies notwithstanding the fact that the Contract owners and Participants may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the Separate Accounts. If the Trust is under the common control of the Insurance Companies, then each Insurance Company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the Trust and its respective Portfolios. If the Trust and its respective Portfolios are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then the Trust and its respective affiliates are affiliated persons of the Insurance Companies.
14. Regardless of whether the Insurance Companies can be considered to control the Trust and its Portfolios, the Insurance Companies may be deemed to be affiliated persons of the Trust and its Portfolios, including the Removed Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio, because the Insurance Companies (which are under common control) and their affiliates own of record more than 5% of the outstanding shares. Likewise, each of the Trust's Portfolios may be deemed to be an affiliated person of each Insurance Company. As a result of these relationships, the Removed Portfolio may be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person (the Insurance Companies or the Separate Accounts) of the Replacement Portfolio, and vice versa.
15. The proposed In-Kind Transactions could be seen as the indirect purchase of shares of the Replacement Portfolio with portfolio securities of the Removed Portfolio and the indirect sale of portfolio securities of the Removed Portfolio for shares of the Replacement Portfolio. Pursuant to this analysis, the proposed In-Kind Transactions also could be categorized as a purchase of shares of the Replacement Portfolio by the Removed Portfolio, acting as principal, and a sale of portfolio securities by the Removed Portfolio, acting as principal, to the Replacement Portfolio. In addition, the proposed In-Kind Transactions could be viewed as a purchase of securities from the Removed Portfolio and a sale of securities to the Replacement Portfolio by each Insurance Company (or the Separate Accounts), acting as principal. If categorized in this manner, the proposed In-Kind Transactions may be deemed to contravene Section 17(a) due to the affiliated status of these participants.
16. The Section 17 Applicants assert that the In-Kind Transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of the Removed Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio, as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the registration statement for the Trust and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. The In-Kind Transactions will not change the dollar value of any Contract owner's or Participant's investment in any of the Separate Accounts, the value of any Contract, the accumulation value or other value credited to any Contract, or the death benefit payable under any Contract. Immediately after the proposed In-Kind Transactions, the value of a Separate Account's investment in the Replacement Portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the Removed Portfolio (together with the value of any pre-existing investments in the Replacement Portfolio) immediately before the In-Kind Transactions.
17. Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act exempts from the prohibitions of Section 17(a), subject to certain enumerated conditions, a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies or separate series of registered investment companies, which are affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of affiliated persons, of each other, between separate series of a registered investment company, or between a registered investment company or a separate series of a registered investment company and a person which is an affiliated person of such registered investment company (or affiliated person of such person) solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of Start Printed Page 40000each other, common directors, and/or common officers.
18. However, one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 requires that the transaction be a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are readily available. If the proposed In-Kind Transactions are viewed as purchases and sales of securities, the consideration in the proposed redemptions of shares of the Removed Portfolio and the proposed purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolio would not be cash, but rather, the portfolio securities received from the Removed Portfolio.
19. The Section 17 Applicants will ensure that the Trust will carry out the proposed In-Kind Transactions in conformity with the conditions of Rule 17a-7, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash.
20. For the reasons stated above, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. Furthermore, the Section 17 Applicants represent that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policies of the Removed and corresponding Replacement Portfolios, as recited in their respective current registration statements, and that the proposed In-Kind Transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and do not present any conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent.
Conclusion
For the reasons set forth in the application, the Applicants each respectively request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

PROSPECTUS DATED MAY 1, 2003 

Please read this prospectus and keep it for future reference. It contains       
important information that you should know before purchasing, or taking any     
other action under a policy. Also, prospectuses that contain important          
information about the Portfolios accompany this prospectus.                     

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This prospectus describes many aspects of a Paramount Life(SM) policy, but is   
not itself a policy. The policy is the actual contract that determines your     
benefits and obligations under Paramount Life(SM). To make this prospectus      
easier to read, we sometimes use different words than the policy. Equitable Life
or your financial professional can provide any further explanation about your   
policy.                                                                         

WHAT IS PARAMOUNT LIFE(SM)?                                                     

Paramount Life(SM) is issued by Equitable Life. It provides life insurance      
coverage, plus the opportunity for you to earn a return in our guaranteed       
interest option and/or one or more of the following variable investment options:

Amounts that you allocate under your policy to any of the variable investment   
options are invested in a corresponding "Portfolio" that is part of EQ Advisors 
Trust, AXA Premier VIP Trust, the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund, The Davis   
Variable Account Fund, Inc., the MFS Variable Insurance Trust, the OCC          
Accumulation Trust, the PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust or The Universal         
Institutional Funds, Inc. (the "Trusts"), which are mutual funds. Your          
investment results in a variable investment option will depend on those of the  
related Portfolio. Any gains will generally be tax deferred, and the life       
insurance benefits we pay if the policy's insured person dies will generally be 
income tax free.                                                                

OTHER CHOICES YOU HAVE. You have considerable flexibility to tailor the policy  
to your needs. For example, subject to our rules, you can (1) choose when and   
how much you contribute (as "premiums") to your policy, (2) pay certain premium 
amounts to guarantee that your insurance coverage will continue for five years, 
regardless of investment performance, (3) borrow or withdraw amounts you have   
accumulated, (4) decrease the amount of insurance coverage, (5) choose between  
two life insurance benefit options, (6) elect to receive an insurance benefit if
the insured person becomes terminally ill, and (7) obtain certain optional      
benefits that we offer by "riders" to your policy.                              

Your financial professional can provide you with information about all forms of 
life insurance available from us and help you decide which may best meet your   
needs. Replacing existing insurance with Paramount Life(SM) or another policy   
may not be to your advantage.

"We," "our" and "us" refer to Equitable Life. "Financial professional" means the
registered representative who is offering you this policy.                      

When we address the reader of this prospectus with words such as "you" and      
"your," we mean the person or persons having the right or responsibility that   
the prospectus is discussing at that point. This usually is the policy's owner. 
If a policy has more than one owner, all owners must join in the exercise of any
rights an owner has under the policy, and the word "owner" therefore refers to  
all owners.                                                                     

When we use the word "state," we also mean any other local jurisdiction         
whose laws or regulations affect a policy.

1. Risk/benefit summary: Policy features, benefits and risks                    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paramount Life(SM) is a variable life insurance policy that provides you with   
flexible premium payments and benefits to meet your specific needs. The basic   
terms of the policy require you to make certain payments in return for life     
insurance coverage. The payments you can make and the coverage you can receive  
under this "base policy" are described below.                                   

Riders to your base policy can increase the benefits you receive and affect the 
amounts you pay in certain circumstances. Those riders, including the Incentive 
Term rider are discussed in "Other benefits you can add by rider" under "More   
information about policy features and benefits" later in this prospectus.       

HOW YOU CAN PAY FOR AND CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR POLICY                               

PREMIUM PAYMENTS. We call the amounts you contribute to your policy "premiums"  
or "premium payments." The amount we require as your first premium varies       
depending on the specifics of your policy and the insured person. Each          
subsequent premium payment must be at least $100, although we can increase this 
minimum if we give you advance notice. Otherwise, with a few exceptions         
mentioned below, you can make premium payments at any time and in any amount.   

SECTION 1035 EXCHANGES OF POLICIES WITH OUTSTANDING LOANS. If we approve, you   
may purchase a Paramount Life(SM) policy through an assignment and exchange of  
another life insurance policy with a cash surrender value pursuant to a valid   
Internal Revenue Code Section 1035 exchange. If such other policy is subject to 
a policy loan, we may permit you to carry over all or a portion of such loan to 
the Paramount Life(SM) policy, subject to our administrative rules then in      
effect. In this case, we will treat any cash paid, plus any loaned amount       
carried over to the Paramount Life(SM) policy, as premium received in           
consideration of our issuing the policy. If we allow you to carry over all or a 
portion of any such outstanding loan, then we will hold amounts securing such   
loan in the same manner as the collateral for any other policy loan, and your   
policy also will be subject to all of our other rules regarding loans (see      
"Borrowing from your policy" later in this prospectus).                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can generally pay premiums at such times and in such amounts as you like    
before the policy anniversary nearest to the insured's 100th birthday, so long  
as you don't exceed certain limits determined by the federal income tax laws    
applicable to life insurance.                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LIMITS ON PREMIUM PAYMENTS. The federal tax law definition of "life insurance"  
limits your ability to pay certain high levels of premiums (relative to the     
amount of your policy's insurance coverage). Also, if your premium payments     
exceed certain other amounts specified under the Internal Revenue Code, your    
policy will become a "modified endowment contract," which may subject you to    
additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy. See "Tax  
information" later in this prospectus. We may return any premium payments that  
would exceed those limits to you.                                               

You can ask your financial professional to provide you with an illustration of  
policy benefits that shows you the amount of premium you can pay, based on      
various assumptions, without exceeding these tax law limits. The tax law limits 
can change as a result of certain changes you make to your policy. For example, 
a reduction in the face amount of your policy may reduce the amount of premiums 
that you can pay.                                                               

If at any time when your policy's account value is high enough that the         
alternative death benefit (discussed later in this prospectus) would apply, we  
reserve the right to limit the amount of any premiums that you pay, unless the  
insured person provides us with adequate evidence that he/she continues to meet 
our requirements for issuing insurance.                                         

PLANNED PERIODIC PREMIUMS. Page 3 of your policy will specify a "planned        
periodic premium." This is the amount that you request us to bill you. However, 
payment of these or any other specific amounts of premiums is not mandatory. You
need to pay only the amount of premiums (if any) necessary to keep your policy  
from lapsing and terminating as discussed below.                                

THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF PREMIUMS YOU MUST PAY                                     

POLICY "LAPSE" AND TERMINATION. Your policy will lapse (also referred to in your
policy as "default") if your net account value is not enough to pay your        
policy's monthly charges when due unless:                                       

o   you have paid sufficient premiums to maintain the five year no-lapse        
   guarantee against termination and your policy is still within the period of
the guarantee and you do not have an outstanding loan (see "You can
guarantee that your policy will not terminate before a certain date" below)
or                                                                      

o   you have elected the "paid up" death benefit guarantee and it remains in    
  effect and you do not have an outstanding loan (see "You can elect a "paid
up" death benefit guarantee" below).                                    

("Account value" and "net account value" are explained under "Determining your  
policy's value" later in this prospectus.)                                      

We will mail a notice to you at your last known address if your policy lapses.  
You will have a 61-day grace period to pay at least an amount prescribed in your
policy which would be enough to keep your policy in force for approximately     
three months (without regard to investment performance). You may not make any   
transfers or request any other policy changes during a grace period. If we do   
not receive your payment by the end of the grace period, your policy (and all   
riders to the

policy) will terminate without value and all coverage under your policy will    
cease. We will mail an additional notice to you if your policy terminates.      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your policy will terminate if you don't pay enough premiums (i) to pay the      
charges we deduct or (ii) to maintain in effect the five year no-lapse guarantee
that can keep your policy from terminating. However, we will first send you a   
notice and give you a chance to pay any shortfall.                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may owe taxes if your policy terminates while you have a loan outstanding,  
even though you receive no additional money from your policy at that time. See  
"Tax information," later in this prospectus.                                    

RESTORING A TERMINATED POLICY. To have your policy "restored" (put back in      
force), you must apply within six months after the date of termination. In some 
states, you may have a longer period of time. You must also present evidence of 
insurability satisfactory to us and pay at least the amount of premium that we  
require. The amount of payment will not be more than an amount sufficient to    
cover total monthly deductions for 3 months, calculated from the effective date 
of restoration and the premium charge. We will determine the amount of this     
required payment as if no interest or investment performance were credited to or
charged against your policy account. Your policy contains additional information
about the amount of this premium and about the values and terms of the policy   
after it is restored.                                                           

YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT YOUR POLICY WILL NOT TERMINATE BEFORE A CERTAIN DATE 

You can generally guarantee that your policy will not terminate for five years  
by paying at least certain specified amounts of premium. We call these amounts  
"guarantee premiums" and they will be set forth on page 3 of your policy. (Your 
policy calls this guarantee the "no-lapse guarantee.")                          

In some states, this guarantee may be referred to by a different name.          

We make no extra charge for the no-lapse guarantee. However, in order for this  
guarantee to be effective, you must have satisfied the "guarantee premium test" 
(discussed below) and you must not have any outstanding policy loans.           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In most states, if you pay at least certain prescribed amounts of premiums, and 
have no policy loans, your policy will not terminate for five years, even if the
value in your policy becomes insufficient to pay the monthly charges.           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUARANTEE PREMIUM TEST. If your policy's net account value is not sufficient to 
pay a monthly deduction that has become due, we check to see if the cumulative  
amount of premiums that you have paid to date at least equals the cumulative    
guarantee premiums due to date for the five year no-lapse guarantee. If it does,
your policy will not lapse, provided that you have no policy loans outstanding  
and provided that the period of the guarantee has not expired.                  

When we calculate the cumulative amount of guarantee premiums for the five year 
no-lapse guarantee, we compound each amount at a 4% annual interest rate from   
the due date through the date of the calculation. (This interest rate is only   
for purposes of determining whether you have satisfied the five year no-lapse   
guarantee premium test. It does not bear any relation to the returns you will   
actually earn or any loan interest you will actually pay.) We use the same      
calculation for determining the cumulative amount of premiums paid, beginning   
with the date each premium is received. The amount of premiums you must pay to  
maintain the five year no-lapse guarantee against termination will be increased 
by the cumulative amount of any partial withdrawals you have taken from your    
policy (calculated by the same method, beginning with the date of withdrawal).  

GUARANTEE PREMIUMS. The amount of the premiums for the five year no-lapse       
guarantee is set forth in your policy on a monthly basis. The guarantee premiums
are actuarially determined at policy issuance and depend on the age and other   
insurance risk characteristics of the insured person, as well as the amount of  
the coverage and additional features you select. The guarantee premiums may     
change if, for example, the face amount of the policy or a rider changes, or a  
rider is added or eliminated, or if there is a change in the insured person's   
risk characteristics. We will send you a new policy page showing any change in  
your guarantee premiums. Any change will be prospective only, and no change will
extend the no-lapse guarantee period beyond its original number of years.       

YOU CAN ELECT A "PAID UP" DEATH BENEFIT GUARANTEE                               

You may elect to take advantage of our "paid up" death benefit guarantee at any 
time after the fourth year of your policy if the insured's attained age is 99 or
less. If you elect the paid up death benefit guarantee, we may initially reduce 
your base policy's face amount (see below). Thereafter, your policy will not    
lapse and the death benefit will never be less than the base policy's face      
amount, so long as the guarantee remains in effect. The guarantee will          
terminate, however, if (i) at any time following the election, the sum of any   
outstanding policy loans, accrued interest and any "restricted" amount due to   
exercise of a living benefits rider exceeds your policy's account value or (ii) 
you request us to terminate the election.                                       

In order to elect the paid up death benefit guarantee:                          

o   you must have death benefit "Option A" in effect (see "About your life
insurance benefit" below);                                              

o   you must terminate any riders to your policy that carry additional charges, 
including the Incentive Term rider;                                     

o   the election must not cause the policy to lose its qualification as life    
   insurance under the Internal Revenue Code or require a current distribution
from the policy to avoid such disqualification; and                     

o   the election must not reduce the face amount (see below) to less than the   
minimum face amount for which we would then issue a policy.             

The paid up death benefit guarantee applies only to your base policy's face     
amount, and not to the face amount or other coverage under any riders that (as  
noted above) must be terminated when the guarantee is elected.                  

POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF FACE AMOUNT. The face amount of your policy after this    
guarantee is elected is the lesser of (a) the face amount immediately before the
election or (b) the policy account value divided by a factor based on the then  
age of the insured person. The factors                                          

                    Risk/benefit summary: Policy features, benefits and risks  2

are set forth in your policy. As a general matter, the factors change as the    
insured person ages so that, if your account value stayed the same, the result  
of the calculation under clause (b) above would be lower the longer your policy 
is in force.                                                                    

If electing the paid up death benefit guarantee causes a reduction in face      
amount, we will deduct the same portion of any remaining surrender charge as we 
would have deducted if you had requested that decrease directly (rather than    
electing the paid up death benefit guarantee). See "Charges and expenses you    
will pay" earlier in this prospectus.                                           

OTHER EFFECTS OF THIS GUARANTEE. You generally may continue to pay premiums     
after you have elected the paid up death benefit guarantee (subject to the same 
limits as before), but premium payments are not required. If the election causes
your face amount to decrease, however, the amount of additional premiums you can
pay, if any, may be reduced. You may continue to make transfers, but you may not
change the death benefit option or add riders that have their own charges while 
the paid up death benefit guarantee is in effect.                               

Partial withdrawals while the paid up death benefit guarantee is in effect will 
generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as any other partial      
withdrawal (see "Making withdrawals from your policy" later in this prospectus),
except that:                                                                    

o   We may decline your request for a partial withdrawal (or any other policy   
change) under the circumstances described in the paid up death benefit  
guarantee policy endorsement. If this occurs, you may wish to consider  
asking us to terminate the paid up death benefit guarantee.             

o   Partial withdrawals (and any distributions we may be required to make for   
  tax purposes) will generally reduce your policy's face amount by more than
the amount of the withdrawal.                                           

Election of the paid up death benefit guarantee may cause your policy to become 
a modified endowment contract under certain circumstances. See "Tax treatment of
distributions to you" under "Tax information," later in this prospectus. You    
should consult your tax advisor before making this election.                    

INVESTMENT OPTIONS WITHIN YOUR POLICY                                           

Except as set forth in the next sentence, we will initially put all unloaned    
amounts which you have allocated to variable investment options into such       
options on the later of the business day that we receive the full minimum       
initial premium or the register date (the "Investment Start Date"). In those    
states that require us to return your premium without adjustment for investment 
performance within a certain number of days (see "Your right to cancel within a
certain number of days," later in this prospectus), we will initially put all   
amounts which you have allocated to the variable investment options in our      
EQ/Money Market investment option. In this case, on the first business day      
following the twentieth day after your policy is issued, we will re-allocate    
that investment in accordance with your premium allocation instructions then in 
effect. For policies issued in these states, the "Allocation Date" is the first 
business day following the twentieth day after your policy is issued. For all   
other policies, the Allocation Date is the Investment Start Date. You give such 
allocation instructions in your application to purchase a policy. You can change
the premium allocation percentages at any time, but this will not affect any    
prior allocations. The allocation percentages that you specify must always be in
whole numbers and total exactly 100%.                                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can choose among variable investment options.                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS. The available variable investment options are      
listed on the front cover of this prospectus. (Your policy and other            
supplemental materials may refer to these as "Investment Funds".) The investment
results you will achieve in any one of these options will depend on the         
investment performance of the corresponding Portfolio that shares the same name 
as that option. That Portfolio follows investment practices, policies and       
objectives that are appropriate to the variable investment option you have      
chosen. You can lose your principal when investing in the variable investment   
options. In periods of poor market performance, the net return, after charges   
and expenses, may result in negative yields, including for the EQ/Money Market  
variable investment option.                                                     

The advisors who make the investment decisions for each Portfolio are set forth 
later in the prospectus under "About the Portfolios."                           

You will find other important information about each Portfolio in the separate  
prospectuses for each Trust which accompany this prospectus, including a        
comprehensive discussion of the risks of investing in each Portfolio. We may add
or delete variable investment options or Portfolios at any time.                

Our arrangements with Portfolio sponsors that are not affiliated with us may    
provide that they or one of their affiliates will pay us based on a percentage  
(up to 0.30% on an annual basis) of the net assets of a Portfolio attributable  
to the Policies. These fees are not charged to you, the Separate Account or the 
Portfolio.                                                                      

GUARANTEED INTEREST OPTION. You can also allocate some or all of your policy's  
value to our guaranteed interest option. We, in turn, invest such amounts as    
part of our general assets. Periodically, we declare a fixed rate of interest   
(3% minimum) on amounts that you allocate to our guaranteed interest option. We 
credit and compound the interest daily at an effective annual rate that equals  
the declared rate. The rates we are at any time declaring on outstanding        
policies may differ from the rates we are then declaring for newly issued       
policies. (The guaranteed interest option is part of what your policy and other 
supplemental material may refer to as the "Guaranteed Interest Account.")       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will pay at least 3% annual interest on our guaranteed interest option.      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT 

YOUR POLICY'S FACE AMOUNT. In your application to buy a Paramount Life(SM)      
policy, you tell us how much insurance coverage you want on the life of the     
insured person. We call this the "face amount" of the base policy. $200,000 is  
the smallest amount of coverage you can request.                                

You should consider whether it would be to your advantage to take out some of   
your coverage under our Incentive Term rider. This rider generally provides     
lower current charges and the guaranteed cost of                                

3  Risk/benefit summary: Policy features, benefits and risks                    

P-->485APOS9th Page of 69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 9th
insurance is generally higher under this rider than under the base policy. See  
"The Incentive Term rider" below.                                               

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the insured person dies, we pay a life insurance benefit to the "beneficiary"
you have named. The amount we pay depends on whether you have chosen death      
benefit Option A or death benefit Option B. We also have options available for  
the manner in which we pay death benefits (see "Your options for receiving
policy proceeds" under "More information about policy features and benefits"    
later in this prospectus).                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR POLICY'S "DEATH BENEFIT" OPTIONS. In your policy application, you also     
choose whether the basic amount (or "benefit") we will pay if the insured person
dies is:                                                                        

o   Option A -- THE POLICY'S FACE AMOUNT on the date of the insured person's    
    death. The amount of this death benefit doesn't change over time, unless you
take any action that changes the policy's face amount;                  

or

o   Option B -- THE FACE AMOUNT PLUS THE POLICY'S "ACCOUNT VALUE" on the date of
    death. Under this option, the amount of death benefit generally changes from
    day to day, because many factors (including investment performance, charges,
premium payments and withdrawals) affect your policy's account value.   

Your policy's "account value" is the total amount that at any time is earning   
interest for you or being credited with investment gains and losses under your  
policy. (Account value is discussed in more detail under "Determining your      
policy's value" later in this prospectus.)                                      

Under Option B, your policy's death benefit will tend to be higher than under   
Option A. As a result, the monthly insurance charge we deduct will also be      
higher, to compensate us for our additional risk.                               

ALTERNATIVE HIGHER DEATH BENEFIT IN LIMITED CASES. Your policy is designed to   
always provide a minimum level of insurance protection relative to your policy's
value, in part to meet the Internal Revenue Code's definition of "life          
insurance." For more information on the alternative higher death benefit and for
information on other adjustments to the death benefit, see "More information    
about policy features and benefits" later in this prospectus.                   

THE INCENTIVE TERM RIDER. The Incentive Term rider allows you to purchase       
additional coverage on the insured person when you purchase your base policy.   
The minimum face amount that you may purchase under the Incentive Term rider is 
$100,000 and the maximum amount is equal to 90% of the target amount (which is  
the base policy face amount plus the face amount under the Incentive Term       
rider). Choosing term coverage under this rider in lieu of coverage under your  
base Paramount Life(SM) policy can reduce your current total charges. Our "cost 
of insurance" charges under the Incentive Term rider are generally currently    
lower than they are for coverage under the base policy. On the other hand, the  
guaranteed maximum charges for the Incentive Term rider are generally higher. In
addition, this coverage does not have surrender charges and the per $1,000 of   
face amount administrative charge does not apply to coverage under this rider.  
We reserve the right to raise the insurance rates for this rider at any time so 
that they could exceed the rates for the base policy.                           

If your policy is issued with an Incentive Term rider, the five year no- lapse  
guarantee on the target amount is available; however, the paid up death benefit 
guarantee is only available with respect to the base coverage. In addition, any 
coverage you purchase under the Incentive Term rider will terminate when the    
insured reaches age 100. Coverage under the base policy will continue as long as
the insured is alive and the policy is in force.                                

Except as noted in the next sentence, if you request a face amount decrease (or 
a partial withdrawal that results in a face amount decrease), we will adjust    
your base policy face amount and your Incentive Term rider face amount          
proportionately, so that the ratio between the two remains the same. However, to
the extent that such a reduction of the base policy face amount would cause the 
face amount to fall below the minimum we are then requiring for new policies, we
will make such reduction from the Incentive Term rider face amount only.        

Any change in the death benefit option will not change the Incentive Term       
rider's face amount, unless the alternative death benefit is in effect. If it   
is, any change in your death benefit option will cause your Incentive Term      
rider's face amount to be automatically reduced as discussed below under "Change
of death benefit option."                                                       

When the alternative death benefit becomes applicable, the death benefit under  
the base policy is increased and the death benefit under the Incentive Term     
rider is automatically reduced by the same amount (but not below zero).         

Use of the Incentive Term rider instead of an equal amount of coverage under the
base policy generally reduces commissions. Therefore, an agent may receive a    
higher commission for selling you a policy that does not include the Incentive  
Term rider.                                                                     

See also "Tax information" later in this prospectus for certain possible tax    
consequences of face amount changes or adding or deleting riders.               

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can request a change in your death benefit option any time after the second 
year and before the policy anniversary nearest to the insured's 100th birthday; 
however, changes to option B are not permitted after the insured person reaches 
age 86.                                                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGE OF DEATH BENEFIT OPTION. If you change from Option A to B, we            
automatically reduce your base policy's face amount by an amount equal to your  
policy's account value at the time of the change. We may refuse this change if  
the policy's face amount would be reduced below our then current minimum for new
policies.                                                                       

If you change from Option B to A, we automatically increase your base policy's  
face amount by an amount equal to your policy's account value at the time of the
change.                                                                         

If the alternative death benefit (referenced above) is higher than the base     
policy's death benefit at the time of the change in death benefit option:       

o   we will determine the new base policy face amount somewhat differently from 
the general procedures described above, and                             

o   we will automatically reduce the face amount of any Incentive Term rider    
that you then have in effect (we discuss the Incentive Term rider above 
under "The Incentive Term rider."

We will not deduct or establish any amount of surrender charge as a result of a 
change in death benefit option. Please refer to "Tax information" later in this 
prospectus, to learn about certain possible income tax consequences that may    
result from a change in death benefit option, including the effect of an        
automatic increase or decrease in face amount.                                  

YOU CAN DECREASE YOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE                                        

You may request a decrease in your policy's face amount any time after the      
second year of your policy and before the policy anniversary nearest to the     
insured's 100th birthday. The requested decrease must be at least $10,000.      
Please refer to "Tax information" for certain possible tax consequences of      
decreasing the face amount.                                                     

We can refuse any requested decrease. We will not approve any decrease if we are
at that time being required to waive charges or pay premiums under any optional 
disability waiver rider that is part of the policy.                             

The following additional conditions also apply:                                 

You may not reduce the face amount below the minimum we are then requiring for  
new policies. Nor will we permit a decrease that would cause your policy to fail
the Internal Revenue Code's definition of life insurance. Guarantee premiums, as
well as our monthly deductions for the cost of insurance coverage, will         
generally decrease from the time you reduce the face amount.                    

If you reduce the face amount during the first 10 years of your policy, we will 
deduct all or part of the remaining surrender charge from your policy. Assuming 
you have not previously changed the face amount, the amount of surrender charge 
we will deduct will be determined by dividing the amount of the decrease by the 
initial face amount and multiplying that fraction by the total amount of        
surrender charge that still remains applicable to your policy. We deduct the    
charge from the same investment options as if it were a part of a regular       
monthly deduction under your policy.                                            

In some cases, we may have to make a distribution to you from your policy at the
time we decrease your policy's face amount. This may be necessary in order to   
preserve your policy's status as life insurance under the Internal Revenue Code.
We may also be required to make such a distribution to you in the future on     
account of a prior decrease in face amount. This could have adverse tax         
consequences.                                                                   

RISKS OF INVESTING IN A POLICY                                                  

The policy is unsuitable as a short-term savings vehicle. Some of the principal 
risks of investing in a policy are as follows:                                  

o   If the investment options you choose perform poorly, you could lose some or 
all of the premiums you pay.                                            

o   If the investment options you choose do not make enough money to pay for the
    policy charges, you could have to pay more premiums to keep your policy from
terminating.                                                            

o   We can increase, without your consent, any charge that you currently pay at 
    less than the maximum amount noted in the table below, to the maximum shown.

o   You may have to pay a surrender charge and there may be adverse tax         
consequences if you wish to discontinue some or all of your insurance   
coverage under a policy.                                                

Your policy permits other transactions that also have risks. These and other    
risks and benefits of investing in a policy are discussed in detail throughout  
this prospectus.                                                                

A comprehensive discussion of the risks of each investment option may be found  
in the Trust prospectus for that investment option.

TABLES OF POLICY CHARGES 

For more information about some of these charges, see "Deducting policy charges"
under "More information about policy changes" later in this prospectus. The

(1) Currently, we reduce this charge after an amount equal to ten "target       
   premiums" has been paid. The "target premium" is actuarially determined for
each policy, based on that policy's characteristics.                    

(2) Beginning after your policy's sixth year, this amount declines at a constant
  rate each month until no surrender charge applies to surrenders made after
 the policy's 10th year. The initial amount of surrender charge depends on
each policy's specific characteristics.                                 

(3) No charge, however, will ever apply to a transfer of all of your variable   
investment option amounts to our guaranteed interest option, or to any  
   transfer pursuant to our Dollar Cost Averaging service or Asset Rebalancing
service as discussed later in this prospectus.                          

(4) Not applicable after the insured person reaches age 100.                    

(5) Since these charges vary based on individual characteristics of each        
insured, the charges shown in the table may not be representative of the
  charge that you will pay. Your financial professional can provide you with
more information about these charges as they relate to the insured's    
particular characteristics.                                             

(6) Our amount "at risk" is the difference between the amount of death benefit  
and the value of your policy as of the deduction date.                  

(7) Insured persons who present particular health, occupational or avocational  
risks may be charged other additional charges as specified in their     
policies.                                                               

(8) This charge does not apply to amounts in our guaranteed interest option.    

You also bear your proportionate share of all fees and expenses paid by a       
"Portfolio" that corresponds to any variable investment option you are using:   

This table shows the lowest and highest total operating expenses currently      
charged by any of the Portfolios that you will pay periodically during the time 
that you own the Policy. The fees and expenses are expressed as an annual       
percentage of the Portfolio's daily average net assets. These fees and expenses 
are reflected in the Portfolio's net asset value each day. Therefore, they      
reduce the investment return of the Portfolio and the related variable          
investment option. Actual fees and expenses are likely to fluctuate from year to
year. More detail concerning each Portfolio's fees and expenses is contained in 
the Trust prospectus for that Portfolio.

(1) Equitable Life, the manager of AXA Premier VIP Trust and EQ Advisors Trust, 
has entered into Expense Limitation Agreements with respect to certain  
Portfolios, which are effective through April 30, 2004. Under these     
  agreements Equitable Life has agreed to waive or limit its fees and assume
    other expenses of certain Portfolios, if necessary, in an amount that limits
each affected Portfolio's total Annual Expenses (exclusive of interest, 
taxes, brokerage commissions, capitalized expenditures and extraordinary
expenses) to not more than specified amounts. The MFS Mid Cap Growth    
Portfolio has an expense offset arrangement that reduces the Portfolio's
    custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the Portfolio with
 its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. The Portfolio may enter into
   other similar arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements, which would
also have

   the effect of reducing the Portfolio's expenses. In addition, Massachusetts
Financial Services Company has contractually agreed, subject to         
  reimbursement, to bear the Portfolio's expenses such that "other expenses"
  (after taking into account the expense offset arrangement described above)
    do not exceed 0.15% annually. This contractual fee arrangement will continue
   until at least May 1, 200 , unless changed with the consent of the board of
    trustees which oversees the arrangement. Also, Pacific Investment Management
   Company ("PIMCO") has contractually agreed to reduce total annual portfolio
 operating expenses to the extent they would exceed, due to the payment of
organizational expenses and Trustees' fees, 0.65% of average daily net  
assets. Under the Expense Limitation Agreement, PIMCO may recoup these  
waivers and reimbursements in future periods, not exceeding three years,
    provided total expenses, including such recoupment, do not exceed the annual
    expense limit. Finally Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., which does
business in certain instances as "Van Kampen," is the manager of The    
Universal Institutional Funds, Inc.-U.S. Real Estate Portfolio and has  
voluntarily agreed to reduce its management fee and/or reimburse the    
Portfolio so that total annual operating expenses of the Portfolio      
(exclusive of investment related expenses, such as foreign country tax  
  expense and interest expense on amounts borrowed) are not more than 1.10%.

HOW WE ALLOCATE CHARGES AMONG YOUR INVESTMENT OPTIONS                           

In your application for a policy, you tell us from which investment options you 
want us to take the policy's monthly deductions as they fall due. You can change
these instructions at any time. If we cannot deduct the charge as your most     
current instructions direct, we will allocate the deduction among your          
investment options proportionately to your value in each.                       

CHANGES IN CHARGES                                                              

We reserve the right in the future to (1) make a charge for certain taxes or    
reserves set aside for taxes (see "Our taxes" under "Tax information" later in  
this prospectus) that might be imposed on us; (2) make a charge for the         
operating expenses of our variable investment options (including, without       
limitation, SEC registration fees and related legal counsel fees and auditing   
fees); or (3) change our other current policy charges (in no event will they    
exceed the maximum charges guaranteed in your policy).                          

Any changes that we make in our current charges or charge rates will be on a    
basis that is equitable to all policyholders of a given class, and will be      
determined based on reasonable assumptions as to expenses, mortality, policy and
contract claims, taxes, investment income and lapses. Any changes in charges may
apply to then in-force policies, as well as to new policies.

3. Who is Equitable Life?                                                       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States ("Equitable    
Life"), a New York stock life insurance corporation. We have been doing business
since 1859. Equitable Life is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AXA       
Financial, Inc., the holding company. AXA, a French holding company for an      
international group of insurance and related financial services companies, is   
the sole shareholder of AXA Financial, Inc. Equitable Life is obligated to pay  
all amounts that are promised to be paid under the policies. No company other   
than Equitable Life, however, has any legal responsibility to pay amounts that  
Equitable Life owes under the policies.                                         

AXA Financial, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries managed approximately $   
billion in assets as of December 31, 2002. For more than 100 years Equitable    
Life has been among the largest insurance companies in the United States. We are
licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in all fifty states, the District 
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our home office is       
located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10104.

----------------------------------  
We require that the following types of communications be on specific forms we   
provide for that purpose:                                                       

(1)  request for dollar cost averaging (our automatic transfer service);        

(2)  authorization for telephone transfers by a person who is not both the      
insured person and the owner;                                         

(3)  request for asset rebalancing; and                                         

(4)  designation of new policy owner(s).                                        

We also have specific forms that we recommend you use for the following:        

(a)  policy surrenders;                                                         

(b)  address changes;                                                           

(c)  beneficiary changes;

(e)  changes in allocation percentages for premiums and deductions.             

You can change your allocation percentages and/or transfer among investment     
options (1) by toll-free phone, (2) over the Internet, through EQAccess, or (3) 
by writing our Administrative Office. For more information about transaction    
requests you can make by phone or over the Internet, see "How to Make Transfers"
and "Telephone and EQAccess requests" later in this prospectus.                 

Certain methods of contacting us, such as by telephone or electronically, may be
unavailable or delayed (for example our fax service may not be available at all 
times and/or we may be unavailable due to emergency closing). In addition, the  
level and type of service available may be restricted based on criteria         
established by us.                                                              

We reserve the right to limit access to these services if we determine that you 
are engaged in a disruptive transfer activity, such as "market timing." (See    
"Disruptive transfer activity" in "More information about other matters.")

Except for properly authorized telephone or Internet transactions, any notice or
request that does not use our standard form must be in writing. It must be dated
and signed by you and should also specify your name, the insured person's name  
(if different), your policy number and adequate details about the notice you    
wish to give or other action you wish us to take. We may require you to return  
your policy to us before we make certain policy changes that you may request.   

The proper person to sign forms, notices and requests would normally be the     
owner or any other person that our procedures permit to exercise the right or   
privilege in question. If there are joint owners all must sign. Any irrevocable 
beneficiary or assignee that we have on our records also must sign certain types
of requests.                                                                    

You should send all requests and notices to our Administrative Office at the    
addresses specified above. We will also accept requests and notices by fax at   
the above number, if we believe them to be genuine. We reserve the right,       
however, to require an original signature before acting on any faxed item. You  
must send premium payments after the first one to our Administrative Office at  
the above addresses; except that you should send any premiums for which we have 
billed you to the address on the billing notice.                                

ABOUT OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT FP                                                   

Each variable investment option is a part (or "subaccount") of our Separate     
Account FP. We established Separate Account FP under special provisions of the  
New York Insurance Law. These provisions prevent creditors from any other       
business we conduct from reaching the assets we hold in our variable investment 
options for owners of our variable life insurance policies. We are the legal    
owner of all of the assets in Separate Account FP and may withdraw any amounts  
that exceed our reserves and other liabilities with respect to variable         
investment options under our policies. Income, gains and losses credited to, or 
charged against Separate Account FP reflect its own investment experience and   
not the investment experience of Equitable Life's other assets.                 

Separate Account FP's predecessor was established on April 19, 1985 by our then 
wholly owned subsidiary, Equitable Variable Life Insurance Company. We          
established our Separate Account FP under New York Law on September 21, 1995.   
When Equitable Variable Life Insurance Company merged into Equitable Life, as of
January 1, 1997, our Separate Account FP succeeded to all the assets,           
liabilities and operations of its predecessor.                                  

Separate Account FP is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act 
of 1940 and is classified by that act as a "unit investment trust." The SEC,    
however, does not manage or supervise Equitable Life or Separate Account FP.    

Each subaccount (variable investment option) of Separate Account FP available   
under Paramount Life(SM) invests solely in the applicable class of shares issued
by the corresponding Portfolio of the applicable Trust. Separate Account FP     
immediately reinvests all dividends and other distributions it receives from a  
Portfolio in additional shares of that class in that Portfolio.                 

These Trusts sell their shares to Equitable Life separate accounts in connection
with Equitable Life's variable life insurance and/or annuity products, and to   
separate accounts of insurance companies, both affiliated and unaffiliated with 
Equitable Life. EQ Advisors Trust and AXA VIP Premier Trust also sell their     
shares to the trustee of a qualified plan for Equitable Life. We currently do   
not foresee any disadvantages to our policyowners arising out of these          
arrangements. However, the Board of Trustees or Directors of each Trust intends 
to monitor events to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts that may    
arise and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response. If we  
believe that a Board's response insufficiently protects our policyowners, we    
will see to it that appropriate action is taken to do so.                       

YOUR VOTING PRIVILEGES                                                          

VOTING OF PORTFOLIO SHARES. As the legal owner of any Portfolio shares that     
support a variable investment option, we will attend (and have the right to vote
at) any meeting of shareholders of the Portfolio (or the Trusts). To satisfy    
currently-applicable legal requirements, however, we will give you the          
opportunity to tell us how to vote the number of each Portfolio's shares that   
are attributable to your policy. We will vote shares attributable to policies   
for which we receive no instructions in the same proportion as the instructions 
we do receive from all policies that participate in our Separate Account FP     
(discussed below). With respect to any Portfolio shares that we are entitled to 
vote directly (because we do not hold them in a separate account or because they
are not attributable to policies), we will vote in proportion to the            
instructions we have received from all holders of variable annuity and variable 
life insurance policies who are using that Portfolio.                           

Under current legal requirements, we may disregard the voting instructions we   
receive from policyowners only in certain narrow circumstances prescribed by SEC
regulations. If we do, we will advise you of the reasons in the next annual or  
semiannual report we send to you.                                               

VOTING AS POLICYOWNER. In addition to being able to instruct voting of Portfolio
shares as discussed above, policyowners that use our variable investment options
may in a few instances be called upon to vote on matters that are not the       
subject of a shareholder vote being taken by any Portfolio. If so, you will have
one vote for each $100 of account value in any such option; and we will vote our
interest in Separate Account FP in the same proportion as the instructions we   
receive from holders of Paramount Life(SM) and other policies that Separate     
Account FP supports.                                                            

OTHER EQUITABLE LIFE POLICIES                                                   

We offer a variety of fixed and variable life insurance policies which offer    
policy features, including investment options, that are different from those    
offered by this prospectus. Not every policy is offered through your financial  
professional. You can contact us to find out more about any other Equitable Life
insurance policy.

4. About the Portfolios of the Trusts                                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should note that some Portfolios have objectives and strategies that are    
substantially similar to those of certain trusts that are purchased directly    
rather than under a variable insurance product such as the Paramount Life(SM)   
policy. These Portfolios may even have the same investment managers and/or      
advisers and/or a similar name. However, there are numerous factors that can    
contribute to differences in performance between two investments, particularly  
over short periods of time. Such factors include the timing of stock purchases  
and sales; differences in trust cash flows; and specific strategies employed by 
the Portfolio manager.                                                          

Equitable Life serves as the investment manager of the Portfolios of the EQ     
Advisors Trust and the AXA Premier VIP Trust. The advisers for these Portfolios,
listed in the chart below, are those who make the investment decisions for each 
Portfolio. The chart also indicates the investment manager and adviser for each 
of the other Portfolios.

5. Determining your policy's value                                              

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR ACCOUNT VALUE                                                              

As set forth earlier in this prospectus, we deduct certain charges from each    
premium payment you make. We credit the rest of each premium payment to your    
policy's "account value." You instruct us to allocate your account value to one 
or more of the policy's investment options indicated on the front cover of this 
prospectus.                                                                     

Your "account value" is the total of (i) your amounts in our variable investment
options, (ii) your amounts in our guaranteed interest option other than in      
(iii), and (iii) any amounts that we are holding to secure policy loans that you
have taken (including any interest on those amounts which has not yet been      
allocated to the variable investment options). See "Borrowing from your policy" 
later in this prospectus. Your "net account value" is the total of (i) and (ii) 
above, plus any interest credited on the loaned amounts, minus any interest     
accrued on outstanding loans and minus any "restricted" amounts that we hold in 
the guaranteed interest option as a result of any payment received under a      
living benefits rider. (Your policy and other supplemental material may refer to
the account that holds the amounts in (ii) and (iii) above as our "Guaranteed   
Interest Account.") Your account value is subject to certain charges discussed  
in "Risk/ benefit summary: Charges and expenses you will pay" earlier in this   
prospectus.                                                                     

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your account value will be credited with the same returns as are achieved by the
Portfolios or guaranteed interest option that you select, and is reduced by the 
amount of charges we deduct under the policy.                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR POLICY'S VALUE IN OUR VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS. We invest the account   
value that you have allocated to any variable investment option in shares of the
corresponding Portfolio. Your value in each variable investment option is       
measured by "units."                                                            

The number of your units in any variable investment option does not change,     
absent an event or transaction under your policy that involves moving assets    
into or out of that option. Whenever any amount is withdrawn or otherwise       
deducted from one of your policy's variable investment options, we "redeem"     
(cancel) the number of units that has a value equal to that amount. This can    
happen, for example, when all or a portion of monthly deductions and            
transaction-based charges are allocated to that option, or when loans,          
transfers, withdrawals and surrenders are made from that option. Similarly, you 
"purchase" additional units having the same value as the amount of any premium, 
loan repayment, or transfer that you allocate to that option.                   

The value of each unit will increase or decrease each business day, as though   
you had invested in the corresponding Portfolio's shares directly (and          
reinvested all dividends and distributions from the Portfolio in additional     
Portfolio shares). The units' values will be reduced, however, by the amount of 
the mortality and expense risk charge for that period (see "Table of policy
charges" in "Charges and expenses you will pay" earlier in this prospectus). On 
any day, your value in any variable investment option equals the number of units
credited to your policy under that option, multiplied by that day's value for   
one such unit.                                                                  

YOUR POLICY'S VALUE IN OUR GUARANTEED INTEREST OPTION. Your policy's value in   
our guaranteed interest option includes: (i) any amounts you have specifically  
requested that we allocate to that option and (ii) any "restricted" amounts that
we hold in that option as a result of your election to receive a living benefit.
See "Your option to receive a living benefit" later in this prospectus. We      
credit all of such amounts with interest at rates we declare from time to time. 
We guarantee that these rates will not be less than a 3% effective annual rate. 
The mortality and expense risk charge mentioned earlier in this prospectus does 
not apply to our guaranteed interest option.                                    

Amounts may be allocated to or removed from your policy's value in our          
guaranteed interest option for the same purposes as described earlier in this   
prospectus for the variable investment options. We credit your policy with a    
number of dollars in that option that equals any amount that is being allocated 
to it. Similarly, if amounts are being removed from your guaranteed interest    
option for any reason, we reduce the amount you have credited to that option on 
a dollar-for-dollar basis.

6. Transferring your money among our investment options                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRANSFERS YOU CAN MAKE                                                          

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can transfer among our variable investment options and into our guaranteed  
interest option.                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After your policy's Allocation Date, you can transfer amounts from one          
investment option to another. The total of all transfers you make on the same   
day must be at least $500; except that you may transfer your entire balance in  
an investment option, even if it is less than $500. We also reserve the right to
restrict transfers among variable investment options as described in your       
policy, including limitations on the number, frequency, or dollar amount of     
transfers.                                                                      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transfers out of our guaranteed interest option are more limited.               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OUT OF THE GUARANTEED INTEREST OPTION. We only permit  
you to make one transfer out of our guaranteed interest option during each      
policy year. (No such limit applies to transfers out of our variable investment 
options.) Also, the maximum amount of any transfer from our guaranteed interest 
option in any policy year is the greater of (a) 25% of your then current balance
in that option on the transfer effective date (b) $500, or (c) the amount (if   
any) that you transferred out of the guaranteed interest option during the      
immediately preceding policy year.                                              

We will not accept a request to transfer out of the guaranteed interest option  
unless we receive it within the period beginning 30 days before and ending 60   
days after an anniversary of your policy. If we receive the request within that 
period, the transfer will occur as of that anniversary or, if later, the date we
receive it.                                                                     

DISRUPTIVE TRANSFER ACTIVITY. We reserve the right to limit access to these     
services if we determine that you are engaged in a disruptive transfer activity,
such as "market timing" (see "Disruptive transfer activity" in "More information
about other matters").                                                          

HOW TO MAKE TRANSFERS 

TRANSFERS THROUGH OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE. You may submit a written request   
for a transfer to our Administrative Office.                                    

TELEPHONE TRANSFERS. You can make telephone transfers by following one of two   
procedures:                                                                     

o   if you are both the policy's insured person and its owner, by calling the   
number under "By toll-free phone" in "How to reach us" earlier in this  
prospectus, from a touch tone phone; or                                 

o   whether or not you are both the insured person and owner, by sending us a   
    signed telephone transfer authorization form. Once we have the form on file,
we will provide you with a toll-free telephone number to make transfers.

For more information see "Telephone and EQAccess requests" later in this        
prospectus. We allow only one request for telephone transfers each day (although
that request can cover multiple transfers), and we will not allow you to revoke 
a telephone transfer. If you are unable to reach us by telephone, you should    
send a written transfer request to our Administrative Office.                   

EQACCESS TRANSFERS. You can make transfers over the Internet if you are the     
owner of the policy. You may do this by visiting our Web site and enrolling in  
EQAccess. This service may not always be available. Generally, the above        
described restrictions relating to telephone transfers also apply to EQAccess   
transfers.                                                                      

OUR DOLLAR COST AVERAGING SERVICE                                               

We offer a dollar cost averaging service. This service allows you to gradually  
allocate amounts to the variable investment options by periodically transferring
approximately the same dollar amount to the variable investment options you     
select. This will cause you to purchase more units if the unit's value is low,  
and fewer units if the unit's value is high. Therefore, you may achieve a lower 
average cost per unit over the long term.                                       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the dollar cost averaging service does not guarantee that you will earn a 
profit or be protected against losses.                                          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our dollar cost averaging service (also referred to as our "automatic transfer  
service") enables you to make automatic monthly transfers from the EQ/Money     
Market option to our other variable investment options. You may elect the dollar
cost averaging service with your policy application or at any later time        
(provided you are not using the asset rebalancing service described below). At  
least $5,000 must be allocated to the EQ/Money Market option to begin using the 
dollar cost averaging service. You can choose up to eight other variable        
investment options to receive the automatic transfers, but each transfer to each
option must be at least $50.                                                    

This service terminates when the EQ/Money Market option is depleted. You can    
also cancel the dollar cost averaging service at any time. You may not          
simultaneously participate in the asset rebalancing service and the dollar cost 
averaging service.                                                              

OUR ASSET REBALANCING SERVICE                                                   

You may wish us to periodically redistribute the amounts you have in our        
variable investment options so that the relative amount of your account value in
each variable option is restored to an asset allocation that you select. You can
accomplish this automatically through our asset rebalancing service. The        
rebalancing may be at quarterly, semiannual, or annual intervals.               

You may specify asset allocation percentages for up to eight variable investment
options. The allocation percentage you specify for each variable investment     
option selected must be at least 5% (whole percentages only) of the total value 
you hold under the variable investment options, and the sum of the percentages  
must equal 100%. You may not simultaneously participate in the asset rebalancing
service and the dollar cost averaging service (discussed above).

You may request the asset rebalancing service in your policy application or at  
any later time. You may change your allocation instructions or discontinue      
participation in the asset rebalancing service at any time.

7. ACCESSING YOUR MONEY                                                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BORROWING FROM YOUR POLICY 

You may borrow up to 90% of the difference between your policy's account value  
and any surrender charges that are in effect under your policy. (In your policy,
this "difference" is referred to as your Cash Surrender Value.) However, the    
amount you can borrow will be reduced by any amount that we hold on a           
"restricted" basis following your receipt of a living benefits payment, as well 
as by any other loans (and accrued loan interest) you have outstanding. See     
"Your option to receive a living benefit" below.                                

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use policy loans to obtain funds from your policy without surrender     
charges or, in most cases, paying current income taxes. However, the borrowed   
amount is no longer credited with the investment results of any of our          
investment options under the policy.                                            
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you take a policy loan, we remove an amount equal to the loan from one or  
more of your investment options and hold it as collateral for the loan's        
repayment. We hold this loan collateral under the same terms and conditions as  
apply to amounts supporting our guaranteed interest option, with several        
exceptions:                                                                     

o   you cannot make transfers or withdrawals of the collateral;                 

o   we expect to credit different rates of interest to loan collateral than we  
credit under our guaranteed interest option;                            

o   we do not count the collateral when we compute our customer loyalty credit; 
and                                                                     

o   the collateral is not available to pay policy charges.                      

When you request your loan, you should tell us how much of the loan collateral  
you wish to have taken from any amounts you have in each of our investment      
options. If you do not give us directions (or if we are making the loan         
automatically to cover unpaid loan interest), we will take the loan from your   
investment options in the same proportion as we are then taking monthly         
deductions for charges. If that is not possible, we will take the loan from your
investment options in proportion to your value in each.                         

LOAN INTEREST WE CHARGE. The interest we charge on a policy loan accrues daily  
at an adjustable interest rate. We determine the rate at the beginning of each  
year of your policy and that rate applies to all policy loans that are          
outstanding at any time during the year. The maximum rate is the greater of (a) 
4% or (b) the "Monthly Average Corporate" yield published in Moody's Corporate  
Bond Yield Averages for the month that ends two months before the interest rate 
is set. (If that average is no longer published, we will use another average, as
the policy provides.) We will notify you of the current loan interest rate when 
you apply for a loan, and will notify you in advance of any rate increase.      

Loan interest payments are due on each policy anniversary. If not paid when due,
we automatically add the interest as a new policy loan.                         

INTEREST THAT WE CREDIT ON LOAN COLLATERAL. Under our current rules, the annual 
interest rate we credit on your loan collateral during any of your policy's     
first fifteen years will be 1% less than the rate we are then charging you for  
policy loan interest, and, beginning in the policy's 16th year, equal to the    
loan interest rate. The elimination of the rate differential is not guaranteed, 
however. Accordingly, we have discretion to increase the rate differential for  
any period, including under policies that are already in force (and may have    
outstanding loans). We do guarantee that the annual rate of interest credited on
your loan collateral will never be less than 3% and that the differential will  
not exceed 2% (except if tax law changes increase the taxes we pay on policy    
loans or loan interest). Because we first offered Paramount Life(SM) policies in
2002 the interest rate differential has not yet been eliminated under any       
in-force policies.                                                              

We credit interest on your loan collateral daily. On each anniversary of your   
policy (or when your policy loans are fully repaid) we transfer that interest to
your policy's investment options in the same proportions as if it were a premium
payment.                                                                        

EFFECTS OF POLICY LOANS. A loan can reduce the length of time that your         
insurance remains in force, because the amount we set aside as loan collateral  
cannot be used to pay charges as they become due. A loan can also cause any paid
up guaranteed death benefit to terminate or the five year no-lapse guarantee to 
become unavailable. We will deduct any outstanding policy loan plus accrued loan
interest from your policy's proceeds if you do not pay it back. Even if a loan  
is not taxable when made, it may later become taxable, for example, upon        
termination or surrender. See "Tax information" below for a discussion of the   
tax consequences of policy loans.                                               

PAYING OFF YOUR LOAN. You can repay all or part of your loan at any time. We    
normally assume that payments you send us are premium payments. Therefore, you  
must submit instructions with your payment indicating that it is a loan         
repayment. If you send us more than all of the loan principal and interest you  
owe, we will treat the excess as a premium payment.                             

When you send us a loan repayment, we will transfer an amount equal to such     
repayment from your loan collateral back to the investment options under your   
policy. First we will restore any amounts that, before being designated as loan 
collateral, had been in the guaranteed interest option under your policy. We    
will allocate any additional repayments among investment options as you         
instruct; or, if you don't instruct us, in the same proportion as if they were  
premium payments.                                                               

MAKING WITHDRAWALS FROM YOUR POLICY 

You may make a partial withdrawal of your net cash surrender value (defined     
below) at any time after the first year of your policy and before the policy    
anniversary nearest to the insured's 100th birthday. The request must be for at 
least $500, however, and we have discretion to decline any request. If you do   
not tell us from which investment options you wish us to take the withdrawal, we
will use the same allo-

P-->485APOS22nd Page of 69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 22nd
cation that then applies for the monthly deductions we make for charges; and, if
that is not possible, we will take the withdrawal from all of your investment   
options in proportion to your value in each.                                    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can withdraw all or part of your policy's net cash surrender value, although
you may incur tax consequences by doing so.                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EFFECT OF PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS ON INSURANCE COVERAGE. If the Option A death      
benefit is in effect, a partial withdrawal results in a dollar-for-dollar       
automatic reduction in the policy's face amount (and, hence, an equal reduction 
in the Option A death benefit). If the paid up death benefit guarantee is in    
effect, a partial withdrawal will generally reduce the face amount by more than 
the amount of the withdrawal. Face amount reductions that occur automatically as
a result of withdrawals, however, do not result in our deducting any portion of 
any then remaining surrender charge. We will not permit a partial withdrawal    
that would reduce the face amount below our minimum for new policy issuances at 
the time, or that would cause the policy to no longer be treated as life        
insurance for federal income tax purposes.                                      

If death benefit Option B is in effect, a partial withdrawal reduces the death  
benefit on a dollar for dollar basis, but does not affect the face amount.      

The result is different, however, during any time when the alternative death    
benefit (discussed earlier in this prospectus) would be higher than the Option A
or B death benefit you have selected. In that case, a partial withdrawal will   
cause the death benefit to decrease by more than the amount of the withdrawal,  
even if the paid up death benefit guarantee is not then in effect. A partial    
withdrawal reduces the amount of your premium payments that counts toward       
maintaining your policy's no-lapse guarantee, as well. A partial withdrawal may 
increase the chance that your policy could lapse because of insufficient value  
to pay policy charges as they fall due, or it could result in the five year     
no-lapse guarantee not being in effect.                                         

You should refer to "Tax information" below, for information about possible tax 
consequences of partial withdrawals and any associated reduction in policy      
benefits.                                                                       

SURRENDERING YOUR POLICY FOR ITS NET CASH SURRENDER VALUE                       

You can surrender (give us back) your policy for its "net cash surrender value" 
at any time. The net cash surrender value equals your account value, minus any  
outstanding loans and unpaid loan interest, minus any amount of your account    
value that is "restricted" as a result of previously distributed "living        
benefits," and minus any surrender charge that then remains applicable. The     
surrender charge is described in "Charges and expenses you will pay" earlier in 
this prospectus.                                                                

Please refer to "Tax information" below for the possible tax consequences of    
surrendering your policy, and applicable waivers of surrender charges in the    
event of federal estate tax repeal.                                             

YOUR OPTION TO RECEIVE A LIVING BENEFIT 

Subject to our insurance underwriting guidelines and availability in your state,
your policy will automatically include our living benefits rider. This feature  
enables you to receive a portion (generally 75%) of the policy's death benefit  
(excluding death benefits payable under certain other policy riders), if the    
insured person has a terminal illness (as defined in the rider).                

We make no additional charge for the rider. However, if you tell us that you do 
not wish to have the living benefits rider added at issue, but you later ask to 
add it, we will need to evaluate the insurance risk at that time, and we may    
decline to issue the rider.                                                     

If you receive a living benefit, the remaining benefits under your policy will  
be affected. We will deduct the amount of any living benefit we have paid, plus 
interest (as specified in the rider), from the death benefit proceeds that      
become payable under the policy if and when the insured person dies. (In your   
policy, we refer to this as a "lien" we establish against your policy.)         

When we pay a living benefit we automatically transfer a pro rata portion of    
your policy's net cash surrender value to the policy's guaranteed interest      
option. This amount, together with the interest we charge thereon, will be      
"restricted"-- that is, it will not be available for any loans, transfers or    
partial withdrawals that you may wish to make. In addition, it may not be used  
to satisfy the charges we deduct from your policy's value. We will deduct these 
restricted amounts from any subsequent surrender proceeds that we pay.          

The receipt of a living benefits payment may qualify for exclusion from income  
tax. See "Tax information" below. Receipt of a living benefits payment may      
affect your eligibility for certain government benefits or entitlements.        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can arrange to receive a "living benefit" if the insured person becomes     
terminally ill.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This discussion is based on current federal income tax law and interpretations. 
It assumes that the policyowner is a natural person who is a U.S. citizen and   
resident. The tax effects on corporate taxpayers, non-U.S. residents or         
non-U.S. citizens may be different. This discussion is general in nature, and   
should not be considered tax advice, for which you should consult a qualified   
tax advisor.                                                                    

BASIC TAX TREATMENT FOR YOU AND YOUR BENEFICIARY                                

A Paramount Life(SM) policy will be treated as "life insurance" for federal     
income tax purposes (a) if it meets the definition of life insurance under      
Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and (b) as long as the   
investments made by the underlying Portfolios satisfy certain investment        
diversification requirements under Section 817(h) of the Code. We believe that  
the policies will meet these requirements and, therefore, that:                 

o   the death benefit received by the beneficiary under your policy generally   
will not be subject to federal income tax; and                          

o   increases in your policy's account value as a result of interest or         
   investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax, unless and
until there is a distribution from your policy, such as a surrender, a  
partial withdrawal, loan or a payment to you.                           

There may be different tax consequences if you assign your policy or designate a
new owner. See "Assigning your policy" later in this prospectus.                

TAX TREATMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS TO YOU 

The federal income tax consequences of a distribution from your policy depend on
whether your policy is a "modified endowment contract" (sometimes also referred 
to as an "MEC"). In all cases, however, the character of any income described   
below as being taxable to the recipient will be ordinary income (as opposed to  
capital gain).                                                                  

TESTING FOR MODIFIED ENDOWMENT CONTRACT STATUS. Your policy will be a "modified 
endowment contract" if, at any time during the first seven years of your policy,
you have paid a cumulative amount of premiums that exceeds the cumulative       
seven-pay limit. The cumulative seven-pay limit is the amount of premiums that  
you would have paid by that time under a similar fixed-benefit insurance policy 
that was designed (based on certain assumptions mandated under the Code) to     
provide for paid up future benefits after the payment of seven equal annual     
premiums. ("Paid up" means that no future premiums would be required.) This is  
called the "seven-pay" test.                                                    

Whenever there is a "material change" under a policy, the policy will generally 
be (a) treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the policy 
is a modified endowment contract and (b) subjected to a new seven-pay period and
a new seven-pay limit. The new seven-pay limit would be determined taking into  
account, under a prescribed formula, the account value of the policy at the time
of such change. A materially changed policy would be considered a modified      
endowment contract if it failed to satisfy the new seven-pay limit at any time  
during the new seven-pay period. A "material change" for these purposes could   
occur as a result of a change in death benefit option, the selection of         
additional rider benefits or certain other changes.                             

If your policy's benefits are reduced during its first seven years (or within   
seven years after a material change), the seven-pay limit will be redetermined  
based on the reduced level of benefits and applied retroactively for purposes of
the seven-pay test. (Such a reduction in benefits could include, for example, a 
requested decrease in face amount, the termination of additional benefits under 
a rider or, in some cases, a partial withdrawal.) If the premiums previously    
paid are greater than the recalculated (lower) seven-pay limit, the policy will 
become a modified endowment contract.                                           

A life insurance policy that you receive in exchange for a modified endowment   
contract will also be considered a modified endowment contract.                 

In addition to the above premium limits for testing for modified endowment      
status, there are overall limits on the amount of premiums you may pay under    
your policy in order for it to qualify as life insurance. Changes made to your  
policy, for example, a decrease in face amount (including any decrease that may 
occur as a result of a partial withdrawal) or other decrease in benefits may    
impact the maximum amount of premiums that can be paid, as well as the maximum  
amount of account value that may be maintained under the policy. In some cases, 
this may cause us to take current or future action in order to assure that your 
policy continues to qualify as life insurance, including distribution of amounts
to you that may be includible as income. See "Changes we can make" later in this
prospectus.                                                                     

TAXATION OF PRE-DEATH DISTRIBUTIONS IF YOUR POLICY IS NOT A MODIFIED ENDOWMENT  
CONTRACT. As long as your policy remains in force as a non-modified endowment   
contract, policy loans will be treated as indebtedness, and no part of the loan 
proceeds will be subject to current federal income tax. Interest on the loan    
will generally not be tax deductible, although interest credited on loan        
collateral may become taxable under the rules below if distributed.             

If you make a partial withdrawal after the first 15 years of your policy, the   
proceeds will not be subject to federal income tax except to the extent such    
proceeds exceed your "basis" in your policy. (Your basis generally will equal   
the premiums you have paid, less the amount of any previous distributions from  
your policy that were not taxable.) During the first 15 years, however, the     
proceeds from a partial withdrawal could be subject to federal income tax, under
a complex formula, to the extent that your account value exceeds your basis.    

Upon full surrender, any amount by which the proceeds we pay (including amounts 
we use to discharge any policy loan and unpaid loan interest) exceed your basis 
in the policy will be subject to federal

income tax. IN ADDITION, IF A POLICY TERMINATES AFTER A GRACE PERIOD, THE       
EXTINGUISHMENT OF ANY THEN-OUTSTANDING POLICY LOAN AND UNPAID LOAN INTEREST WILL
BE TREATED AS A DISTRIBUTION AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO TAX UNDER THE FOREGOING    
RULES. Finally, if you make an assignment of rights or benefits under your      
policy, you may be deemed to have received a distribution from your policy, all 
or part of which may be taxable.                                                

TAXATION OF PRE-DEATH DISTRIBUTIONS IF YOUR POLICY IS A MODIFIED ENDOWMENT      
CONTRACT. Any distribution from your policy will be taxed on an "income-first"  
basis if your policy is a modified endowment contract. Distributions for this   
purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay        
interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or  
withdrawal. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to  
the extent your account value exceeds your basis in the policy. (For modified   
endowment contracts, your basis is similar to the basis described above for     
other policies, except that it also would be increased by the amount of any     
prior loan under your policy that was considered taxable income to you.)        

For purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distribution, all        
modified endowment contracts issued by Equitable Life (or its affiliate) to the 
same owner (excluding certain qualified plans) during any calendar year are     
treated as if they were a single contract.                                      

A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most distributions  
from a policy that is a modified endowment contract. The penalty tax will not,  
however, apply to (i) taxpayers whose actual age is at least 59 1/2, (ii)       
distributions in the case of a disability (as defined in the Code) or (iii)     
distributions received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic      
annuity payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer or the joint 
lives (or joint life expectancies) of the taxpayer and his or her beneficiary.  

IF YOUR POLICY TERMINATES AFTER A GRACE PERIOD, THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF ANY THEN  
OUTSTANDING POLICY LOAN AND UNPAID LOAN INTEREST WILL BE TREATED AS A           
DISTRIBUTION (to the extent the loan was not previously treated as such) and    
could be subject to tax, including the 10% penalty tax, as described above. In  
addition, upon a full surrender, any excess of the proceeds we pay (including   
any amounts we use to discharge any loan) over your basis in the policy, will be
subject to federal income tax and, unless an exception applies, the 10% penalty 
tax.                                                                            

Distributions that occur during a year of your policy in which it becomes a     
modified endowment contract, and during any subsequent years, will be taxed as  
described in the four preceding paragraphs. In addition, distributions from a   
policy within two years before it becomes a modified endowment contract also    
will be subject to tax in this manner. This means that a distribution made from 
a policy that is not a modified endowment contract could later become taxable as
a distribution from a modified endowment contract.                              

RESTORATION OF A TERMINATED POLICY. For tax purposes, some restorations of a    
policy that terminated after a grace period may be treated as the purchase of a 
new policy.                                                                     

TAX TREATMENT OF LIVING BENEFITS PROCEEDS                                       

Amounts received under an insurance policy on the life of an individual who is  
terminally ill, as defined by the tax law, are generally excludable from the    
payee's gross income. We believe that the benefits provided under our living    
benefits rider meet the tax law's definition of terminally ill and can qualify  
for this income tax exclusion. This exclusion does not apply to amounts paid to 
someone other than the insured person, however, if the payee has an insurable   
interest in the insured person's life only because the insured person is a      
director, officer or employee of the payee or by reason of the insured person   
being financially interested in any trade or business carried on by the payee.  

EFFECT OF POLICY ON INTEREST DEDUCTIONS TAKEN BY BUSINESS ENTITIES              

Ownership of a policy by a trade or business entity can limit the amount of any 
interest on business borrowings that entity otherwise could deduct for federal  
income tax purposes, even though such business borrowings may be unrelated to   
the policy. To avoid the limit, the insured person must be an officer, director,
employee or 20% owner of the trade or business entity when coverage on that     
person commences.                                                               

The limit does not generally apply for policies owned by natural persons (even  
if those persons are conducting a trade or business as sole proprietorships),   
unless a trade or business entity that is not a sole proprietorship is a direct 
or indirect beneficiary under the policy. Entities commonly have such a         
beneficial interest, for example, in so-called "split dollar" arrangements. If  
the trade or business entity has such an interest in a policy, it will be       
treated the same as if it owned the policy for purposes of the limit on         
deducting interest on unrelated business income.                                

The limit generally applies only to policies issued after June 8, 1997 in       
taxable years ending after such date. However, for this purpose, any material   
increase in face amount or other material change in a policy will be treated as 
the issuance of a new policy.                                                   

In cases where the above-discussed limit on deductibility applies, the          
non-deductible portion of unrelated interest on business loans is determined by 
multiplying the total amount of such interest by a fraction. The numerator of   
the fraction is the policy's average account value (excluding amounts we are    
holding to secure any policy loans) for the year in question, and the           
denominator is the average for the year of the aggregate tax bases of all the   
entity's other assets.                                                          

Any corporate, trade, or business use of a policy should be carefully reviewed  
by your tax advisor with attention to these rules, as well as the other rules   
and possible pending legislative proposals which might further restrict         
available exceptions to this limit on interest deductions or make other tax law 
changes with respect to such coverage.                                          

REQUIREMENT THAT WE DIVERSIFY INVESTMENTS                                       

Under Section 817(h) of the Code, the Treasury Department has issued regulations
that implement investment diversification requirements. Failure to comply with  
these regulations would disqualify your policy as a life insurance policy under 
Section 7702 of the Code. If this were to occur, you would be subject to federal
income tax on any income                                                        

19  Tax information

and gains under the policy and the death benefit proceeds would lose their      
income tax-free status. These consequences would continue for the period of the 
disqualification and for subsequent periods. Through the Portfolios, we intend  
to comply with the applicable diversification requirements.                     

ESTATE, GIFT, AND GENERATION-SKIPPING TAXES                                     

If the policy's owner is the insured person, the death benefit will generally be
includable in the owner's estate for purposes of federal estate tax. If the     
owner is not the insured person, and the owner dies before the insured person,  
the value of the policy would be includable in the owner's estate. If the owner 
is neither the insured person nor the beneficiary, the owner will be considered 
to have made a gift to the beneficiary of the death benefit proceeds when they  
become payable.                                                                 

In general, a person will not owe estate or gift taxes until gifts made by such 
person, plus that person's taxable estate, total at least $1 million. (For      
estate tax purposes only, this amount is scheduled to rise at periodic intervals
to $3.5 million in 2009. For year 2010, the estate tax is scheduled to be       
repealed. For years 2011 and thereafter the estate tax is reinstated and the    
gift and estate tax exemption referred to above would again be $1 million.) For 
this purpose, however, certain amounts may be deductible or excludable, such as 
gifts and bequests to the person's spouse or charitable institutions and certain
gifts of $11,000 (previously, the amount was $10,000) or less per year for each 
recipient.                                                                      

As a general rule, if you make a "transfer" to a person two or more generations 
younger than you, a generation-skipping tax may be payable. Generation-skipping 
transactions would include, for example, a case where a grandparent "skips" his 
or her children and names his or her grandchildren as a policy's beneficiaries. 
In that case, the generation-skipping "transfer" would be deemed to occur when  
the insurance proceeds are paid. The generation-skipping tax rates are similar  
to the maximum estate tax rate in effect at the time. Individuals, however, are 
generally allowed an aggregate generation-skipping tax exemption of $1 million  
(indexed annually for inflation, e.g., $    for 2003). Beginning in year 2004,  
this exemption will be the same as the amounts discussed above for estate taxes,
including a full repeal in year 2010, then return to current law in years 2011  
and thereafter. Beginning in 2011, at any time during which there is no federal 
estate tax in effect, we will waive any surrender charges that would otherwise  
apply.                                                                          

The particular situation of each policyowner, insured person or beneficiary will
determine how ownership or receipt of policy proceeds will be treated for       
purposes of federal estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes, as well as state
and local estate, inheritance and other taxes. Because these rules are complex, 
you should consult with a qualified tax adviser for specific information,       
especially where benefits are passing to younger generations.                   

If this policy is being purchased pursuant to a split-dollar arrangement you    
should also consult your tax advisor for advice concerning the effect of IRS    
Notice 2002-8 and recent proposed regulations regarding split-dollar            
arrangements on your split-dollar arrangement. The transition and grandfathering
rules, among other items, should be carefully reviewed.                         

PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING PLANS                                                

There are special limits on the amount of insurance that may be purchased by a  
trust or other entity that forms part of a pension or profit-sharing plan       
qualified under Section 401(a) or 403 of the Code. In addition, the federal     
income tax consequences will be different from those described in this          
prospectus. These rules are complex, and you should consult a qualified tax     
advisor.                                                                        

OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS                                                 

Complex rules may also apply when a policy is held by an employer or a trust, or
acquired by an employee, in connection with the provision of other employee     
benefits. Employees may have imputed income for the value of any economic       
benefit provided by the employer. There may be other tax implications, as well. 
Among other issues, these policyowners must consider whether the policy was     
applied for by or issued to a person having an insurable interest under         
applicable state law and with the insured person's consent. The lack of an      
insurable interest or consent may, among other things, affect the qualification 
of the policy as life insurance for federal income tax purposes and the right of
the beneficiary to receive a death benefit. In early 2002, the IRS issued a     
Notice and opening of a regulations project concerning the taxation of          
split-dollar life insurance arrangements. Proposed regulations have been issued 
which provide new proposed and interim guidance on such arrangements. Transition
and grandfathering rules, among other items, should be carefully reviewed when  
considering such arrangements. In addition, public corporations (generally      
publicly traded or publicly reporting companies) and their subsidiaries should  
consider the possible implications on split-dollar arrangements of recent       
amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which generally prohibit      
certain direct or indirect loans to executive officers or directors. At least   
some split dollar arrangements could be deemed to involve loans within the      
purview of that section.

OUR TAXES 

The operations of our Separate Account FP are reported in our federal income tax
return. The separate account's investment income and capital gains, however,    
are, for tax purposes, reflected in our variable life insurance policy reserves.
Therefore, we currently pay no taxes on such income and gains and impose no     
charge for such taxes. We reserve the right to impose a charge in the future for
taxes incurred; for example, a charge to the separate account for income taxes  
incurred by us that are allocable to the policies.                              

If our state, local or other tax expenses increase, we may add or increase our  
charges for such taxes when they are attributable to Separate Account FP, based 
on premiums, or otherwise allocable to the policies.

WHEN WE WITHHOLD TAXES FROM DISTRIBUTIONS                                       

Generally, unless you provide us with a satisfactory written election to the    
contrary prior to the distribution, we are required to withhold income tax from 
any proceeds we distribute as part of a taxable transaction under your policy.  
If you do not wish us to withhold tax from the payment, or if we do not withhold
enough, you may have to pay later, and you may incur penalties under the        
estimated income tax rules. In some cases, where generation skipping taxes may  
apply, we may also be required to withhold for such taxes unless we are provided
satisfactory notification that no such taxes are due. States may also require us
to withhold tax on distributions to you. Special withholding rules apply if you 
are not a U.S. resident or not a U.S. citizen.                                  

POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE TAX CHANGES AND OTHER TAX INFORMATION                     

The U.S. Congress frequently considers legislation that, if enacted, could      
change the tax treatment of life insurance policies or increase the taxes we pay
in connection with such policies. In addition, the Treasury Department may amend
existing regulations, issue regulations on the qualification of life insurance  
and modified endowment contracts, or adopt new or clarifying interpretations of 
existing law.                                                                   

State and local tax law or, if you are not a U.S. citizen and resident, foreign 
tax law, may also affect the tax consequences to you, the insured person or your
beneficiary, and are subject to change or change in interpretation. Any changes 
in federal, state, local or foreign tax law or interpretations could have a     
retroactive effect both on our taxes and on the way your policy is taxed.       

You may make transfers among Portfolios of the separate account, but you may not
direct the investments each Portfolio makes. If the IRS were to conclude that   
you, as the investor, have control over these investments, then the policy would
no longer qualify as life insurance. You would be treated as the owner of       
separate account assets and be currently taxed on any taxable income or gain the
assets generate.                                                                

The IRS has provided some guidance on this question of investor control, but    
many issues remain unclear. One such issue is whether a policyowner can have too
much investor control if the variable life policy offers a large number of      
investment options in which to invest account values and/or the ability to make 
frequent transfers under the policy. Although the Treasury Department announced 
several years ago that it would provide formal guidance on this issue, it had   
not done so as of the date of this prospectus. We do not know if the IRS will   
provide any further guidance on the issue. If guidance is provided, we do not   
know if it would apply retroactively to policies already in force.              

We believe that our variable life policies do not give policyowners investment  
control over the investments underlying the various investment options; however,
the IRS could disagree with our position. The IRS could seek to treat           
policyowners with a large number of investment options and/or the ability to    
freely transfer among investment options as the owners of the underlying        
Portfolio's shares. Accordingly, we reserve the right to modify your policy as  
necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered the owner of your     
policy's proportionate share of the assets of the separate account.

9. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT POLICY FEATURES AND BENEFITS                          

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALTERNATIVE HIGHER DEATH BENEFIT IN CERTAIN CASES                               

The basic Option A and Option B death benefits are described under "About yout  
life insurance benefit" in "Risk/benefit summary: Policy features, benefits and 
risks" earlier in this prospectus.                                              

We will automatically pay an alternative death benefit if it is HIGHER than the 
basic Option A or Option B death benefit you have selected. This alternative    
death benefit is computed by multiplying your policy's account value on the     
insured person's date of death by a percentage specified in your policy. The    
percentage depends on the insured person's age. Representative percentages are  
as follows:                                                                     

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the value in your policy is high enough, relative to the face amount, the    
life insurance benefit will automatically be greater than the Option A or Option
B death benefit you have selected.                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                [Download Table]

* For the then-current policy year.                                             

This higher alternative death benefit exposes us to greater insurance risk than 
the regular Option A and B death benefits. Because the cost of insurance charges
we make under your policy are based in part on the amount of our risk, you will 
pay more cost of insurance charges for any periods during which the higher      
alternative death benefit is the operative one.                                 

OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO DEATH BENEFIT. We will increase the death benefit proceeds 
by the amount of any other benefits we owe upon the insured person's death under
any optional riders which are in effect.                                        

We will reduce the death benefit proceeds by the amount of any outstanding      
policy loans and unpaid loan interest, as well as any amount of monthly charges 
under the policy that remain unpaid because the insured person died during a    
grace period. We also reduce the death benefit if we have already paid part of  
it under a living benefits rider. We reduce it by the amount of the living      
benefits payment plus interest. See "Your option to receive a living benefit"   
earlier in this prospectus.                                                     

OTHER BENEFITS YOU CAN ADD BY RIDER 

You may be eligible for the following other optional benefits we currently make 
available by rider:                                                             

o   term insurance on the insured person (Incentive Term rider)                 

o   disability waiver of deduction benefit                                      

We add the following riders automatically at no charge to each eligible policy: 

o   living benefits rider                                                       

o   waiver of surrender charge due to tax law change rider (for certain future  
federal estate tax repeal situations)                                   

o   substitution of insured person rider                                        

o   The Incentive Term rider                                                    

Equitable Life or your financial professional can provide you with more         
information about these riders. Some of these riders may only be selected at    
issue or may not be available in your state. Some benefits are not available in 
combination with others. The riders provide additional information, and we will 
furnish samples of them to you on request. The maximum amount of any charge we  
make for a rider will be set forth in the rider or in the policy itself. We can,
however, add, delete, or modify the riders we are making available, at any time 
before they become effective as part of your policy.                            

CUSTOMER LOYALTY CREDIT                                                         

We provide a customer loyalty credit for policies that have been in force for   
more than six years. This is added to the account value each month. The dollar  
amount of the credit is a percentage of the total amount you then have in our   
investment options (not including any value we are holding as collateral for any
policy loans). The percentage credit is currently at an annual rate of .60%     
beginning in the policy's seventh year. This credit is not guaranteed, however. 
Because we first offered Paramount Life(SM) in 2002, no credit has yet been     
attained under any in-force policy.                                             

VARIATIONS AMONG PARAMOUNT LIFE(SM) POLICIES                                    

Time periods and other terms and conditions described in this prospectus may    
vary due to legal requirements in your state. These variations will be reflected
in your policy.                                                                 

Equitable Life also may vary the charges and other terms of Paramount Life(SM)  
where special circumstances result in sales or administrative expenses or       
mortality risks that are different from those normally associated with Paramount
Life(SM). We will make such variations only in accordance with uniform rules    
that we establish.                                                              

Equitable Life or your financial professional can advise you about any          
variations that may apply to your policy.                                       

YOUR OPTIONS FOR RECEIVING POLICY PROCEEDS 

BENEFICIARY OF DEATH BENEFIT. You designate your policy's beneficiary in your   
policy application. You can change the beneficiary at any other time during the 
insured person's life. If no beneficiary is living when the insured person dies,
we will pay the death benefit proceeds in equal shares to the insured person's  
surviving children. If there are no surviving children, we will instead pay the 
insured person's estate.                                                        

PAYMENT OPTIONS FOR DEATH BENEFIT. In your policy application, or at any other  
time during the insured person's life, you may choose among several payment     
options for all or part of any death benefit proceeds                           

                         More information about policy features and benefits  22

that subsequently become payable. These payment options are described in the    
policy and may result in varying tax consequences. A payment option selected by 
the policy's owner cannot be changed by the beneficiary after the insured person
dies. The terms and conditions of each option are set out in a separate contract
that we will send to the payee when a payment option goes into effect. Equitable
Life or your financial professional can provide you with samples of such        
contracts on request.                                                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can choose to have the proceeds from the policy's life insurance benefit    
paid under one of our payment options, rather than as a single sum.             
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not elected a payment option, we will pay any death benefit in a    
single sum. If the beneficiary is a natural person (i.e., not an entity such as 
a corporation or trust) we will pay any such single sum death benefit through an
interest-bearing checking account (the "Equitable Access AccountTM") that we    
will automatically open for the beneficiary. The beneficiary will have immediate
access to the proceeds by writing a check on the account. We pay interest on the
proceeds from the date of death to the date the beneficiary closes the Equitable
Access Account.                                                                 

If a financial professional has assisted the beneficiary in preparing the       
documents that are required for payment of the death benefit, we will send the  
Equitable Access Account checkbook or check to the financial professional within
the periods specified for death benefit payments under "When we pay policy
proceeds," below. Our financial professionals will take reasonable steps to     
arrange for prompt delivery to the beneficiary.                                 

PAYMENT OPTIONS FOR SURRENDER AND WITHDRAWAL PROCEEDS. You can also choose to   
receive all or part of any proceeds from a surrender or withdrawal from your    
policy under one of the above referenced payment options, rather than as a      
single sum.                                                                     

YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL WITHIN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS 

If for any reason you are not satisfied with your policy, you may return it to  
us for a full refund of the net account value. In some states, we will not      
adjust the premiums paid to reflect investment performance.                     

To exercise this cancellation right, you must mail the policy directly to our   
Administrative Office with a written request to cancel. Your cancellation       
request must be postmarked within 10 days after you receive the policy and your 
coverage will terminate as of the date of the postmark. In some states or       
situations, this "free look" period is longer than 10 days. Your policy will    
indicate the length of your "free look" period.

10. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT POLICY CHARGES                                       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEDUCTING POLICY CHARGES                                                        

PURPOSES OF POLICY CHARGES. The charges under the policies are designed to      
cover, in the aggregate, our direct and indirect costs of selling, administering
and providing benefits under the policies. They are also designed, in the       
aggregate, to compensate us for the risks of loss we assume pursuant to the     
policies. If, as we expect, the charges that we collect from the policies exceed
our total costs in connection with the policies, we will earn a profit.         
Otherwise, we will incur a loss.                                                

The current and maximum rates of certain of our charges have been set with      
reference to estimates of the amount of specific types of expenses or risks that
we will incur. In most cases, this prospectus identifies such expenses or risks 
in the name of the charge: e.g., the administrative charge, cost of insurance   
charge, and mortality and expense risk charge. However, the fact that any charge
bears the name of, or is designed primarily to defray, a particular expense or  
risk does not mean that the amount we collect from that charge will never be    
more than the amount of such expense or risk. Nor does it mean that we may not  
also be compensated for such expense or risk out of any other charges we are    
permitted to deduct by the terms of the policies. The surrender charge, for     
example, is designed primarily to defray sales expenses, but may also be used to
defray other expenses associated with your policy that we have not recovered by 
the time of any surrender. Similarly, the premium charge is designed primarily  
to defray sales and tax expenses we incur that are based on premium payments.   

MONTHLY COST OF INSURANCE CHARGE. The monthly cost of insurance charge is       
determined by multiplying the cost of insurance rate that is then applicable to 
your policy by the amount we have at risk under your policy. Our amount at risk 
(also described in your policy as "net amount at risk") on any date is the      
difference between (a) the death benefit that would be payable if the insured   
person died on that date and (b) the then total account value under the policy. 
A greater amount at risk, or a higher cost of insurance rate, will result in a  
higher monthly charge.                                                          

Generally, the cost of insurance rate increases from one policy year to the     
next. This happens automatically because of the insured person's increasing age.

Our cost of insurance rates are guaranteed not to exceed those that will be     
specified in your policy. For most insured persons at most ages, our current    
rates are lower than those maximums. Therefore, we have the ability to raise    
these rates up to the guaranteed maximum at any time. The guaranteed maximum    
cost of insurance rates for gender neutral Paramount Life(SM) policies for      
insureds who are under age 18 are based on the 1980 Commissioner's Standard     
Ordinary Mortality Table B. For all other policies, for insureds who are age 18 
or above, the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance rates are based on the 1980  
Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Male and Female Smoker and Non-Smoker Mortality
Tables. For insureds who are under 18, the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance 
rates are based on the 1980 Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Male and Female    
Mortality Tables.                                                               

Our cost of insurance rates will generally be lower (except for gender- neutral 
policies and in connection with certain employee benefit plans) if the insured  
person is a female than if a male. They also will generally be lower for        
non-tobacco users than tobacco users and lower for persons that have other      
highly favorable health characteristics, as compared to those that do not. On   
the other hand, insured persons who present particular health, occupational or  
avocational risks may be charged higher cost of insurance rates and other       
additional charges as specified in their policies. In addition, the current     
rates also vary depending on the duration of the policy (i.e., the length of    
time since the policy was issued).                                              

We offer lower rates for non-tobacco users only if they are at least age 18. You
may ask us to review a younger insured person's tobacco habits beginning on the 
policy anniversary on which such person is age 18.                              

Any insured person of attained age 18 or over being charged tobacco user rates  
may apply for non-tobacco user rates. The change, if approved, may result in    
lower future cost of insurance rates beginning on the effective date of the     
change to non-tobacco user rates.                                               

The change will be based upon our general underwriting rules in effect at the   
time of application, and may include criteria other than tobacco use status as  
well as a definition of tobacco use different from that applicable at the time  
this policy was issued.                                                         

The change to non-tobacco user rates, if approved, will take effect at the      
beginning of the policy month that coincides with or next follows the date we   
approve your request. This change may have adverse tax consequences.            

DATE OF MONTHLY DEDUCTIONS. We make the regular monthly deductions as of the    
first day of each month of the policy.                                          

TRUST LEVEL CHARGES. Charges are deducted from and expenses are paid out of the 
assets of the underlying Portfolios. These charges and expenses are described in
the prospectuses for the underlying Portfolios.

11. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO YOUR POLICY                 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides further detail about certain subjects that are addressed  
in the previous pages. The following discussion generally does not repeat the   
information already contained in those pages.                                   

DATES AND PRICES AT WHICH POLICY EVENTS OCCUR                                   

We describe below the general rules for when, and at what prices, events under  
your policy will occur. Other portions of this prospectus describe circumstances
that may cause exceptions. We generally do not repeat those exceptions below.   

DATE OF RECEIPT. Where this prospectus refers to the day when we receive a      
payment, request, election, or notice from you, we usually mean the day on which
that item (or the last thing necessary for us to process that item) arrives in  
complete and proper form at our Administrative Office, or via the appropriate   
telephone or fax number if the item is a type we accept by those means. There   
are two main exceptions: if the item arrives (1) on a day that is not a business
day or (2) after the close of a business day, then, in each case, we are deemed 
to have received that item on the next business day.                            

BUSINESS DAYS. Business day is every day that the New York Stock Exchange is    
open for regular trading. A business day ends at the time regular trading on the
exchange closes (or is suspended) for the day. We compute unit values for our   
variable investment options as of the end of each business day. This usually is 
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time.                                                        

PAYMENTS YOU MAKE. The following are reflected in your policy as of the date we 
receive them:                                                                   

o   premium payments received after the policy's investment start date

o   loan repayments and interest payments                                       

REQUESTS YOU MAKE. The following transactions occur as of the date we receive   
your request:                                                                   

o   withdrawals                                                                 

o   tax withholding elections                                                   

o   face amount decreases that result from a withdrawal                         

o   changes of allocation percentages for premium payments or monthly deductions

o   surrenders                                                                  

o   changes of beneficiary                                                      

o   transfers from a variable investment option to the guaranteed interest      
option                                                                  

o   changes in form of death benefit payment                                    

o   loans                                                                       

o   transfers among variable investment options                                 

o   assignments                                                                 

o   termination of paid up death benefit guarantee                              

The following transactions occur on your policy's next monthly anniversary that 
coincides with or follows the date we approve your request:                     

o   decrease in face amount                                                     

o   election of paid up death benefit guarantee                                 

o   changes in death benefit option                                             

o   changes of insured person                                                   

o   restoration of terminated policies                                          

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING SERVICE. Transfers pursuant to our dollar cost averaging  
service (automatic transfer service) occur as of the first day of each policy   
month. If you request the dollar cost averaging service in your original policy 
application, the first transfer will occur as of the first day of the second    
policy month after your policy's initial Allocation Date. If you request this   
service at any later time, we make the first such transfer as of your policy's  
first monthly anniversary that coincides with or follows the date we receive    
your request.                                                                   

ASSET REBALANCING SERVICE. If you request the asset rebalancing service, the    
first redistribution will be on the date you specify or the date we receive your
request, if later. However, no rebalancing will occur before your policy's      
Allocation Date. Subsequent periodic rebalancings occur quarterly, semiannually 
or annually, as you have requested.                                             

DELAY IN CERTAIN CASES. We may delay allocating any payment you make to our     
variable investment options, or any transfer, for the same reasons stated in    
"Delay of variable investment option proceeds" later in this prospectus. We may 
also delay such transactions for any other legally permitted purpose.           

PRICES APPLICABLE TO POLICY TRANSACTIONS. If a transaction will increase or     
decrease the amount you have in a variable investment option as of a certain    
date, we process the transaction using the unit values for that option computed 
as of that day's close of business, unless that day is not a business day. In   
that case, we use unit values computed as of the next business day's close.     

EFFECT OF DEATH OR SURRENDER. You may not make any surrender or partial         
withdrawal request after the insured person has died. Also, all insurance       
coverage ends on the date as of which we process any request for a surrender.   

POLICY ISSUANCE                                                                 

REGISTER DATE. When we issue a policy, we assign it a "register date," which    
will be shown in the policy. We measure the months, years, and anniversaries of 
your policy from your policy's register date.                                   

o   If you submit the full minimum initial premium to your financial            
  professional at the time you sign the application and before the policy is
issued, and we issue the policy as it was applied for, then the register
date will be the later of (a) the date you signed part I of the policy  
application or (b) the date a medical professional signed part II of the
policy application.                                                     

25  More information about procedures that apply to your policy                 

P-->485APOS31st Page of 69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 31st
o   If we do not receive your full minimum initial premium at our Administrative
    Office before the issue date or, if we issue the policy on a different basis
than you applied for, the register date will be the same as the date we 
actually issue the policy (the "issue date").                           

Policies that would otherwise receive a register date of the 29th, 30th or 31st 
of any month will receive a register date of the 28th of that month.            

We may also permit an earlier than customary register date (a) for              
employer-sponsored cases, to accommodate a common register date for all         
employees or (b) to provide a younger age at issue. (A younger age at issue     
reduces the monthly charges that we deduct under a policy.) The charges and     
deductions commence as of the register date, even when we have permitted an     
early register date. We may also permit policyowners to delay a register date   
(up to three months) in employer-sponsored cases.                               

INVESTMENT START DATE. This is the date your investment first begins to earn a  
return for you. Generally, this is the register date, or, if later, the date we 
receive your full minimum initial premium at our Administrative Office.         

COMMENCEMENT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE. You must give the full minimum initial      
premium to your financial professional on or before the day the policy is       
delivered to you. No insurance under your policy will take effect unless (1) the
insured person is still living at the time such payment and delivery are        
completed and (2) the information in the application continues to be true and   
complete, without material change, as of the time of such payment. If you submit
the full minimum initial premium with your application, we may, subject to      
certain conditions, provide a limited amount of temporary insurance on the      
proposed insured person. You may request and review a copy of our temporary     
insurance agreement for more information about the terms and conditions of that 
coverage. If you do not submit the full minimum initial premium with your       
application and the minimum initial premium is paid upon delivery, your monthly 
charges commence as of the register date. Generally, the register date will be  
earlier than the date coverage begins and therefore monthly deductions will     
apply before coverage is in effect.                                             

NON-ISSUANCE. If, after considering your application, we decide not to issue a  
policy, we will refund any premium you have paid, without interest.             

AGE; AGE AT ISSUE. Unless the context in this prospectus requires otherwise, we 
consider the insured person's "age" during any policy year to be his or her age 
on his or her birthday nearest to the beginning of that policy year. For        
example, the insured person's age for the first policy year ("age at issue") is 
that person's age on whichever birthday is closer to (i.e., before or after) the
policy's register date.                                                         

WAYS TO MAKE PREMIUM AND LOAN PAYMENTS                                          

CHECKS AND MONEY ORDERS. Premiums or loan payments generally must be paid by    
check or money order drawn on a U.S. bank in U.S. dollars and made payable to   
"Equitable Life."                                                               

We prefer that you make each payment to us with a single check drawn on your    
business or personal bank account. We also will accept a single money order,    
bank draft or cashier's check payable directly to Equitable Life, although we   
must report such "cash equivalent" payments to the Internal Revenue Service     
under certain circumstances. Cash and travelers' checks, or any payments in     
foreign currency, are not acceptable. We will accept third-party checks payable 
to someone other than Equitable Life and endorsed over to Equitable Life only   
(1) as a direct payment from a qualified retirement plan or (2) if they are made
out to a trustee who owns the policy and endorses the entire check (without any 
refund) as a payment to the policy.                                             

REQUIREMENTS FOR SURRENDER REQUESTS                                             

Your surrender request must include the policy number, your name, your tax      
identification number, the name of the insured person, and the address where    
proceeds should be mailed. The request must be signed by you, as the owner, and 
by any joint owner, collateral assignee or irrevocable beneficiary. We may also 
require you to complete specific tax forms.                                     

Finally, in order for your surrender request to be complete, you must return    
your policy to us.                                                              

GENDER-NEUTRAL POLICIES                                                         

Congress and various states have from time to time considered legislation that  
would require insurance rates to be the same for males and females. In addition,
employers and employee organizations should consider, in consultation with      
counsel, the impact of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on the purchase
of Paramount Life(SM) in connection with an employment-related insurance or     
benefit plan. In a 1983 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that,    
under Title VII, optional annuity benefits under a deferred compensation plan   
could not vary on the basis of sex.                                             

There will be no distinctions based on sex in the cost of insurance rates for   
Paramount Life(SM) policies sold in Montana. We will also make such             
gender-neutral policies available on request in connection with certain employee
benefit plans. Cost of insurance rates applicable to a gender-neutral policy    
will not be greater than the comparable male rates under a gender specific      
Paramount Life(SM) policy.

12. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER MATTERS                                        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT                                                       

Our general account assets support all of our obligations, (including those     
under the Paramount Life(SM) policies and, more specifically, the guaranteed    
interest option). Our general assets consist of all of our assets as to which no
class or classes of our annuity or life insurance policies have any preferential
claim. You will not share in the investment experience of our general account   
assets, however; and we have full discretion about how we invest those assets   
(subject only to any requirements of law).                                      

Because of applicable exemptions and exclusions, we have not registered         
interests in the general account under the Securities Act of 1933 or registered 
the general account as an investment company with the SEC. Accordingly, neither 
the general account, the guaranteed interest option, nor any interests therein, 
are subject to regulation under those acts. The staff of the SEC has not        
reviewed the portions of this prospectus that relate to the general account and 
the guaranteed interest option. The disclosure, however, may be subject to      
certain provisions of the federal securities law relating to the accuracy and   
completeness of statements made in prospectuses.                                

TRANSFERS OF YOUR ACCOUNT VALUE                                                 

TRANSFERS NOT IMPLEMENTED. When we cannot process part of a transfer request, we
will not process any other part of the request. This could occur, for example,  
where the request does not comply with our transfer limitations, or where you   
request transfer of an amount greater than that currently allocated to an       
investment option.                                                              

Similarly, the dollar cost averaging service will terminate immediately if: (1) 
your amount in the EQ/Money Market option is insufficient to cover the automatic
transfer amount; (2) your policy is in a grace period; or (3) we receive notice 
of the insured person's death. Similarly, the asset rebalancing program will    
terminate if either (2) or (3) occurs.                                          

DISRUPTIVE TRANSFER ACTIVITY. You should note that the Paramount Life(SM)       
contract is not designed for professional "market timing" organizations or other
organizations or individuals engaging in a market timing strategy, making       
programmed transfers, frequent transfers or transfers that are large in relation
to the total assets of the underlying Portfolio. These kinds of strategies and  
transfer activities are disruptive to the underlying Portfolios in which the    
variable investment options invest. If we determine that your transfer patterns 
among the variable investment options are disruptive to the underlying          
Portfolios, we may among other things restrict the availability of personal     
telephone requests, facsimile transmissions, automated telephone services,      
Internet services or any electronic transfer services. We may also refuse to act
on transfer instructions of an agent acting under a power of attorney who is    
acting on behalf of one or more owners. In making these determinations, we may  
consider the combined transfer activity in all annuity contracts and life       
insurance policies that we believe are under common ownership, control or       
direction.                                                                      

We currently consider transfers into and out of (or vice versa) the same        
variable investment option within a five business day period as potentially     
disruptive transfer activity. In order to prevent disruptive activity, we       
monitor the frequency of transfers, including the size of transfers in relation 
to Portfolio assets, in each underlying Portfolio, and we take appropriate      
action, which may include the actions described above to restrict availability  
of voice, fax and automated transaction services, when we consider the activity 
of owners to be disruptive. We currently provide a letter to owners who have    
engaged in such activity of our intention to restrict such services. However, we
may not continue to provide such letters. We may also, in our sole discretion   
and without further notice, change what we consider disruptive transfer         
activity, as well as change our procedures to restrict this activity.           

TELEPHONE AND EQACCESS REQUESTS 

If you are a properly authorized person, you may make transfers between         
investment options by telephone or over the Internet as described earlier in    
this prospectus in "How to Make Transfers" under "Transferring your money among 
our investment options."                                                        

Also, you may make the following additional types of requests by calling the    
number under "By toll-free phone" in "How to reach us" from a touch-tone phone, 
if you are both the owner of the policy and the insured person, or through      
EQAccess if you are the individual owner:                                       

o   changes of premium allocation percentages                                   

o   changes of address                                                          

Currently, you may request a policy loan by calling the toll-free number.       

For security purposes, all telephone requests are automatically tape-recorded   
and are invalid if the information given is incomplete or any portion of the    
request is inaudible. We have established procedures reasonably designed to     
confirm that telephone instructions are genuine. These include requiring        
personal identification information from the caller and providing subsequent    
written confirmation of the instructions.                                       

If you wish to participate in EQAccess, you must first agree to the terms and   
conditions set forth in our EQAccess Online Services Agreement, which you can   
find at our Web site. For security purposes, you may not initiate any           
transactions relating to your policy for five (5) days after you have elected to
use EQAccess. We will send you a confirmation letter by first class mail.       
Additionally, you will be required to use a password and protect it from        
unauthorized use. We will provide subsequent written confirmation of any        
EQAccess transactions. We will assume that all instructions received through    
EQAccess from anyone using your password are given by you; however, we reserve  
the right to refuse to process any transaction and/or block access to EQAccess  
if we have reason to believe the instructions given are unauthorized.           

If we do not employ reasonable procedures to confirm the genuineness of         
telephone or Internet instructions, we may be liable for any

P-->485APOS33rd Page of 69TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 33rd
losses arising out of any act or omission that constitutes negligence, lack of  
good faith, or willful misconduct. In light of our procedures, we will not be   
liable for following telephone or Internet instructions that we reasonably      
believe to be genuine.                                                          

We reserve the right to refuse to process any telephone or Internet transactions
if we have reason to believe that the request compromises the general security  
and/or integrity of our automated systems (see discussion of "Disruptive
transfer activity" above).                                                      

Any telephone, Internet or facsimile transaction request that we receive after  
the close of a business day (which is usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) will be   
processed as of the next business day. During times of extreme market activity, 
or for other reasons, you may be unable to contact us to make a telephone or    
Internet request. If this occurs, you should submit a written transaction       
request to our Administrative Office. We reserve the right to discontinue       
telephone or Internet transactions, or modify the procedures and conditions for 
such transactions, without notifying you, at any time.                          

SUICIDE AND CERTAIN MISSTATEMENTS                                               

If an insured person commits suicide within certain time periods, the amount of 
death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy. Also, if an    
application misstated the age or gender of an insured person, we will adjust the
amount of any death benefit (and certain rider benefits), as described in the   
policy (or rider).                                                              

WHEN WE PAY POLICY PROCEEDS 

GENERAL. We will generally pay any death benefit, surrender, withdrawal, or loan
within seven days after we receive the request and any other required items.    

CLEARANCE OF CHECKS. We reserve the right to defer payment of that portion of   
your account value that is attributable to a premium payment or loan repayment  
made by check for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 15 days) to allow  
the check to clear the banking system.                                          

DELAY OF GUARANTEED INTEREST OPTION PROCEEDS. We also have the right to defer   
payment or transfers of amounts out of our guaranteed interest option for up to 
six months. If we delay more than 30 days in paying you such amounts, we will   
pay interest of at least 3% per year from the date we receive your request.     

DELAY OF VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTION PROCEEDS. We reserve the right to defer     
payment of any death benefit, transfer, loan or other distribution that is      
derived from a variable investment option if (a) the New York Stock Exchange is 
closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings) or trading on that   
exchange is restricted; (b) the SEC has declared that an emergency exists, as a 
result of which disposal of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is   
not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the account value; or (c) the law
permits the delay for the protection of owners. If we need to defer calculation 
of values for any of the foregoing reasons, all delayed transactions will be    
processed at the next available unit values.                                    

DELAY TO CHALLENGE COVERAGE. We may challenge the validity of your insurance    
policy or any rider based on any material misstatements in an application you   
have made to us. We cannot make such challenges, however, beyond certain time   
limits set forth in the policy or rider. If the insured person dies within one  
of these limits, we may delay payment of any proceeds until we decide whether to

CHANGES WE CAN MAKE 

In addition to any of the other changes described in this prospectus, we have   
the right to modify how we or Separate Account FP operate. We intend to comply  
with applicable law in making any changes and, if necessary, we will seek       
policyowner approval. We have the right to:                                     

o   combine two or more variable investment options or withdraw assets relating 
   to Paramount Life(SM) from one investment option and put them into another;

o   end the registration of, or re-register, Separate Account FP under the      
Investment Company Act of 1940;                                         

o   operate Separate Account FP under the direction of a "committee" or         
discharge such a committee at any time;                                 

o   restrict or eliminate any voting rights or privileges of policyowners (or   
other persons) that affect Separate Account FP;                         

o   operate Separate Account FP, or one or more of the variable investment      
options, in any other form the law allows. This includes any form that  
  allows us to make direct investments, in which case we may charge Separate
 Account FP an advisory fee. We may make any legal investments we wish for
    Separate Account FP. In addition, we may disapprove any change in investment
advisers or in investment policy unless a law or regulation provides    
differently.                                                            

If we take any action that results in a material change in the underlying       
investments of a variable investment option, we will notify you to the extent   
required by law. We may, for example, cause the variable investment option to   
invest in a mutual fund other than, or in addition to, the Trusts. If you then  
wish to transfer the amount you have in that option to another investment       
option, you may do so.                                                          

We may make any changes in the policy or its riders, require additional premium 
payments, or make distributions from the policy to the extent we deem necessary 
to ensure that your policy qualifies or continues to qualify as life insurance  
for tax purposes. Any such change will apply uniformly to all policies that are 
affected. We will give you written notice of such changes. Subject to all       
applicable legal requirements, we also may make other changes in the policies   
that do not reduce any net cash surrender value, death benefit, account value,  
or other accrued rights or benefits.                                            

REPORTS WE WILL SEND YOU                                                        

Shortly after the end of each year of your policy, we will send you a report    
that includes information about your policy's current death benefit, account    
value, cash surrender value (i.e., account value minus any current surrender    
charge), policy loans, policy transactions and amounts of charges deducted. We  
will send you individual notices to confirm your premium payments, loan         
repayments, transfers and certain other policy transactions.

14. PERSONALIZED ILLUSTRATIONS                                                  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ILLUSTRATIONS OF POLICY BENEFITS                                                

HYPOTHETICAL AND PERSONALIZED ILLUSTRATIONS. Illustrations are intended to show 
how different fees, charges and rates of return can affect the values available 
under a policy. Illustrations are based upon characteristics of a hypothetical  
insured person as well as other assumed factors. This type of illustration is   
called a hypothetical illustration. Illustrations can also be based upon some of
the characteristics of the insured person under your policy as well as some     
other policy feature choices you make such as the face amount, death benefit    
option, premium payment amounts and assumed rates of return (within limits).    
This type of illustration is called a personalized illustration. NO ILLUSTRATION
WILL EVER SHOW YOU THE ACTUAL VALUES AVAILABLE UNDER YOUR POLICY AT ANY GIVEN   
POINT IN TIME. This is because many factors affect these values including: (i)  
the insured person's characteristics; (ii) policy features you choose; (iii)    
actual premium payments you make; (iv) loans or withdrawals you make; and (v)   
actual rates of return (including the actual fees and expenses) of the          
underlying portfolios in which your cash value is invested. Each hypothetical or
personalized illustration is accompanied by an explanation of the assumptions on
which that illustration is based. Because, as discussed below, these assumptions
may differ considerably, you should carefully review all of the disclosure that 
accompanies each illustration.                                                  

DIFFERENT KINDS OF ILLUSTRATIONS. Both hypothetical and personalized            
illustrations can reflect the investment management fees and expenses incurred  
in 2001 (or expected to be incurred in 2002, if such amount is expected to be   
higher) of the available underlying portfolios in different ways. An arithmetic 
illustration uses the straight average of all of the available underlying       
portfolios' investment management fees and expenses. A weighted illustration    
computes the average of investment management fees and expenses based upon an   
assumed percentage allocation of premium payments among the available underlying
portfolios (currently, this type of illustration is limited to a combination of 
up to five of the available underlying portfolios). A fund specific illustration
uses only the investment management fees and expenses of a specific underlying  
portfolio. An arithmetic/weighted illustration uses the straight average of all 
of the available underlying portfolios' investment management fees and a        
weighted average (based upon the aggregate assets in each portfolio at the end  
of 2001) of the expenses of all of the available portfolios. A historical       
illustration reflects the actual performance of one of the available underlying 
portfolios during a stated period. When reviewing a weighted, fund specific, or 
arithmetic/weighted illustration you should keep in mind that the values shown  
may be higher than the values shown in other illustrations because the fees and 
expenses that are assumed may be lower than those assumed in other              
illustrations. When reviewing a historical illustration you should keep in mind 
that values based upon past performance are no indication of what the values    
will be based on future performance.                                            

THE EFFECT OF THE EXPENSE LIMITATION ARRANGEMENTS. The investment management    
fees and expenses used in all of the illustrations reflect the expense          
limitation arrangements that are in effect with respect to certain of the       
Portfolios (see the fee table under "Risk/benefit summary: Charges and expenses 
you will pay" earlier in this prospectus). If these fees and expenses were not  
reduced to reflect the expense limitation arrangements in effect, the values in 
the illustrations would be lower.                                               

You can request an arithmetic illustration as well any of the other             
illustrations described above. Appendix III to the prospectus contains an       
arithmetic hypothetical illustration.

APPENDIX I: INFORMATION ON MARKET PERFORMANCE                                   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In reports or other communications to policyowners or in advertising material,  
we may describe general economic and market conditions affecting our variable   
investment options, and the Portfolios. We may also compare the performance or  
ranking of those options and the Portfolios with:                               

o   those of other insurance company separate accounts or mutual funds included 
  in the rankings prepared by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc., Morningstar,
Inc. or similar investment services that monitor the performance of     
insurance company separate accounts or mutual funds;                    

o   other appropriate indices of investment securities, the Consumer Price Index
and averages for peer universes of mutual funds;                        

o   data developed by us derived from such indices or averages; or              

o   other appropriate types of securities (e.g., common stocks, long-term       
 government bonds, long-term corporate bonds, intermediate term government
bonds, and U.S. treasury bills).                                        

We also may furnish to present or prospective policyowners advertisements or    
other communications that include evaluations of a variable investment option or
Portfolio by nationally recognized financial publications. Examples of such     
publications are:

Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. (Lipper) compiles performance data for peer    
universes of Portfolios with similar investment objectives in its Lipper        
Variable Insurance Products Performance Analysis Service (Lipper Survey).       
Morningstar, Inc. compiles similar data in the Morningstar Variable             
Annuity/Life Report (Morningstar Report).                                       

The Lipper Survey records performance data as reported to it by over 800 mutual 
funds underlying variable annuity and life insurance products. It divides these 
actively managed portfolios into 25 categories by portfolio objectives. The     
Lipper Survey contains two different universes, which reflect different types of
fees in performance data:                                                       

o   The "Separate Account" universe reports performance data net of investment  
management fees, direct operating expenses and asset-based charges      
applicable under variable insurance and annuity contracts; and          

o   The "Mutual Fund" universe reports performance net only of investment       
  management fees and direct operating expenses, and therefore reflects only
charges that relate to the underlying mutual fund.                      

The Morningstar Report consists of nearly 700 variable life and annuity         
portfolios, all of which report their data net of investment management fees,   
direct operating expenses and separate account level charges.                   

LONG-TERM MARKET TRENDS                                                         

Historically, the investment performance of common stocks over the long term has
generally been superior to that of long- or short-term debt securities. However,
common stocks have also experienced dramatic changes in value over short periods
of time. One of our variable investment options that invests primarily in common
stocks may, therefore, be a desirable selection for owners who are willing to   
accept such risks. If, on the other hand, you wish to limit your short-term     
risk, you may find it preferable to allocate a smaller percentage of net        
premiums to those options that invest primarily in common stock. All investments
in securities, whether equity or debt, involve varying degrees of risk. They    
also offer varying degrees of potential reward.

APPENDIX III: HYPOTHETICAL ILLUSTRATIONS                                        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ILLUSTRATION OF DEATH BENEFITS, ACCOUNT VALUES, NET CASH SURRENDER VALUES 
AND ACCUMULATED PREMIUMS

The following tables illustrate the changes in death benefit, account value and 
net cash surrender value of the policy under certain hypothetical circumstances 
that we assume solely for this purpose. Each table illustrates the operation of 
a policy for a specified issue age, premium payment schedule and face amount    
under death benefit option A and death benefit option B. The amounts shown are  
for the end of each policy year and assume that all of the account value is     
invested in Portfolios that achieve investment returns at constant gross annual 
rates of 0%, 6% and 12% (i.e., before any investment management fees or other   
expenses are deducted from the underlying Portfolio assets). After the deduction
of the arithmetic average of the investment management fees and other expenses  
of all of the underlying Portfolios (as described below), the corresponding net 
annual rates of return would be ( . )%, . % and . %. These net annual rates of  
return do not reflect the mortality and expense risk charge or the other charges
we deduct from your policy's value each month. If the net annual rates of return
did reflect these charges, the rates shown would be lower; however, the values  
shown in the following tables also reflect all policy charges. Investment return
reflects investment income and all realized and unrealized capital gains and    
losses. The tables assume annual Planned Periodic Premiums that are paid at the 
beginning of each policy year for an insured person who is a 45 -year- old      
preferred risk male non-tobacco user when the policy is issued.                 

Tables are provided for each of the two death benefit options. The tables headed
"Current Charges" assume that the current rates for all charges deducted by     
Equitable Life will apply in each year illustrated. The tables headed "Maximum  
Charges" are the same, except that the maximum permitted rates for all years are
used for all charges. The tables do not reflect any charge that we reserve the  
right to make but are not currently making. The tables assume that (i) no       
optional rider benefits have been elected, (ii) no loans or withdrawals are     
made, (iii) no decreases in coverage are requested and (iv) no change in the    
death benefit option is requested.                                              

With respect to fees and expenses deducted from assets of the underlying        
Portfolios, the amounts shown in all tables reflect (1) investment management   
fees equivalent to an effective annual rate of . %, and (2) an assumed average  
asset charge for all other expenses of the underlying Portfolios equivalent to  
an effective annual rate of . %. These rates are the arithmetic average for all 
Portfolios that are available as investment options. In other words, they are   
based on the hypothetical assumption that policy account values are allocated   
equally among the variable investment options. The actual rates associated with 
any policy will vary depending upon the actual allocation of policy values among
the investment options. These rates do not reflect expense limitation           
arrangements in effect with respect to certain of the underlying Portfolios. If 
those arrangements had been assumed to continue for all years illustrated, the  
policy values would be higher than those shown in the following tables.         

The second column of each table shows the amount you would have at the end of   
each policy year if an amount equal to the assumed planned periodic premiums    
were invested to earn interest, after taxes, at 5% annually. This is not a      
policy value. It is included for comparison purposes only.                      

Because your circumstances will no doubt differ from those in the illustrations 
that follow, values under your policy will differ, in most cases substantially. 
Upon request, we will furnish you with a personalized illustration as described 
under "Illustrations of policy benefits" in "Personalized illustrations,"       
earlier in this prospectus.

WAYS WE PAY POLICY PROCEEDS 

The payee for death benefit or other policy proceeds (e.g., upon surrenders)    
may name a successor to receive any amounts that we still owe following the     
payee's death. Otherwise, we will pay any such amounts to the payee's estate.   

We must approve any payment arrangements that involve more than one payment     
option, or a payee who is not a natural person (for example, a corporation), or 
a payee who is a fiduciary. Also, the details of all payment arrangements will  
be subject to our rules at the time the arrangements are selected and take      
effect. This includes rules on the minimum amount we will pay under an option,  
minimum amounts for installment payments, withdrawal or commutation rights      
(your rights to receive payments over time, for which we may offer a lump sum   
payment), the naming of payees, and the methods for proving the payee's age and 
continued survival.                                                             

ASSIGNING YOUR POLICY 

You may assign (transfer) your rights in a policy to someone else as collateral 
for a loan, to effect a change of ownership or for some other reason, if we     
agree. Collateral assignments may also sometimes be used in connection with     
dividing the benefits of the policy under a split-dollar arrangement, which     
will also have its own tax consequences. A copy of the assignment must be       
forwarded to our Administrative Office. We are not responsible for any payment  
we make or any action we take before we receive notice of the assignment or for 
the validity of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of           
ownership.                                                                      

Certain transfers for value may subject you to income tax and penalties and     
cause the death benefit to lose its income-tax free treatment. Further, a gift  
of a policy that has a loan outstanding may be treated as part gift and part    
transfer for value, which could result in both gift tax and income tax          
consequences. The IRS has issued proposed regulations concerning split-dollar   
arrangements, including policies subject to collateral assignments. The         
proposed regulations provide both new proposed and interim guidance as to the   
taxation of such arrangements. These regulations address taxation issues in     
connection with arrangements which are compensatory in nature, involve a        
shareholder and corporation, or a donor and donee. See also discussion under    
"Employee benefit programs" and "Estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes" in 
the "Tax information" section of the prospectus. You should consult your tax    
advisor prior to making a transfer or assignment.                               

YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR POLICY'S INSURED PERSON 

After the policy's second year, we will permit you to request that a new        
insured person replace the existing one. This requires that you provide us with 
adequate evidence that the proposed new insured person meets our requirements   
for insurance. Other requirements are outlined in your policy.                  

Upon making this change, the monthly insurance charges we deduct will be based  
on the new insured person's insurance risk characteristics and may result in a  
loss of the five year no-lapse guarantee. The change of insured person will     
not, however, affect the surrender charge computation for the amount of         
coverage that is then in force.                                                 

Substituting the insured person is a taxable event and may, depending upon      
individual circumstances, have other tax consequences as well. For example, the 
change could cause the policy to be a "modified endowment contract" or to fail  
the Internal Revenue Code's definition of "life insurance," unless we also      
distribute certain amounts to you from the policy. See "Tax information" in the 
prospectus. You should consult your tax advisor prior to substituting the       
insured person. As a condition to substituting the insured person we may        
require you to sign a form acknowledging the potential tax consequences. In no  
event, however, will we permit a change that causes your policy to fail the     
definition of life insurance.                                                   

HOW WE MARKET THE POLICIES 

We offer variable life insurance policies (including Paramount Life(SM)) and    
variable annuity contracts through AXA Advisors, LLC ("AXA Advisors"), the      
successor to EQ Financial Consultants, Inc., and an affiliate of Equitable      
Life. AXA Advisors and Equitable Life are under the common control (or are      
subsidiaries) of AXA Financial, Inc. The Investment Company Act of 1940,        
therefore, classifies AXA Advisors as the "principal underwriter" of those      
policies and contracts. As such, AXA Advisors distributes these policies        
pursuant to a selling agreement, dated as of May 1, 1994, as amended, among AXA 
Advisors and Equitable Life. The Agreement provides that AXA Advisors will make 
a best-efforts offering of the policies on a continuous basis. AXA Advisors'    
address is 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10104. AXA Advisors is     
registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National      
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"). For each of the years 2002    
and 2001, AXA Advisors was paid an administrative services fee of $     .       
Equitable Life paid AXA Advisors as the distributor of certain contracts, and   
as the principal underwriter of several Equitable Life separate accounts,       
including Separate Account FP, $         in 2002 and $543,488,990 in 2001. Of   
these amounts, AXA Advisors retained $        and $277,057,837, respectively.   

We sell Paramount Life(SM) through financial professionals who are licensed     
insurance agents and are also registered representatives of AXA Advisors. The   
financial professional who sells you this policy receives sales commissions     
from Equitable Life. Generally, the agents will receive maximum commissions of: 
35.5% of premiums you pay up to one target premium in your policy's first two   
years; plus 9% of additional premiums you pay up to nine target premiums in     
your policy's first ten years; plus 2.5% of all other premiums you pay in any   
year. However, the 9% and 2.5% rates are reduced to 5.5% and 1.5% respectively, 
for premiums you pay in your policy's first year.                               

The commissions don't cost you anything above the charges and expenses already  
discussed in the prospectus.                                                    

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Equitable Life and its affiliates are parties to various legal proceedings. In  
our view, none of these proceedings would be considered material with respect   
to a policyowner's interest in Separate Account FP, nor would any of these      
proceedings be likely to have a material adverse effect upon the Separate       
Account, our ability to meet our obligations under the policies, or the         
distribution of the policies.

INSURANCE REGULATION THAT APPLIES TO EQUITABLE LIFE 

We are regulated and supervised by the New York State Insurance Department. In  
addition, we are subject to the insurance laws and regulations in every state   
where we sell policies. We submit annual reports on our operations and finances 
to insurance officials in all of these states. The officials are responsible    
for reviewing our reports to see that we are financially sound. Such            
regulation, however, does not guarantee or provide absolute assurance of our    
soundness.                                                                      

CUSTODIAN AND INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 

Equitable Life is the custodian for shares of the Trusts owned by Separate

accounting. Equitable Life paid fees to PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC for         
auditing the financial statements of the Portfolios of Separate Account FP and  
the financial statements of Equitable Life for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002.

Item 30. Indemnification                                                        

(a) Indemnification of Officers and Directors                 

   The by-laws of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United
States ("Equitable Life") provide, in Article VII, as follows:                  

    7.4  Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees.

          (a)  To the extent permitted by the law of the State of New York
       and subject to all applicable requirements thereof:

                    (i)  Any person made or threatened to be made a party to any
                     action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by
                  reason of the fact that he or she, or his or her
                        testator or intestate is or was a director, officer or
                     employee of the Company shall be indemnified by the
Company;                      

                   (ii)  Any person made or threatened to be made a party to any
                     action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by
                  reason of the fact that he or she, or his or her
                  testator or intestate serves or served any other
                    organization in any capacity at the request of the
                Company may be indemnified by the Company; and

                 (iii)  the related expenses of any such person in any of said
            categories may be advanced by the Company.

           (b)  To the extent permitted by the law of the State of New York,
                the Company or the Board of Directors, by amendment of these
       By-Laws, or by agreement. (Business Corporation Law
ss.ss.721-726: Insurance Law ss.1216).      

         The directors and officers of Equitable Life are insured under policies
issued by Lloyd's of London, X.L. Insurance Company and ACE Insurance Company.  
The annual limit on such policies is $150 million, and the policies insure the  
officers and directors against certain liabilities arising out of their conduct 
in such capacities.                                                             

(b) Indemnification of Principal Underwriter                  

        To the extent permitted by law of the State of New York and subject to
all applicable requirements thereof, AXA Advisors, LLC has undertaken to        
indemnify each of its directors and officers who is made or threatened to be    
made a party to any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by reason  
of the fact the director or officer, or his or her testator or intestate, is or 
was a director or officer of AXA Advisors, LLC                                  

(c) Undertaking                                               

       Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling     
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,   
the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and       
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed  
in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for      
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the         
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling   
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or       
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in      
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless    
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling        
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether   
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act     
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.                   

Item 31. Principal Underwriters                                                 

    (a) AXA Advisors, LLC, an affiliate of Equitable, is the principal
underwriter for Separate Account No. 45, Separate Account No. 301, Separate     
Account FP, Separate Account A, Separate Account I and EQ Advisors Trust. The   
principal business address of AXA Advisors, LLC is 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 
NY, NY 10104.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
