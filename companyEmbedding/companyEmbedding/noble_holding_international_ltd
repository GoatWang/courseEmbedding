Noble Holding International Limited Announces Early Results Of Cash Tender Offers For Senior Notes
Dec 28 16
Noble Corporation plc announced, on behalf of its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited (NHIL), the results to date of the company's cash tender offers for the outstanding notes: 4.90% senior notes due 2020, 3.95% senior notes due 2022, 4.625% senior notes due 2021, the tender offers will expire at midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on January 11, 2017 (such date and time with respect to a tender offer, as it may be extended for such tender offers, the expiration date).  No tenders will be valid if submitted after the expiration date.  The deadline for holders to validly withdraw tenders of notes has passed.  Accordingly, notes that were already tendered at or before the early tender date and any additional notes that are tendered at or prior to the expiration date may not be withdrawn, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. The tender offers were only made pursuant to the terms and conditions as described in the offer to purchase and the related letter of transmittal. However, the financing condition with respect to the tender offers is expected to be satisfied on the date hereof upon the closing of the company's previously announced offering of 7.750% senior unsecured notes due 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000. The aggregate principal amount of the company's 4.90% senior notes due 2020 that may be purchased pursuant to the tender offers may not exceed $300,000,000. As of the early tender date, the 2020 tender cap has been exceeded and, as a result, the company will not accept for purchase any additional 2020 notes tendered in the tender offers after the early tender date. The proration factor for the 2020 Notes is approximately 89%. Because the aggregate principal amount of the notes tendered at or prior to the early tender date would result in an aggregate purchase price (as defined in the offer to purchase) that exceeds $750 million, or the aggregate maximum tender amount (as defined in the offer to purchase), the 4.625% senior notes due 2021 that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the early tender date will be prorated and accepted for purchase, and the company will not accept for purchase any additional notes tendered after the early tender date.  Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all remaining conditions to the tender offers described in the offer to purchase having been either satisfied or waived by the company, the company expects to accept tenders of 2020 notes up to the 2020 tender cap, all 3.95% senior notes due 2022, and 4.625% senior notes due 2021 based on a proration factor of approximately 61%.


Noble Holding International Limited Announces Increase in Maximum Tender Amount in Cash Tender Offer for Senior Notes
Dec 15 16
Noble Corporation plc announced, on behalf of its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited, that it has increased the aggregate maximum purchase price for its previously announced cash tender offers (the tender offers) relating to the company's 4.90% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes), the company's 4.625% senior notes due 2021 and the company's 3.95% senior notes due 2022, from $500,000,000 to $750,000,000. in addition, the maximum tender amount with respect to the 2020 notes has been increased from $200,000,000 to $300,000,000 principal amount, subject to further increase or decrease by the company, and the financing condition has been increased from $500,000,000 to $750,000,000 in gross proceeds, subject to the terms and conditions of the offer to purchase.


Noble Holding International Limited Announces Pricing of Offering of Senior Notes
Dec 14 16
Noble Corporation plc ("Noble") announced that its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited ("NHIL"), has priced an offering of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.750% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"). Noble Corporation ("Noble-Cayman"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Noble, will fully and unconditionally guarantee the 2024 notes on a senior unsecured basis. NHIL intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $970,100,000, together with cash on hand, to pay the purchase price and accrued interest (together with fees and expenses) in the tender offers (the "tender offers") to purchase for cash up to $750,000,000 aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued interest, of NHIL's 4.90% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), 4.625% senior notes due 2021 and 3.95% senior notes due 2022. If the tender offers, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, including a $300,000,000 cap with respect to the 2020 notes and the completion of the offering of the 2024 Notes for gross proceeds of at least $750,000,000, are not consummated, or the aggregate purchase price of the notes tendered in the tender offers and accepted for payment is less than the net proceeds of the 2024 notes offering, NHIL will use the remainder of those proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the further retirement of debt, including the purchase of debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The 2024 notes offering is expected to close on December 28, 2016. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., DNB Markets Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as the joint book-running managers.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
