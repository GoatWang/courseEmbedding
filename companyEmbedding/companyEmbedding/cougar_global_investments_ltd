Company Description


Cougar Global Investments seeks to generate the compounded annualized growth rate that achieves each client’s investment objectives. The firm employs a growth-focused investment approach in which dealing with uncertainty is based on empirical research on both capital market behavior and on the true nature of risk. The firm is averse to downside risk, but is willing to accept volatility to the upside. When seeking the optimal aset class mix, Cougar Global looks for the highest possible returns while constraining the mix to a pre-determined probability of downside risk given their Multiple Economic Scenario (MES) analysis.Each month, Cougar Global updates multiple global economic scenarios using a one-year forecast horizon. Probabilities are developed for 5 macroeconomic scenarios: growth, stagnation, recession, inflation and chaos (black swans). Research, analysis and modeling of the probabilities are conducted such that the consensus attaches to each scenario. Then independent macroeconomic and capital market research is used to develop probabilities for each scenario.Cougar Global uses an advanced historical statistical sampling technique to estimate what could happen in the future to the capital markets. Over 20 global asset classes are modeled, but fewer than 10 typically enter the portfolios. Each month, they store the historical monthly return data and the correlations for each asset class according to the 5 macroeconomic scenarios. They weight the historical return data using the current forward-looking MES and “bootstrap” data to generate the probability distributions for the returns of each asset class. They probability-weight correlations for each asset class using the current forward-looking MES.Portfolios are optimized by constraining each mandate to have exposure to a specific level of downside risk. Constraint may be relaxed on downside risk to position each mandate to achieve a higher return. Cougar Global may use ETFs to implement each mandate’s asset mix in a globally diversified portfolio.

Firm History
Cougar Global Investments Limited was founded in 1993 by Dr. James Breech, President and CEO who had devoted the previous 12 years to developing the Cougar Global investment management platform. Cougar Global provides investment counseling services to all types of accounts — private clients, RRSPs, trusts, foundations, donor-directed charities, corporate and institutional accounts. Cougar Global offers clients integrated wealth management services.
Cougar Global has developed a proprietary investment process that constructs globally diversified portfolios of ETFs designed to perform in accordance with clients’ investment objectives.  The firm’s investment process employs downside risk management methodology and tactical asset allocation to protect client’s assets in down markets.
Effective 4/30/15 Cougar Global was acquired by Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE:RJF) and became an affiliate of Eagle Asset Management, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc. 
Investment Philosophy
Cougar Global is a tactical asset manager with a focus on downside risk management. The goal of investing, Cougar Global believes, is to achieve compound annualized returns that meet the client’s investment objective. Cougar Global adheres to a strict discipline of downside risk management, and strives to participate in bull markets while mitigating or avoiding, if possible, the downside in bear markets.
Cougar Global performs ongoing research regarding the behaviour of about 20 global asset classes in order to determine how they will behave under various macroeconomic scenarios using our proprietary Multiple Economic Scenario (MES) methodology.
Cougar Global invests using only Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the index returns for each global asset class. ETFs result in lower fees, lower trading costs, and increased tax efficiency.
Cougar Global constructs four mandates based on the investor’s risk tolerance and investment goals. The “GTS”  stands for Global Tactical Strategy. 
GTS with Income: Suitable for clients who make monthly regular withdrawals for income
GTS with Conservative Growth: Suitable for clients who require at most annual withdrawals for income
GTS with Moderate Growth: Suitable for clients who want to achieve moderately high investment returns
GTS with Growth: Suitable for clients who want to achieve high investment returns over a long-term horizon
Wealth Management Services
Cougar Global has a knowledgeable client service team who provide full financial planning services incorporating retirement, tax and estate issues acknowledging the role of trusts or corporations. They frequently work with outside professionals regarding legal and tax issues.
Reporting & Communication with Clients
Clients receive quarterly statements which include a personalized overview letter from the Chief Investment Officer.
Safeguarding of Investor Assets
RBC Investor Services clears, settles trades, and holds all client assets in safekeeping. RBC Investor Services provides quarterly independent reporting to Cougar Global clients.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Effective 4/30/15 Cougar Global was acquired by Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE:RJF)  and in 2016 became an affiliate of Carillion Tower Advisers, Inc.  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc.  Prior to 4/30/15 Cougar Global was an independent investment management firm not affiliated with any parent organization.

LPL Financial will then have full discretion to invest the MWP account in accordance with the model and to select other investments. LPL Financial may deviate from the model provided. The composites aggregate accounts for which Cougar Global has discretion. In MWP, LPL Financial (and not Cougar Global) has discretion. These and other factors will result in MWP account performance being different than that of the composite. The performance information for the composite is presented solely to provide information about investment models that will be provided by Cougar Global according to the same fundamental strategies shown.
For a list of composite descriptions, policies for valuing portfolios and calculating performance or to obtain a copy of a GIPS compliant presentation, please contact Cougar at 1 800 387 3779.
Cougar Global Investments claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).
Past performance is not an indicator of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted. To obtain current month-end exchange traded fund performance information, please contact your financial advisor.
The volatility of the benchmark used to compare is materially different from that of the Composites. The potential for profit is accompanied by the potential of loss.
Neither LPL Financial nor Cougar Global Investments nor any of its affiliates engage in investment banking services nor has LPL Financial nor Cougar Global Investments or its affiliates or the analyst(s) been compensated during the previous 12 months by any company mentioned in this report for any non-investment banking securities-related services and non-securities services nor has any company mentioned been a client of LPL Financial or Cougar Global Investments or its affiliates within the past 12 months.
Principal Risk: An investment in Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), structured as a mutual fund or unit investment trust, involves the risk of losing money and should be considered as part of an overall program, not a complete investment program.

Cougar Global Investments  » Investment Management » Process



Process
 

Cougar Global has developed a unique approach to global investing based on its Multiple Economic Scenario Outlook (MES), using a one year forecast horizon.
The investment process incorporates leading edge research into the behaviour of capital markets and global asset classes in order to determine how they will behave under various macroeconomic scenarios.
The first step is to research, analyze and model the probabilities that the consensus attaches to each scenario (rational beliefs).
The second step is to establish Cougar Global’s own probabilities for each scenario, based on its own research, obtained from independent macroeconomic, capital market and geopolitical research services (Cougar Global’s MES).
The third step is to generate probability distributions for the returns of each asset class over the next year (an advanced statistical sampling technique where the computer randomly samples the data for each scenario).  The data is then “bootstrapped” and then weighted according to Cougar Global’s Multiple Economic Scenario Analysis.  This provides Cougar Global with a measure for how these asset classes would behave under the forecast scenarios.
The results are then entered into the proprietary portfolio optimizer in order to generate the optimal asset mix for each mandate, for that month.  This is when we incorporate downside risk management techniques to control risk levels for each portfolio.  Portfolios are revised monthly and rebalanced if the expected returns and downside risk for the current mix have shifted.
For more details about the Multiple-economic Scenarios, please see “5 Macroeconomic Scenarios”.

Philosophy
 

The goal of investing, Cougar Global believes, is to achieve compound annualized returns that meet the client’s investment objectives.  The primary means of achieving high compound growth rates is to avoid losing money.  In order to achieve this objective, Cougar Global’s investment philosophy is to participate in bull markets and avoid bear markets.  Cougar Global is a tactical asset allocator, and has been 97% equities or 100% fixed income and money market in the period when believed it was appropriate.
Cougar Global shares with the vast majority of retail investors (and very few academics) an “asymmetric attitude toward risk”.  Cougar Global attempts to avoid downside risk, but is quite willing to accept the “risk” of upside opportunities.
