Prospectus

March 27, 1995                                                                  

Pioneer International Growth Fund (the "Fund") seeks long-term growth of capital
by investing in a portfolio consisting primarily of foreign equity securities   
and of Depositary Receipts for such securities. Any current income generated    
from these securities is incidental to the investment objective of the Fund. The
Fund is a diversified open-end investment company designed for investors seeking
to achieve capital growth and diversification through foreign investments. There
is, of course, no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.

The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in
equity and equity-related securities of companies organized and domiciled in    
countries other than the United States, which securities are considered by the  
Fund's investment adviser to offer the potential for long-term growth of        
capital. The Fund expects to employ certain active management techniques in     
order to hedge the foreign currency and other risks associated with the Fund's  
investments. The Fund may invest without limit in both emerging and established 
markets. Emerging markets may offer significant investment opportunities but may
also involve speculative risks.                                                 

Fund returns and share prices fluctuate and the value of your account upon      
redemption may be more or less than your purchase price. Shares in the Fund are 
not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank or other 
depository institution, and the shares are not federally insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or any other government
agency. Investments in foreign securities, particularly in emerging markets,    
entail risks in addition to those customarily associated with investing in U.S. 
securities. The Fund is intended for investors who can accept the risks         
associated with its investments and may not be suitable for all investors. See  
"Investment Objective and Policies" for a discussion of these risks.            

This Prospectus (Part A of the Registration Statement) provides information     
about the Fund that you should know before investing. Please read and retain it 
for your future reference. More information about the Fund is included in the   
Statement of Additional Information (Part B of the Registration Statement), also
dated March 27, 1995, which is incorporated into this Prospectus by reference. A
copy of the Statement of Additional Information may be obtained free of charge  
by calling Shareholder Services at 1-800-225-6292 or by written request to the  
Fund at 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109. Additional information    
about the Fund has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  
"SEC") and is available upon request and without charge.

This table is designed to help you understand the charges and expenses that you,
as a shareholder, will bear directly or indirectly when you invest in the Fund. 
The table reflects estimated annual operating expenses, based upon actual       
expenses for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1994.

Total Operating Expenses                                   1.95%    3.02%  

(1) Purchases of $1,000,000 or more and purchases by participants in certain    
group plans are not subject to an initial sales charge but may be subject to a  
contingent deferred sales charge.                                               

(2) Separate fees (currently $10 and $20, respectively) apply to domestic and   
international bank wire transfers of redemption proceeds.                       

(3) For Class B shares, percentages are based on estimated expenses that would  
have been incurred during the previous period had Class B shares been           
outstanding for the entire period.                                              

Example:                                                                        
You would pay the following dollar amounts on a $1,000 investment, assuming a   
5% annual return and redemption at the end of each time period:                 

                                                                [Download Table]

Class A Shares                  $76         $115         $157          $ 272 
Class B Shares

 --Assuming no redemption       $31         $ 93         $ 159         $310* 

*Class B shares convert to Class A shares eight years after purchase; therefore,
Class A expenses are used after year eight.                                     

The example above assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions and   
that the percentage amounts listed under "Annual Operating Expenses" remain the 
same each year.                                                                 

The example is designed for information purposes only, and should not be        
considered a representation of past or future expenses or return. Actual Fund   
expenses and return vary from year to year and may be higher or lower than those
shown.                                                                          

For further information regarding management fees, 12b-1 fees and other expenses
of the Fund, including information regarding the basis upon which fees and      
expenses are reduced or reallocated, see "Management of the Fund," "Distribution
Plans" and "How to Buy Fund Shares" in this Prospectus and "Management of the   
Fund" and "Underwriting Agreement and Distribution Plans" in the Statement of   
Additional Information. The Fund's payment of a 12b-1 fee may result in         
long-term shareholders indirectly paying more than the economic equivalent of   
the maximum initial sales charge permitted under the Rules of Fair Practice of  
the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. ("NASD").                   

The maximum initial sales charge is reduced on purchases of specified larger    
amounts of Class A shares and the value of shares owned in other Pioneer mutual 
funds is taken into account in determining the applicable initial sales charge.

III. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                          
The Fund's investment objective is long-term growth of capital. The Fund pursues
this objective by investing in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of  
the equity and equity-related securities of companies that are organized and    
have principal offices in foreign countries ("Foreign Companies") and Depositary
Receipts for securities of such companies. There can be no assurance that the   
Fund will achieve its objective.                                                

Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund's total assets are invested
in equity securities consisting of common stock and securities with common stock
characteristics, such as preferred stock, warrants and debt securities          
convertible into common stock and American Depositary Receipts for such         
securities ("Equity Securities"). Pioneering Management Corporation (the        
"Manager") currently intends to focus on securities of issuers located in such  
countries as Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Singapore, the United Kingdom and the other developed countries of Western      
Europe as well as the countries with emerging markets listed in "Investments in
Emerging Markets." The Fund may also invest up to 20% of its total assets in    
Other Eligible Investments (as defined below), consisting of money market and   
fixed-income securities, and may employ certain other active management         
techniques. Certain of these techniques may be used in an attempt to hedge      
foreign currency and other risks associated with the Fund's investments. These  
techniques include purchasing options on securities indices, entering into      
forward foreign currency exchange contracts, purchasing options on foreign      
currencies, entering into futures contracts on securities indices and           
currencies, purchasing and selling options on such futures contracts, and       
lending portfolio securities. The Fund may also enter into repurchase agreements
and invest in restricted and illiquid securities. See the Appendix to this      
Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information for a description of     
these investment practices and securities and associated risks.                 

As to any specific investment in Equity Securities, the Manager's analysis will 
focus on evaluating the fundamental value of an enterprise. The Fund will       
purchase securities for its portfolio when their market price appears to be less
than their fundamental value in the judgment of the Manager. In selecting       
specific investments, the Manager will attempt to identify securities with      
strong potential for appreciation relative to their downside exposure. In this  
regard the Manager will also use a macro-analysis of numerous economic and      
valuation variables to determine the anticipated investment climate in specific 
countries.                                                                      

In making these determinations, the Manager will take into account              
price-earnings ratios, cash flow, the relationship of asset value to market     
price of the securities and other factors which it may determine from time to   
time to be relevant. Because current income is not the Fund's investment        
objective, the Fund will not restrict its investments in Equity Securities to   
those of issuers with a record of timely dividend payments.                     

While investing in foreign Equity Securities involves certain risks, as         
discussed below, the Manager believes such investments offer opportunities for  
capital growth and diversification. Today, more than two-thirds of the world's  
stock market value is traded on markets outside the United States. Investing    
overseas can help diversify a portfolio otherwise invested solely in U.S.       
securities. Foreign stock and bond markets often do not parallel the performance
of U.S. markets, which means that, over time, diversifying investments across   
several countries can help reduce portfolio volatility. Under normal            
circumstances at least 65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in       
securities of companies domiciled in at least three different foreign countries.

Risk Factors                                                                    
Investing in the securities of Foreign Companies and foreign governments        
involves certain considerations and risks which are not typically associated    
with investing in securities of domestic companies and the United States        
government. In many foreign countries, issuers are not subject to uniform       
accounting, auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to     
those applicable to United States companies. Also in many foreign countries,    
there is less government supervision and regulation of foreign securities       
exchanges, brokers and listed companies than exists in the United States.       
Interest and dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and
other foreign taxes which will decrease the net return on such investments as   
compared to interest and dividends paid to a fund by domestic companies or by   
the U.S. government.                                                            

In addition, the value of foreign securities may also be adversely affected by  
fluctuations in the relative rates of exchange between the currencies of        
different nations and by exchange control regulations. The Fund's investment    
performance may be significantly affected, either positively or negatively, by  
currency exchange rates because the U.S. dollar value of securities denominated 
in a foreign currency will increase or decrease in response to changes in the   
value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. There may also be   
less publicly available information about Foreign Companies compared to reports 
and ratings published about U.S. companies. Some foreign securities markets     
generally have substantially less trading volume than domestic markets and      
securities of some Foreign Companies are less liquid and more volatile than     
securities of comparable U.S. companies.                                        

Brokerage commissions in foreign countries are generally fixed, and other       
transaction costs related to securities exchanges are generally higher than in  
the United States. Most foreign Equity Securities of the Fund are held by       
foreign subcustodians that satisfy certain eligibility requirements. However,   
foreign subcustodian arrangements are significantly more expensive than domestic
custody. In addition, foreign settlement of securities transactions is subject  
to local law and custom that is not, generally, as well established or as       
reliable as U.S. regulation and custom applicable to settlements of securities  
transactions and, accordingly, there is generally perceived to be a greater risk
of loss in connection with securities transactions in many foreign countries.   

Additionally, in some foreign countries, there is the possibility of            
expropriation, nationalization or confiscation of assets and property,          
limitations on the removal of securities, property or other assets of the Fund, 
political or social instability, or diplo-                                      

P-->485BPOS8th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
matic developments which could affect U.S. investments in those countries.      
The Manager will take these factors into consideration in managing the Fund's   
investments.                                                                    

Investment in Japan and the United Kingdom                                      
The Fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in the securities of      
corporate issuers located in each of Japan and the United Kingdom and more than 
25% of the Fund's total assets, adjusted to reflect currency transactions and   
positions, may be denominated in the Japanese yen and the British pound.        
Investment of a substantial portion of the Fund's assets in such countries or   
currencies will subject the Fund to the risks of adverse securities markets,    
exchange rates and social, political or economic events which may occur in those
countries.                                                                      

Investments in Emerging Markets                                                 
The Fund may invest without limitation in securities of issuers located in      
countries with emerging economies or securities markets, but will not invest    
more than 25% of its total assets in securities of issuers located in any one   
such country. Countries with emerging economies or securities markets include:  
Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt,   
Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, South Korea, 
Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa,
Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Political and      
economic structures in many of such countries may be undergoing significant     
evolution and rapid development, and such countries may lack the social,        
political and economic stability characteristic of more developed countries. As 
a result, the risks described above relating to investments in foreign          
securities, including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets,  
may be heightened. In addition, unanticipated political or social developments  
may affect the values of the Fund's investments and the availability to the Fund
of additional investments in such countries. The small size and inexperience of 
the securities markets in certain of such countries and the limited volume of   
trading in securities in those countries may make the Fund's investments in such
countries less liquid and more volatile than investments in countries with more 
developed securities markets (such as Japan or most Western European countries).

Investments in Depositary Receipts                                              
The Fund may hold securities of foreign issuers in the form of American         
Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs") and other     
similar instruments or other securities convertible into securities of eligible 
issuers. Generally, ADRs in registered form are designed for use in U.S.        
securities markets, and GDRs and other similar global instruments in bearer form
are designed for use in non-U.S. securities markets.                            

ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and represent an interest in the right to  
receive securities of foreign issuers deposited in a U.S. bank or correspondent 
bank. ADRs do not eliminate all the risk inherent in investing in the securities
of non-U.S. issuers. However, by investing in ADRs rather than directly in      
equity securities of non-U.S. issuers, the Fund will avoid currency risks during
the settlement period for either purchases or sales. GDRs are not necessarily   
denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities which they        
represent. For purposes of the Fund's investment policies, investments in ADRs, 
GDRs and similar instruments will be deemed to be investments in the underlying 
equity securities of the foreign issuers. The Fund may acquire depositary       
receipts from banks that do not have a contractual relationship with the issuer 
of the security underlying the depositary receipt to issue and secure such      
depositary receipt. To the extent the Fund invests in such unsponsored          
depositary receipts there may be an increased possibility that the Fund may not 
become aware of events affecting the underlying security and thus the value of  
the related depositary receipt. In addition, certain benefits (i.e., rights     
offerings) which may be associated with the security underlying the depositary  
receipt may not inure to the benefit of the holder of such depositary receipt.  

Other Eligible Investments                                                      
The Fund's Other Eligible Investments consist of: (a) corporate commercial      
paper and other short-term commercial obligations, in each case rated or issued 
by foreign or domestic companies with similar securities outstanding that are   
rated Prime-1, Aa or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), or  
A-1, AA or better by Standard and Poor's Ratings Group ("Standard and Poor's"); 
(b) obligations (including certificates of deposit, time deposits, demand       
deposits and bankers' acceptances) of banks (located in the United States or    
foreign countries) with securities outstanding that are rated Prime-1, Aa or    
better by Moody's, or A-1, AA or better by Standard and Poor's; (c) obligations 
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or the government of a foreign      
country or their respective agencies or instrumentalities; (d) fixed-income     
securities of foreign or domestic companies which are rated, at the time of     
investment, within the top four grades by the major rating services (Moody's    
"Baa" or higher, Standard and Poor's "BBB" or higher) or, if unrated, judged to 
be of comparable quality by the Manager; and (e) repurchase agreements. These   
securities may be denominated in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies. In the  
event that the credit quality of a security falls below investment grade        
subsequent to purchase, the Fund may nevertheless retain such security as long  
as the Manager determines it is advisable to do so. However, at no time may the 
Fund have more than 5% of its net assets invested in fixed-income securities    
rated below investment grade. Securities rated "Baa" or "BBB" and securities of 
comparable quality may have speculative characteristics and changes in economic 
conditions or other circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity
to make principal and interest payments than is the case with higher grade debt 
securities.                                                                     

The Fund may on occasion, for temporary defensive purposes to preserve capital, 
invest up to 100% of its total assets in Other Eligible Investments except that 
when the Fund assumes a defensive posture, it will not invest in fixed-income   
securities of foreign or domestic companies rated below A by Moody's or Standard
& Poor's, or if unrated, judged to be of comparable credit quality by the       
Manager. The Fund will assume a temporary defensive posture only when political 
and economic factors affect foreign equity markets to such an extent that the   
Manager believes there to be extraordinary risks in being substantially invested
in foreign Equity Securities.

Lending of Portfolio Securities                                                 
The Fund may also seek to earn additional income by lending its portfolio       
securities. Under present regulatory policies, such loans may be made to        
institutions, such as certain broker-dealers, and are required to be secured    
continuously by collateral in cash, cash equivalents or U.S. government         
securities maintained on a current basis at an amount at least equal to the     
market value of the securities loaned. If the Manager decides to make securities
loans, the value of the securities loaned would not exceed 33-1/3% of the value 
of the total assets of the Fund. See "Investment Policy and Restrictions" in the
Statement of Additional Information. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in 
the recovery of its securities if the institution with which it has engaged in a
portfolio securities loan transaction breaches its agreement with the Fund.     

Certain Other Investment Techniques                                             
As noted above, the Fund may purchase put and call options on securities        
indices, purchase put and call options on currencies, enter into forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and enter into futures contracts on indices and     
currencies and purchase and sell options on such futures contracts. These       
techniques may be employed in an attempt to hedge currency or other risks       
associated with the Fund's portfolio securities. While the successful use of    
these techniques may reduce or eliminate certain risks, these techniques also   
involve transaction costs as well as risks. These risks include the risk that   
contractual positions once entered may not be easily closed out on a particular 
market, the risk that the attempted hedge may be ineffective because changes in 
the value of a hedged position may not correlate to the securities market or    
currency being hedged and the risk that an incorrect prediction by the Manager  
in the movement of securities prices or exchange rates may cause the Fund to    
perform less well if the hedge had not been attempted. See the Appendix for a   
further description of these techniques and associated risks.                   

Portfolio Turnover                                                              
The Manager avoids market-timing or speculating on broad market fluctuations.   
Therefore, except as described above, the Fund is substantially fully invested  
at all times. A high rate of portfolio turnover (100% or more) involves         
correspondingly greater transaction costs which must be borne by the Fund and   
its shareholders and may, under certain circumstances, make it more difficult   
for the Fund to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal    
Revenue Code. See "Dividends, Distributions and Taxation." Changes in the       
portfolio may be made promptly when determined to be advisable by reason of     
developments not foreseen at the time of the initial investment decision, and   
usually without reference to the length of time a security has been held.       
Accordingly, portfolio turnover rates are not considered a limiting factor in   
the execution of investment decisions.                                          

The Fund's investment objective and certain investment restrictions designated  
as fundamental in the Statement of Additional Information may be changed by the 
Board of Trustees only with shareholder approval.                               

IV. MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND                                                      
The Fund's Board of Trustees has overall responsibility for management and      
supervision of the Fund. There are currently eight Trustees, six of whom are not
"interested persons" of the Fund as defined in the Investment Company Act of    
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Board meets at least quarterly. By virtue
of the functions performed by Pioneering Management Corporation as investment   
adviser, the Fund requires no employees other than its executive officers, all  
of whom receive their compensation from the Manager or other sources. The       
Statement of Additional Information contains the names and general business and 
professional background of each Trustee and executive officer of the Fund.      

The Fund is managed under a contract with the Manager, which serves as          
investment adviser to the Fund and is responsible for the overall management of 
the Fund's business affairs, subject only to the authority of the Board of      
Trustees. The Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Pioneer Group, Inc.   
("PGI"), a Delaware corporation. Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc. ("PFD"), a     
wholly-owned subsidiary of PGI, is the principal underwriter of shares of the   
Fund. John F. Cogan, Jr., Chairman and President of the Fund, Chairman and a    
Director of the Manager, Chairman of PFD, and President and a Director of PGI,  
beneficially owned approximately 15% of the outstanding capital stock of PGI as 
of the date of this Prospectus.                                                 

Each international equity portfolio managed by the Manager, including the Fund, 
is overseen by an Equity Committee, which consists of the Manager's most senior 
equity professionals, and a Portfolio Management Committee, which consists of   
PMC's international equity portfolio managers. Both committees are chaired by   
Mr. David Tripple, the Manager's President and Chief Investment Officer and     
Executive Vice President of each of the Pioneer mutual funds. Mr. Tripple joined
the Manager in 1974 and has had general responsibility for the Manager's        
investment operations and specific portfolio assignments for over five years.   

Day-to-day management of the Fund is the responsibility of Dr. Norman           
Kurland, Vice President of the Fund and of the Manager. Dr. Kurland joined      
the Manager in 1990 after working with a variety of investment and industrial   
concerns.                                                                       

In addition to the Fund, the Manager also manages and serves as the investment  
adviser for other mutual funds and is an investment adviser to certain other    
institutional accounts. The Manager's and PFD's executive offices are located at
60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.                                   

Under the terms of its contract with the Fund, the Manager assists in the       
management of the Fund and is authorized in its discretion to buy and sell      
securities for the account of the Fund. The Manager pays all the ordinary       
operating expenses, including executive salaries and the rental of office space 
relating to its services for the Fund with the exception of the following which 
are to be paid by the Fund: (a) taxes and other governmental charges, if any;   
(b) interest on borrowed money, if any; (c) legal fees and expenses; (d)        
auditing fees; (e) insurance premiums; (f) dues and fees for membership in trade
associations; (g) fees and expenses of registering and maintaining registrations
by the Fund of its shares with the SEC, individual states, territories and      
foreign jurisdictions and of preparing reports to government agencies; (h) fees 
and expenses of Trustees not affiliated with or interested per-                 

P-->485BPOS10th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
sons of the Manager; (i) fees and expenses of the custodian, dividend disbursing
agent, transfer agent and registrar; (j) issue and transfer taxes chargeable to 
the Fund in connection with securities transactions to which the Fund is a      
party; (k) costs of reports to shareholders, shareholders' meetings and         
Trustees' meetings; (l) the cost of certificates representing shares of the     
Fund; (m) bookkeeping and appraisal charges; and (n) distribution fees in       
accordance with Rule 12b-1. The Fund also pays all brokerage commissions in     
connection with its portfolio transactions.                                     

Orders for the Fund's portfolio securities transactions are placed by the       
Manager, which strives to obtain the best price and execution for each          
transaction. In circumstances in which two or more broker-dealers are in a      
position to offer comparable prices and execution, consideration may be given to
whether the broker-dealer provides investment research or brokerage services or 
sells shares of any Pioneer mutual fund. See the Statement of Additional        
Information for a further description of the Manager's brokerage allocation     
practices.                                                                      

As compensation for its management services and certain expenses which the      
Manager incurs, the Manager is entitled to a management fee equal to 1.00% per  
annum of the Fund's average daily net assets up to $300 million, 0.85% of the   
next $200 million and .75% of the excess over $500 million. The fee is normally 
computed daily and paid monthly. The management fee paid by the Fund is greater 
than those paid by most funds. Due to the added complexity of managing funds    
with an international investment strategy, however, management fees for         
international funds tend to be higher than those paid by most funds.            

During the fiscal year ended November 30, 1994, the Fund incurred expenses of   
$4,472,536, including management fees paid or payable to the Manager of         
$2,256,822.                                                                     

V. FUND SHARE ALTERNATIVES                                                      
The Fund continuously offers two Classes of shares designated as Class A and    
Class B shares, as described more fully in "How to Buy Fund Shares." If you do  
not specify in your instructions to the Fund which Class of shares you wish to  
purchase, exchange or redeem, the Fund will assume that your instructions apply 
to Class A shares.                                                              

Class A Shares. If you invest less than $1 million in Class A shares, you will  
pay an initial sales charge. Certain purchases may qualify for reduced initial  
sales charges. If you invest $1 million or more in Class A shares, no sales     
charge will be imposed at the time of purchase. However, shares redeemed within 
12 months of purchase may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge      
("CDSC"). Class A shares are subject to distribution and service fees at a      
combined annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets      
attributable to Class A shares.                                                 

Class B Shares. If you plan to invest up to $250,000, Class B shares are        
available to you. Class B shares are sold without an initial sales charge, but  
are subject to a CDSC of up to 4% if redeemed within six years. Class B shares  
are subject to distribution and service fees at a combined annual rate of 1.00% 
of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class B shares. Your     
entire investment in Class B shares is available to work for you from the time  
you make your investment, but the higher distribution fee paid by Class B shares
will cause your Class B shares (until conversion) to have a higher expense ratio
and to pay lower dividends, to the extent dividends are paid, than Class A      
shares. Class B shares will automatically convert to Class A shares, based on   
relative net asset value, eight years after the initial purchase.               

Purchasing Class A or Class B Shares. The decision as to which Class to purchase
depends on the amount you invest, the intended length of the investment and your
personal situation. If you are making an investment that qualifies for reduced  
sales charges, you might consider Class A shares. If you prefer not to pay an   
initial sales charge on an investment of $250,000 or less and you plan to hold  
the investment for at least six years, you might consider Class B shares.       

Investment dealers or their representatives may receive different compensation  
depending on which Class of shares they sell. Shares may be exchanged only for  
shares of the same Class of another Pioneer mutual fund and shares acquired in  
the exchange will continue to be subject to any CDSC applicable to shares of the
Fund originally purchased. Shares sold outside the U.S. to persons who are not  
U.S. citizens may be subject to different sales charges, CDSCs and dealer       
compensation arrangements in accordance with local laws and business practices. 

VI. SHARE PRICE                                                                 
Shares of the Fund are sold at the public offering price, which is the net asset
value per share plus any applicable sales charge. Net asset value per share of a
Class of the Fund is determined by dividing the fair market value of its assets,
less liabilities attributable to that Class, by the number of shares of that    
Class outstanding. The net asset value is computed once daily, on each day the  
New York Stock Exchange (the "Exchange") is open, as of the close of regular    
trading on the Exchange.                                                        

Securities are valued at the last sale price on the principal exchange or market
where they are traded. Securities which have not traded on the date of          
valuation, or securities for which sales prices are not generally reported, are 
valued at the mean between the current bid and asked prices. Securities quoted  
in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars utilizing foreign exchange  
rates employed by the Fund's independent pricing services. Generally, trading in
foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to
the close of regular trading on the Exchange. The values of such securities used
in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of such 
times. Foreign currency exchange rates are also generally determined prior to   
the close of regular trading on the Exchange. Occasionally, events which affect 
the values of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between the     
times at which they are determined and the close of regular trading on the      
Exchange and will therefore not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's   
net asset value. If events materially affecting the value of such securities    
occur during such period, then these securities are valued at their fair value  
as determined in good faith by the Trustees. All assets of the Fund for which   
there is no other readily available valuation                                   

P-->485BPOS11th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
method are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the        
Trustees.                                                                       

VII. HOW TO BUY FUND SHARES                                                     
You may buy Fund shares at the public offering price from any securities        
broker-dealer which has a sales agreement with PFD. If you do not have a        
securities broker-dealer, please call 1-800-225-6292 for assistance.            

The minimum initial investment is $1,000 for Class A and Class B shares except  
as specified below. The minimum initial investment is $50 for Class A accounts  
being established to utilize monthly bank drafts, government allotments, payroll
deduction and other similar automatic investment plans. Separate minimum        
investment requirements apply to retirement plans and to telephone and wire     
orders placed by broker-dealers; no sales charges or minimum requirements apply 
to the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions. The minimum    
subsequent investment is $50 for Class A shares and $500 for Class B shares     
except that the subsequent minimum investment amount for Class B share accounts 
may be as little as $50 if an automatic investment plan (see "Automatic
Investment Plans") is established.                                              

Class A Shares                                                                  
You may buy Class A shares at the public offering price, that is, at the net    
asset value per share next computed after receipt of a purchase order, plus a   
sales charge as follows:

No sales charge is payable at the time of purchase on investments of $1,000,000 
or more or for participants in certain group plans (described below) subject to 
a CDSC of 1% which may be imposed in the event of a redemption of Class A shares
within 12 months of purchase. See "How to Sell Fund Shares." PFD may, in its    
discretion, pay a commission to broker-dealers who initiate and are responsible 
for such purchases as follows: 1% on the first $1 million invested; 0.50% on the
next $4 million; and 0.10% on the excess over $5 million. These commissions will
not be paid if the purchaser is affiliated with the broker-dealer or if the     
purchase represents the reinvestment of a redemption made during the previous 12
calendar months. Broker-dealers who receive a commission in connection with     
Class A share purchases at net asset value by 401(a) or 401(k) retirement plans 
with 1,000 or more eligible participants or with at least $10 million in plan   
assets will be required to return any commission paid or a pro rata portion     
thereof if the retirement plan redeems its shares within 12 months of purchase. 
See "How to Sell Fund Shares." In connection with PGI's acquisition of Mutual of
Omaha Fund Management Company and contingent upon the achievement of certain    
sales objectives, PFD pays to Mutual of Omaha Investor Services, Inc. 50% of    
PFD's retention of any sales commission on sales of the Fund's Class A shares   
through such dealer.                                                            

The schedule of sales charges above is applicable to purchases of Class A shares
of the Fund by an (i) an individual, (ii) an individual and his or her spouse   
and children under the age of 21 and (iii) a trustee or other fiduciary of a    
trust estate or fiduciary account or related trusts or accounts including       
pension, profit-sharing and other employee benefit trusts qualified under       
Section 401 or 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the        
"Code"), although more than one beneficiary is involved. The sales charges      
applicable to a current purchase of Class A shares of the Fund by a person      
listed above is determined by adding the value of shares to be purchased to the 
aggregate value (at the then current offering price) of shares of any of the    
other Pioneer mutual funds previously purchased (except direct purchases of     
Pioneer Money Market Trust's Class A shares) and then owned, provided PFD is    
notified by such person or his or her broker-dealer each time a purchase is made
which would qualify. Pioneer mutual funds include all mutual funds for which PFD
serves as principal underwriter. See the "Letter of Intention" section of the   
Account Application.                                                            

Qualifying for a Reduced Sales Charge. Class A shares of the Fund may be sold at
a reduced or eliminated sales charge to certain group plans ("Group Plans")     
under which a sponsoring organization makes recommendations to, permits group   
solicitation of, or otherwise facilitates purchases by, its employees, members  
or participants. Information about such arrangements is available from PFD.     

Class A shares of the Fund may be sold at net asset value per share without a   
sales charge to: (a) current or former Trustees and officers of the Fund and    
partners and employees of its legal counsel; (b) current or former directors,   
officers, employees or sales representatives of PGI or its subsidiaries; (c)    
current or former directors, officers, employees or sales representatives of any
subadviser or predecessor investment adviser to any investment company for which
the Manager serves as investment adviser, and the subsidiaries or affiliates of 
such persons; (d) current or former officers, partners, employees or registered 
representatives of broker-dealers which have entered into sales agreements with 
PFD; (e) members of the immediate families of any of the persons above; (f) any 
trust, custodian, pension, profit-sharing or other benefit plan of the foregoing
persons; (g) insurance company separate accounts; (h) certain "wrap accounts"   
for the benefit of clients of financial planners adhering to standards          
established by PFD; (i) other funds and accounts for which the Manager or any of
its affiliates serves as investment adviser or manager; and (j) certain unit    
investment trusts. Shares so purchased are purchased for investment purposes and
may not be resold except through redemption or repurchase by or on behalf of the
Fund. The availability of this privilege is conditioned upon the receipt by PFD 
of written notification of eligibility. In addition, Class A shares of a Fund   
may be sold at net asset value per share without a sales                        

P-->485BPOS12th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
charge to Optional Retirement Program participants if (i) the employer has      
authorized a limited number of investment providers for the Program, (ii) all   
authorized providers offer their shares to Program participants at net asset    
value, (iii) the employer has agreed in writing to actively promote the         
authorized investment providers to Program participants and (iv) the Program    
provides for a matching contribution for each participant contribution. Shares  
may also be sold at net asset value in connection with certain reorganization,  
liquidation, or acquisition transactions involving other investment companies or
personal holding companies.                                                     

Reduced sales charges for Class A shares are available through an agreement to  
purchase a specified quantity of Fund shares over a designated 13-month period  
by completing the "Letter of Intention" section of the Account Application.     
Information about the Letter of Intention Procedure, including its terms, is    
contained in the Statement of Additional Information. Investors who are clients 
of a broker-dealer with a current sales agreement with PFD may purchase Class A 
shares of the Fund at net asset value, without a sales charge, to the extent    
that the purchase price is paid out of proceeds from one or more redemptions by 
the investor of shares of certain other mutual funds. In order for a purchase to
qualify for this privilege, the investor must document to the broker-dealer that
the redemption occurred within the 60 days immediately preceding the purchase of
shares of the Fund; that the client paid a sales charge on the original purchase
of the shares redeemed; and that the mutual fund whose shares were redeemed also
offers net asset value purchases to redeeming shareholders of any of the Pioneer
funds. Further details may be obtained from PFD.                                

Class B Shares                                                                  
You may buy Class B shares at net asset value without the imposition of an      
initial sales charge. However, Class B shares redeemed within six years of      
purchase will be subject to a CDSC at the rates shown in the table below. The   
charge will be assessed on the amount equal to the lesser of the current market 
value or the original purchase cost of the shares being redeemed. No CDSC will  
be imposed on increases in account value above the initial purchase price,      
including shares derived from the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains    
distributions.                                                                  

The amount of the CDSC, if any, will vary depending on the number of years from 
the time of purchase until the time of redemption of Class B shares. For the    
purpose of determining the number of years from the time of any purchase, all   
payments during a quarter will be aggregated and deemed to have been made on the
first day of that quarter. In processing redemptions of Class B shares, the Fund
will first redeem shares not subject to any CDSC, and then shares held longest  
during the six-year period. As a result, you will pay the lowest possible CDSC. 

                                                                [Download Table]

Proceeds from the CDSC are paid to PFD and are used in whole or in part to      
defray PFD's expenses related to providing distribution-related services to the 
Fund in connection with the sale of Class B shares, including the payment of    
compensation to broker-dealers.                                                 

Class B shares will automatically convert into Class A shares at the end of the 
calendar quarter that is eight years after the purchase date, except as noted   
below. Class B shares acquired by exchange from Class B shares of another       
Pioneer fund will convert into Class A shares based on the date of the initial  
purchase and the applicable CDSC. Class B shares acquired through reinvestment  
of distributions will convert into Class A shares based on the date of the      
initial purchase to which such shares relate. For this purpose, Class B shares  
acquired through reinvestment of distributions will be attributed to particular 
purchases of Class B shares in accordance with such procedures as the Trustees  
may determine from time to time. The conversion of Class B shares to Class A    
shares is subject to the continuing availability of a ruling from the Internal  
Revenue Service ("IRS"), which the Fund has obtained, or an opinion of counsel  
that such conversions will not constitute taxable events for federal tax        
purposes. There can be no assurance that such ruling will continue to be in     
effect at the time any particular conversion would occur. The conversion of     
Class B shares to Class A shares will not occur if such ruling is no longer in  
effect and such an opinion is not available and, therefore, Class B shares would
continue to be subject to higher expenses than Class A shares for an            
indeterminate period.                                                           

Waiver or Reduction of Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. The CDSC on Class B    
shares and on any Class A shares subject to a CDSC may be waived or reduced for 
non-retirement accounts if: (a) the redemption results from the death of all    
registered owners of an account (in the case of UGMAs, UTMAs and trust accounts,
waiver applies upon the death of all beneficial owners) or a total and permanent
disability (as defined in Section 72 of the Code) of all registered owners      
occurring after the purchase of the shares being redeemed or (b) the redemption 
is made in connection with limited automatic redemptions as set forth in        
"Systematic Withdrawal Plans" (limited in any year to 10% of the value of the   
account in the Fund at the time the withdrawal plan is established).            

The CDSC on Class B shares and on any Class A shares subject to a CDSC may be   
waived or reduced for retirement plan accounts if: (a) the redemption results   
from the death or a total and permanent disability (as defined in Section 72 of 
the Code) occurring after the purchase of the shares being redeemed of a        
shareholder or participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan; (b) the    
distribution is to a participant in an Individual Retirement Account ("IRA"),   
403(b) or employer-sponsored retirement plan, is part of a series of            
substantially equal payments made over the life expectancy of the participant or
the joint life expectancy of the participant                                    

P-->485BPOS13th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
and his or her beneficiary or as scheduled periodic payments to a participant   
(limited in any year to 10% of the value of the participant's account at the    
time the distribution amount is established; a required minimum distribution due
to the participant's attainment of age 70-1/2 may exceed the 10% limit only if  
the distribution amount is based on plan assets held by Pioneer); (c) the       
distribution is from a 401(a) or 401(k) retirement plan and is a return of      
excess employee deferrals or employee contributions or a qualifying hardship    
distribution as defined by the Code or results from a termination of employment 
(limited with respect to a termination to 10% per year of the value of the      
plan's assets in the Fund as of the later of the prior December 31 or the date  
the account was established unless the plan's assets are being rolled over to or
reinvested in the same class of shares of a Pioneer mutual fund subject to the  
CDSC of the shares originally held); (d) the distribution is from an IRA, 403(b)
or employer-sponsored retirement plan and is to be rolled over to or reinvested 
in the same class of shares in a Pioneer mutual fund and which will be subject  
to the applicable CDSC upon redemption; (e) the distribution is in the form of a
loan to a participant in a plan which permits loans (each repayment of the loan 
will constitute a new sale which will be subject to the applicable CDSC upon    
redemption); or (f) the distribution is from a qualified defined contribution   
plan and represents a participant's directed transfer (provided that this       
privilege has been pre-authorized through a prior agreement with PFD regarding  
participant directed transfers).                                                

The CDSC on Class B shares and on any Class A shares subject to a CDSC may be   
waived or reduced for either non- retirement or retirement plan accounts if: (a)
the redemption is made by any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality,   
department, authority, or agency thereof, which is prohibited by applicable laws
from paying a CDSC in connection with the acquisition of shares of any          
registered investment management company; or (b) the redemption is made pursuant
to the Fund's right to liquidate or involuntarily redeem shares in a            
shareholder's account.                                                          

Broker-Dealers. An order for either Class of Fund shares received by PFD from a 
broker-dealer prior to the close of regular trading on the Exchange is confirmed
at the price appropriate for that Class as determined at the close of regular   
trading on the Exchange on the day the order is received, provided the order is 
received prior to PFD's close of business (usually, 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time). It 
is the responsibility of broker-dealers to transmit orders so that they will be 
received by PFD prior to its close of business.                                 

General. The Fund reserves the right in its sole discretion to withdraw all or  
any part of the offering of shares when, in the judgment of the Fund's          
management, such withdrawal is in the best interest of the Fund. An order to    
purchase shares is not binding on, and may be rejected by, PFD until it has been
confirmed in writing by PFD and payment has been received.                      

VIII. HOW TO SELL FUND SHARES                                                   
You can arrange to sell (redeem) Fund shares on any day the Exchange is open by 
selling either some or all of your shares to the Fund.                          

You may sell your shares either through your broker-dealer or directly to the   
Fund. Please note the following:                                                

* If you are selling shares from a retirement account, you must make your       
request in writing (except for exchanges to other Pioneer mutual funds which    
can be requested by phone or in writing). Call 1-800-622-0176 for more          
information.                                                                    

* If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account, you may use any of   
the methods described below.                                                    

Your shares will be sold at the share price next calculated after your order is 
received and accepted less any applicable CDSC. Sale proceeds generally will be 
sent to you in cash, normally within seven days after your order is accepted.   
The Fund reserves the right to withhold payment of the sale proceeds until      
checks received by the Fund in payment for the shares being sold have cleared,  
which may take up to 15 calendar days from the purchase date.                   

In Writing. You may sell your shares by delivering a written request, signed by 
all registered owners, in good order to Pioneering Services Corporation ("PSC"),
however, you must use a written request, including a signature guarantee, to    
sell your shares if any of the following situations applies:                    

* you wish to sell over $50,000 worth of shares,                                

* your account registration or address has changed within the last 30 days,     

* the check is not being mailed to the address on your account (address of      
record),                                                                        

* the check is not being made out to the account owners, or                     

* the sale proceeds are being transferred to a Pioneer account with a different 
registration.                                                                   

Your request should include your name, the Fund's name, your fund account       
number, the Class of shares to be redeemed, the dollar amount or number of      
shares to be redeemed, and any other applicable requirements as described below.
Unless instructed otherwise, Pioneer will send the proceeds of the sale to the  
address of record. Fiduciaries or corporations are required to submit additional
documents. For more information, contact PSC at 1-800-225-6292.                 

Written requests will not be processed until they are received in good order and
accepted by PSC. Good order means that there are no outstanding claims or       
requests to hold redemptions on the account, certificates are endorsed by the   
record owner(s) exactly as the shares are registered and the signature(s) are   
guaranteed by an eligible guarantor. You should be able to obtain a signature   
guarantee from a bank, broker, dealer, credit union (if authorized under state  
law), securities exchange or association, clearing agency or savings            
association. A notary public cannot provide a signature guarantee. Signature    
guarantees are not accepted by facsimile ("fax"). For additional information    
about the necessary documentation for redemption by mail, please contact PSC at 
1-800-225-6292.                                                                 

By Telephone or by Fax.  Your account is automatically authorized to have the   
telephone redemption privilege unless you indicated otherwise on your Account   
Application or by                                                               

P-->485BPOS14th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
writing to PSC. Proper account identification will be required for each         
telephone redemption. The telephone redemption option is not available to       
retirement plan accounts. A maximum of $50,000 may be redeemed by telephone or  
fax and the proceeds may be received by check or by bank wire. To receive the   
proceeds by check: the check must be made payable exactly as the account is     
registered and the check must be sent to the address of record which must not   
have changed in the last 30 days. To receive the proceeds by bank wire: the wire
must be sent to the bank wire address of record which must have been properly   
pre-designated either on your Account Application or on an Account Options Form 
and which must not have changed in the last 30 days. To redeem by fax send your 
redemption request to 1-800-225- 4240. You may always elect to deliver          
redemption instructions to PSC by mail. See "Telephone Transactions and Related
Liabilities" below. Telephone and fax redemptions will be priced as described   
above.                                                                          

Selling Shares Through Your Broker-Dealer. The Fund has authorized PFD to act as
its agent in the repurchase of shares of the Fund from qualified broker-dealers 
and reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time. Your            
broker-dealer must receive your request before the close of business on the     
Exchange and transmit it to PFD before PFD's close of business to receive that  
day's redemption price. Your broker-dealer is responsible for providing all     
necessary documentation to PFD and may charge you for its services.             

Small Accounts. The minimum account value is $500. If you hold shares of the    
Fund in an account with a net asset value of less than the minimum required     
amount due to redemptions or exchanges, the Fund may redeem the shares held in  
this account at net asset value if you have not increased the net asset value of
the account to at least the minimum required amount within six months of notice 
by the Fund to you of the Fund's intention to redeem the shares.                

CDSC on Class A Shares. Purchases of Class A shares of $1,000,000 or more, or by
participants in a Group Plan which were not subject to an initial sales charge, 
may be subject to a CDSC upon redemption. A CDSC is payable to PFD on these     
investments in the event of a share redemption within 12 months following the   
share purchase, at the rate of 1% of the lesser of the value of the shares      
redeemed (exclusive of reinvested dividend and capital gain distributions) or   
the total cost of such shares. Shares subject to the CDSC which are exchanged   
into another Pioneer mutual fund will continue to be subject to the CDSC of the 
shares originally held until the original 12-month period expires. However, no  
CDSC is payable with respect to purchases by 401(a) or 401(k) retirement plans  
with 1,000 or more eligible participants or with at least $10 million in plan   
assets.                                                                         

General. Redemptions may be suspended or payment postponed during any period in 
which any of the following conditions exist: the Exchange is closed or trading  
on the Exchange is restricted; an emergency exists as a result of which disposal
by the Fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable for the Fund to fairly determine the value of the net    
assets of its portfolio; or the SEC, by order, so permits.                      

Redemptions and repurchases are taxable transactions to shareholders. The net   
asset value per share received upon redemption or repurchase may be more or less
than the cost of shares to an investor, depending on the market value of the    
portfolio at the time of redemption or repurchase.                              

IX. HOW TO EXCHANGE FUND SHARES                                                 
Written Exchanges. You may exchange your shares by sending a letter of          
instruction to PSC. Your letter should include your name, the name of the Fund  
out of which you wish to exchange and the name of the Fund into which you wish  
to exchange, your fund account number(s), the Class of shares to be exchanged   
and the dollar amount or number of shares to be exchanged. Written exchange     
requests must be signed by all record owner(s) exactly as the shares are        
registered.                                                                     

Telephone Exchanges. Your account is automatically authorized to have the       
telephone exchange privilege unless you indicate otherwise on your Account      
Application or by writing to PSC. Proper account identification will be         
required for each telephone exchange. Telephone exchanges may not exceed        
$500,000 per account per day. All telephone exchange requests will be           
recorded. See "Telephone Transactions and Related Liabilities" below.           

Automatic Exchanges. You may automatically exchange shares from one Pioneer     
account for shares of the same Class in another Pioneer account on a monthly or 
quarterly basis. The accounts must have identical registrations and the         
originating account must have a minimum balance of $5,000. The exchange will be 
effective on the 18th day of the month.                                         

General. Exchanges must be at least $1,000. You may exchange your investment    
from one Class of Fund shares at net asset value, without a sales charge, for   
shares of the same Class of any other Pioneer fund. Not all Pioneer funds offer 
more than one Class of shares. A new Pioneer account opened through an exchange 
must have a registration identical to that on the original account.             

Class A or Class B shares which would normally be subject to a CDSC upon        
redemption will not be charged the applicable CDSC at the time of an exchange.  
Shares acquired in an exchange will be subject to the CDSC of the shares        
originally held. For purposes of determining the amount of any applicable CDSC, 
the length of time you have owned Class B shares acquired by exchange will be   
measured from the date you acquired the original shares and will not be affected
by any subsequent exchange.                                                     

Exchange requests received by PSC before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, will be        
effective on that day if the requirements above have been met, otherwise, they  
will be effective on the next business day. PSC will process exchanges only     
after receiving an exchange request in good order. There are currently no fees  
or sales charges imposed at the time of an exchange. An                         

P-->485BPOS15th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
exchange of shares may be made only in states where legally permitted. For      
federal and (generally) state income tax purposes, an exchange is considered to 
be a sale of the shares of the fund exchanged and a purchase of shares in       
another fund. Therefore, an exchange could result in a gain or loss on the      
shares sold, depending on the tax basis of these shares and the timing of the   
transaction, and special tax rules may apply.                                   

You should consider the differences in objectives and policies of the Pioneer   
mutual funds, as described in each fund's current prospectus, before making any 
exchange. To prevent abuse of the exchange privilege to the detriment of other  
Fund shareholders, the Fund and PFD reserve the right to limit the number and/or
frequency of exchanges and/or to charge a fee for exchanges. The exchange       
privilege may be changed or discontinued and may be subject to additional       
limitations, including certain restrictions on purchases by market timer        
accounts.                                                                       

X. DISTRIBUTION PLANS                                                           
The Fund has adopted a Plan of Distribution for both Class A shares ("Class A
Plan") and Class B shares ("Class B Plan") in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under  
the 1940 Act pursuant to which certain distribution and service fees are paid.  

Pursuant to the Class A Plan, the Fund reimburses PFD for its actual            
expenditures to finance any activity primarily intended to result in the sale of
Class A shares or to provide services to holders of Class A shares, provided the
categories of expenses for which reimbursement is made are approved by the      
Fund's Board of Trustees. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Board of       
Trustees has approved the following categories of expenses for Class A shares of
the Fund: (i) a service fee to be paid to qualified broker-dealers in an amount 
not to exceed 0.25% per annum of the Fund's daily net assets attributable to    
Class A shares; (ii) reimbursement to PFD for its expenditures for broker-dealer
commissions and employee compensation on certain sales of the Fund's Class A    
shares with no initial sales charge (See "How to Buy Fund Shares"); and (iii)   
reimbursement to PFD for expenses incurred in providing services to Class A     
shareholders and supporting broker-dealers and other organizations (such as     
banks and trust companies) in their efforts to provide such services. Banks are 
currently prohibited under the Glass-Steagall Act from providing certain        
underwriting or distribution services. If a bank was prohibited from acting in  
any capacity or providing any of the described services, management would       
consider what action, if any, would be appropriate.                             

Expenditures of the Fund pursuant to the Class A Plan are accrued daily and may 
not exceed 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class A 
shares. Distribution expenses of PFD are expected to substantially exceed the   
distribution fees paid by the Fund in a given year. The Class A Plan may not be 
amended to increase materially the annual percentage limitation of average net  
assets which may be spent for the services described therein without approval of
the shareholders of the Fund. The Class A Plan does not provide for the         
carryover of reimbursable expenses beyond twelve months from the time the Fund  
is first invoiced for an expense. The limited carryover provision in the Class A
Plan may result in an expense invoiced to the Fund in one fiscal year being paid
in the subsequent fiscal year and thus being treated for purposes of calculating
the maximum expenditures of the Fund as having been incurred in the subsequent  
fiscal year. In the event of termination or non-continuance of the Class A      
Plan, the Fund has twelve months to reimburse any expense which it incurs prior 
to such termination or non-continuance, provided that payments by the Fund      
during such twelve-month period shall not exceed 0.25% of the Fund's average    
daily net assets attributable to the Class A shares during such period.         

The Class B Plan provides that the Fund will pay a distribution fee at the      
annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to     
Class B shares and will pay PFD a service fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of the
Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class B shares. The distribution
fee is intended to compensate PFD for its distribution services to the Fund. The
service fee is intended to be additional compensation for personal services     
and/or account maintenance services with respect to Class B shares. PFD also    
receives the proceeds of any CDSC imposed on the redemption of Class B shares.  

Commissions of 4%, equal to 3.75% of the amount invested and a first year's     
service fee equal to 0.25% of the amount invested in Class B shares, are paid to
broker-dealers who have selling agreements with PFD. PFD may advance to dealers 
the first year service fee at a rate up to 0.25% of the purchase price of such  
shares and, as compensation therefor, PFD may retain the service fee paid by the
Fund with respect to such shares for the first year after purchase. Dealers will
become eligible for additional service fees with respect to such shares         
commencing in the 13th month following the purchase. Dealers may from time to   
time be required to meet certain criteria in order to receive service fees. PFD 
or its affiliates are entitled to retain all service fees payable under the     
Class B Plan for which there is no dealer of record or for which qualification  
standards have not been met as partial consideration for personal services      
and/or account maintenance services performed by PFD or its affiliates for      
shareholder accounts.                                                           

XI. DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXATION                                       
The Fund has elected to be treated, has qualified, and intends to qualify each  
year as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code, so that
it will not pay federal income taxes on income and capital gains distributed to 
shareholders at least annually.                                                 

Under the Code, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on a  
portion of its undistributed income and capital gains if it fails to meet       
certain distribution requirements by the end of the calendar year. The Fund     
intends to make distributions in a timely manner and accordingly does not expect
to be subject to the excise tax.                                                

The Fund pays dividends from net investment income and distributes its net      
realized short and long-term capital gains, if any, annually, usually in the    
month of December, with additional distributions made only as required to avoid 
federal income or excise tax. Unless shareholders specify otherwise, all        
distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional full and fractional
shares of the Fund. Dividends from the Fund's net investment income, certain net
foreign                                                                         

P-->485BPOS16th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
exchange gains and net short-term capital gains are taxable as ordinary income, 
and dividends from the Fund's net long-term capital gains are taxable as        
long-term capital gains. For federal income tax purposes, all dividends are     
taxable as described above whether a shareholder takes them in cash or reinvests
them in additional shares of the Fund. Information as to the federal tax status 
of dividends and distributions will be provided annually. For further           
information on the distribution options available to shareholders, see          
"Distribution Options" and "Directed Dividends" below.                          

In any year in which the Fund qualifies, it may make an election that will      
permit certain of its shareholders to take a credit (or, if more advantageous, a
deduction) for foreign income taxes paid by the Fund. Each shareholder would    
then treat as an additional dividend his or her appropriate share of the amount 
of foreign taxes paid by the Fund. If this election is made, the Fund will      
notify its shareholders annually as to their share of the amount of foreign     
taxes paid and the foreign source income of the Fund.                           

Dividends and other distributions and the proceeds of redemptions or repurchases
of Fund shares paid to individuals and other non-exempt payees will be subject  
to a 31% backup withholding of federal income tax if the Fund is not provided   
with the shareholder's correct taxpayer identification number and certification 
that the number is correct and the shareholder is not subject to backup         
withholding or the Fund receives notice from the IRS or a broker that such      
withholding applies. Please refer to the Account Application for additional     
information.                                                                    

The description above relates only to U.S. federal income tax consequences      
for shareholders who are U.S. persons, i.e., U.S. citizens or residents or      
U.S. corporations, partnerships, trust or estates, and who are subject to       
U.S. federal income tax. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors     
regarding state, local and other applicable tax laws.                           

XII. SHAREHOLDER SERVICES                                                       
PSC is the shareholder services and transfer agent for shares of the Fund. PSC, 
a Massachusetts corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGI. PSC's offices 
are located at 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, and inquiries to   
PSC should be mailed to Pioneering Services Corporation, P.O. Box 9014, Boston, 
Massachusetts 02205-9014. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (the "Custodian") serves
as custodian of the Fund's portfolio securities. The principal business address 
of the mutual fund division of the Custodian is 40 Water Street, Boston,        
Massachusetts 02109. The Custodian oversees a network of subcustodians and      
depositories in the countries in which the Fund may invest.                     

Account and Confirmation Statements                                             
PSC maintains an account for each shareholder and all transactions of the       
shareholder are recorded in this account. Confirmation statements showing       
details of transactions are sent to shareholders as transactions occur except   
automatic investment plan transactions which are confirmed quarterly. The       
Pioneer Combined Account Statement, mailed quarterly, is available to           
shareholders who have more than one Pioneer account.                            

Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of an investment broker-dealer or
other party will not normally have an account with the Fund and might not be    
able to utilize some of the services available to shareholders of record.       
Examples of services which might not be available are investment or redemption  
of shares by mail or telephone, automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital 
gains distributions, withdrawal plans, Letters of Intention, Rights of          
Accumulation, telephone exchanges, and newsletters.                             

Additional Investments                                                          
You may add to your account by sending a check (minimum of $50 for Class A      
shares and $500 for Class B shares) to PSC (account number and Class of shares  
should be clearly indicated). The bottom portion of a confirmation statement may
be used as a remittance slip to make additional investments. Additions to your  
account, whether by check or through an Investomatic Plan, are invested in full 
and fractional shares of the Fund at the applicable offering price in effect as 
of the close of regular trading on the Exchange on the day of receipt.          

Automatic Investment Plans                                                      
You may arrange for regular automatic investments of $50 or more through        
government/military allotments, payroll deduction or through a Pioneer          
Investomatic Plan. A Pioneer Investomatic Plan provides for a monthly or        
quarterly investment by means of a pre-authorized draft drawn on a checking     
account. Pioneer Investomatic Plan investments are voluntary, and you may       
discontinue the plan at any time without penalty upon 30 days' written notice.  
PSC acts as agent for the purchaser, the broker-dealer and PFD in maintaining   
these plans.                                                                    

Financial Reports and Tax Information                                           
As a shareholder, you will receive financial reports at least semiannually. In  
January of each year, the Fund will mail you information about the tax status of
dividends and distributions.                                                    

Distribution Options                                                            
Dividends and capital gains distributions, if any, will automatically be        
invested in additional shares of the Fund, at the applicable net asset value per
share, unless you indicate another option on the Account Application.           

Two other options available are (a) dividends in cash and capital gains         
distributions in additional shares; and (b) all dividends and capital gains     
distributions in cash. These two options are not available, however, for        
retirement plans or for an account with a net asset value of less than $500.    
Changes in your distribution options may be made by written request to PSC.     

Directed Dividends                                                              
You may elect (in writing) to have the dividends paid by one Pioneer mutal fund 
account invested in a second Pioneer fund account. The value of this second     
account must be at least $1,000 ($500 for Pioneer Fund or Pioneer II). Invested 
dividends may be in any amount, and there are no fees or charges for this       
service. Retirement plan shareholders may only direct dividends to accounts with
identical registrations, i.e., PGA IRA Cust for John Smith may only go into     
another account registered PGA IRA Cust for John Smith.                         

Direct Deposit                                                                  
If you have elected to take distributions, whether dividends or dividends and   
capital gains, in cash, or have established a Systematic Withdrawal Plan, you   
may choose to have those                                                        

P-->485BPOS17th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
cash payments deposited directly into your savings, checking or NOW bank        
account. You may also establish this service by completing the appropriate      
section on the Account Application when opening a new account or the Account    
Options Form for an existing account.                                           

Voluntary Tax Withholding                                                       
You may request (in writing) that PSC withhold 28% of the dividends and capital 
gains distributions paid from your account (before any reinvestment) and forward
the amount withheld to the IRS as a credit against your federal income taxes.   
This option is not available for retirement plan accounts or for accounts       
subject to backup withholding.                                                  

Telephone Transactions and Related Liabilities                                  
Your account is automatically authorized to have telephone transaction          
privileges unless you indicated otherwise on your Account Application or by     
writing to PSC. You may sell or exchange your Fund shares by telephone by       
calling 1-800-225-6292 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on          
weekdays. See "Share Price" for more information. To confirm that each          
transaction instruction received by telephone is genuine, the Fund will record  
each telephone transaction, require the caller to provide the personal          
identification number (PIN) for the account and send you a written confirmation 
of each telephone transaction. Different procedures may apply to accounts that  
are registered to non-U.S. citizens or that are held in the name of an          
institution or in the name of an investment broker-dealer or other third-party. 
If reasonable procedures, such as those described above, are not followed, the  
Fund may be liable for any loss due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions. 
The Fund may implement other procedures from time to time. In all other cases,  
neither the Fund, PSC nor PFD will be responsible for the authenticity of       
instructions received by telephone, therefore, you bear the risk of loss for    
unauthorized or fraudulent telephone transactions.                              

During times of economic turmoil or market volatility or as a result of severe  
weather or a natural disaster, it may be difficult to contact the Fund by       
telephone to institute a redemption or exchange. You should communicate with the
Fund in writing if you are unable to reach the Fund by telephone.               

Retirement Plans                                                                
You should contact the Retirement Plans Department of PSC at 1-800-622-0176 for 
information relating to retirement plans for businesses, age-weighted profit    
sharing plans, Simplified Employee Pension Plans, Individual Retirement Accounts
(IRAs), and Section 403(b) retirement plans for employees of certain non-profit 
organizations and public school systems, all of which are available in          
conjunction with investments in the Fund. The Account Application contained in  
this Prospectus should not be used to establish any of these plans. Separate    
applications are required.                                                      

Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD)                                    
If you have a hearing disability and you own TDD keyboard equipment, you can    
call our TDD number toll-free at 1-800-225-1997, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. Eastern Time to contact our telephone representatives with questions about 
your account.                                                                   

Systematic Withdrawal Plans                                                     
If your account has a total value of at least $10,000 you may establish a       
Systematic Withdrawal Plan ("SWP") providing for fixed payments at regular      
intervals. Withdrawals from Class B share accounts are limited to 10% of the    
value of the account at the time the plan is implemented. See "Waiver or
Reduction of Contingent Deferred Sales Charge" for more information. Periodic   
payments of $50 or more will be sent to you, or any person designated by you,   
monthly or quarterly and your periodic redemptions may be taxable to you.       
Payments can be made either by check or electronic transfer to a bank account   
designated by you. If you direct that withdrawal payments be made to another    
person after you have opened your account, a signature guarantee must accompany 
your instructions. Purchases of Class A shares of the Fund at a time when you   
have a SWP in effect may result in the payment of unnecessary sales charges and 
may, therefore, be disadvantageous.                                             

You may obtain additional information by calling PSC at 1-800-225-6292 or by    
referring to the Statement of Additional Information.                           

Reinstatement Privilege (Class A Shares Only)                                   
If you redeem all or part of your Class A shares of the Fund, you may reinvest  
all or part of the redemption proceeds without a sales charge in Class A shares 
of the Fund if you send a written request to PSC not more than 90 days after    
your shares were redeemed. Your redemption proceeds will be reinvested at the   
next determined net asset value of the Class A shares of the Fund in effect     
immediately after receipt of the written request for reinstatement. You may     
realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the       
redemption and special tax rules may apply if a reinstatement occurs. In        
addition, if redemption resulted in a loss and an investment is made in shares  
of the Fund within 30 days before or after the redemption, you may not be able  
to recognize the loss for federal income tax purposes. Subject to the provisions
outlined under "How to Exchange Fund Shares" above, you may also reinvest in    
Class A shares of other Pioneer mutual funds; in this case, you must meet the   
minimum investment requirement for each fund you enter.                         

The 90-day reinstatement period may be extended by PFD for periods of up to one 
year for shareholders living in areas that have experienced a natural disaster, 
such as a flood, hurricane, tornado or earthquake.                              

The options and services available to shareholders, including the terms of the  
Exchange Privilege and the Pioneer Investomatic Plan, may be revised, suspended 
or terminated at any time by PFD or by the Fund. You may establish the services 
described in this section when you open your account. You may also establish or 
revise many of them on an existing account by completing an Account Options     
Form, which you may request by calling 1-800-225-6292.                          

XIII. THE FUND                                                                  
Pioneer International Growth Fund is an open-end, diversified management        
investment company (commonly referred to as a mutual fund) organized as a       
Massachusetts business trust on October 26, 1992. The Fund has authorized an    
unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest. As an open-end management    
investment company, the Fund usually continuously offers                        

P-->485BPOS18th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
its shares to the public and under normal conditions must redeem its shares upon
the demand of any shareholder at the then current net asset value per share,    
less any applicable CDSC. See "How to Sell Fund Shares." The Fund is not        
required, and does not intend, to hold annual shareholder meetings, although    
special meetings may be called for the purposes of electing or removing         
Trustees, changing fundamental investment restrictions or approving a management
or subadvisory contract.                                                        

The Trustees have the authority, without further shareholder approval, to       
classify and reclassify the shares of the Fund, or any additional series of the 
Fund, into one or more classes. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Trustees 
have authorized the issuance of two classes of shares, designated Class A and   
Class B. The shares of each class represent an interest in the same portfolio of
investments of the Fund. Each class has equal rights as to voting, redemption,  
dividends and liquidation, except that each class bears different distribution  
and transfer agent fees and may bear other expenses properly attributable to the
particular class. Class A and Class B shareholders have exclusive voting rights 
with respect to the Rule 12b-1 distribution plans adopted by holders of those   
shares in connection with the distribution of shares. The Fund reserves the     
right to create and issue additional series and classes of shares.              

When issued and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Prospectus and     
Statement of Additional Information, shares of the Fund are fully-paid and      
non-assessable by the Fund. Shares will remain on deposit with the Fund's       
transfer agent and certificates will not normally be issued. The Fund reserves  
the right to charge a fee for the issuance of certificates.                     

XIV. INVESTMENT RESULTS                                                         
The average annual total return (for a designated period of time) on an         
investment in the Fund may be included in advertisements, and furnished to      
existing or prospective shareholders. The average annual total return for each  
Class is computed in accordance with the SEC's standardized formula. The        
calculation for all Classes assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and       
distributions at net asset value and does not reflect the impact of federal or  
state income taxes. In addition, for Class A shares the calculation assumes the 
deduction of the maximum sales charge of 5.75%; for Class B shares the          
calculation reflects the deduction of any applicable CDSC. The periods          
illustrated would normally include one, five and ten years (or since the        
commencement of the public offering of the shares of a Class, if shorter)       
through the most recent calendar quarter.                                       

One or more additional measures and assumptions, including but not limited to   
historical total returns; distribution returns; results of actual or            
hypothetical investments; changes in dividends, distributions or share values;  
or any graphic illustration of such data may also be used. These data may cover 
any period of the Fund's existence and may or may not include the impact of     
sales charges, taxes or other factors.                                          

Other investments or savings vehicles and/or to unmanaged market indexes,       
indicators of economic activity or averages of mutual funds results may be cited
or compared with the investment results of the Fund. Rankings or listings by    
magazines, newspapers or independent statistical or rating services, such as    
Lipper Analytical Services, Inc., may also be referenced.                       

The Fund's investment results will vary from time to time depending on market   
conditions, the composition of the Fund's portfolio and operating expenses of   
the Fund. All quoted investment results are historical and should not be        
considered representative of what an investment in the Fund may earn in any     
future period. For further information about the calculation methods and uses of
the Fund's investment results, see the Statement of Additional Information.

APPENDIX                                                                        
RISKS AND LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTIONS IN OPTIONS, FUTURES CONTRACTS
AND FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 

The Fund may employ certain active management techniques including options      
on securities indices, options on currencies, futures contracts and options on  
futures and forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Each of these active   
management techniques involves (1) liquidity risk that contractual positions    
cannot be easily closed out in the event of market changes or generally in the  
absence of a liquid secondary market, (2) correlation risk that changes in the  
value of hedging positions may not match the securities market and foreign      
currency fluctuations intended to be hedged, and (3) market risk that an        
incorrect prediction of securities prices or exchange rates by the Manager may  
cause the Fund to perform less well than if such positions had not been entered.
The ability to terminate over-the-counter options is more limited than with     
exchange traded options and may involve the risk that the counter-party to the  
option will not fulfill its obligations. The Fund will treat purchased over-the-
counter options as illiquid securities. The uses of options, futures and forward
foreign currency exchange contracts are highly specialized activities which     
involve investment techniques and risks that are different from those associated
with ordinary portfolio transactions. The loss that may be incurred by the Fund 
in entering into futures contracts and written options thereon and forward      
foreign currency exchange contracts is potentially unlimited. Except as set     
forth below under "Futures Contracts and Options on Futures Contracts" there is 
no limit on the percentage of the Fund's assets that may be invested in futures 
contracts and related options or forward foreign currency exchange contracts.   
The Fund may not invest more than 5% of its total assets in purchased options   
other than protective put options.                                              

The Fund's transactions in options, forward foreign currency exchange contracts,
futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be limited by the        
requirements for qualification of the Fund as a regulated investment company for
tax purposes. See "Tax Status" in the Statement of Additional Information.      

Options on Securities Indices                                                   
The Fund may purchase put and call options on indices that are based on         
securities in which it may invest to manage cash flow and to manage its exposure
to foreign and domestic stocks or stock markets instead of, or in addition to,  
buying and selling stock. The Fund may also purchase options in order to hedge  
against risks of market-wide price fluctuations.                                

The Fund may purchase put options in an attempt to hedge against an anticipated 
decline in securities prices that might adversely affect the value of the Fund's
portfolio securities. If the Fund purchases a put option on a securities index, 
the amount of the payment it would receive upon exercising the option would     
depend on the extent of any decline in the level of the securities index below  
the exercise price. Such payments would tend to offset a decline in the value of
the Fund's portfolio securities. However, if the level of the securities index  
increases and remains above the exercise price while the put option is          
outstanding, the Fund will not be able to exercise the option profitably and    
will lose the amount of the premium and any transaction costs. Such loss may be 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities.

The Fund may purchase call options on securities indices in order to remain     
fully invested in a particular foreign stock market or to lock in a favorable   
price on securities that it intends to buy in the future. If the Fund purchases 
a call option on a securities index, the amount of the payment it receives upon 
exercising the option depends on the extent of an increase in the level of other
securities indices above the exercise price. Such payments would in effect allow
the Fund to benefit from securities market appreciation even though it may not  
have had sufficient cash to purchase the underlying securities. Such payments   
may also offset increases in the price of securities that the Fund intends to   
purchase. If, however, the level of the securities index declines and remains   
below the exercise price while the call option is outstanding, the Fund will not
be able to exercise the option profitably and will lose the amount of the       
premium and transaction costs. Such loss may be partially offset by a reduction 
in the price the Fund pays to buy additional securities for its portfolio.      

The Fund may sell an option it has purchased or a similar option prior to the   
expiration of the purchased option in order to close out its position in an     
option which it has purchased. The Fund may also allow options to expire        
unexercised, which would result in the loss of the premium paid.                

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Options on Foreign Currencies   

The Fund has the ability to hold a portion of its assets in foreign currencies  
and to enter into forward foreign currency contracts to facilitate settlement of
foreign securities transactions or to protect against changes in foreign        
currency exchange rates. The Fund might sell a foreign currency on either a spot
or forward basis to seek to hedge against an anticipated decline in the dollar  
value of securities in its portfolio or securities it intends or has contracted 
to sell or to preserve the U.S. dollar value of dividends, interest or other    
amounts it expects to receive. Although this strategy could minimize the risk of
loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged foreign currency, it could also
limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in the value of the
currency. Alternatively, the Fund might purchase a foreign currency or enter    
into a forward purchase contract for the currency to preserve the U.S. dollar   
price of securities it is authorized to purchase or has contracted to purchase. 

The Fund may also engage in cross-hedging by using forward contracts in one     
currency to hedge against fluctuations in the value of securities denominated in
a different currency, if the Manager determines that there is a pattern of      
correlation between the two currencies. Cross-hedging may also include entering 
into a forward transaction involving two foreign currencies, using one foreign  
currency as a proxy for the                                                     

P-->485BPOS20th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
U.S. dollar to hedge against variations in the other foreign currency, if the   
Manager determines that there is a pattern of correlation between the proxy     
currency and the U.S. dollar.                                                   

If the Fund enters into a forward contract to buy foreign currency for any      
purpose, the Fund will be required to place cash or liquid, high grade          
securities in a segregated account of the Fund maintained by the Fund's         
custodian in an amount equal to the value of the Fund's total assets committed  
to the consummation of the forward contract.                                    

The Fund may purchase put and call options on foreign cur rencies for the       
purpose of protecting against declines in the dollar value of foreign portfolio 
securities and against increases in the U.S. dollar cost of foreign securities  
to be acquired. The Fund may also use options on currency to cross-hedge. The   
purchase of an option on a foreign currency may constitute an effective hedge   
against exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the Fund may purchase call or  
put options on currency for non-hedging purposes when the Manager anticipates   
that the currency will appreciate or depreciate but the securities denominated  
in that currency do not present attractive investment opportunities and are not 
held in the Fund's portfolio.                                                   

Futures Contracts and Options on Futures Contracts                              

To hedge against changes in securities prices, currency exchange rates, or      
interest rates, the Fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures         
contracts, and purchase and write call and put options on any of such futures   
contracts. The Fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale transactions  
with respect to any of such contracts and options. The futures contracts may be 
based on various stock and other securities indices, foreign currencies and     
other financial instruments and indices. The Fund will engage in futures and    
related options transactions for bona fide hedging or other non-hedging purposes
as are permitted by regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    

The Fund may not purchase or sell non-hedging futures contracts or purchase or  
sell related non-hedging options, except for closing purchase or sale           
transactions, if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of initial margin 
deposits on the Fund's existing non-hedging futures and related non-hedging     
options positions and the amount of premiums paid for existing non-hedging      
options on futures (net of the amount the positions are "in the money") would   
exceed 5% of the market value of the Fund's net assets. These transactions      
involve brokerage costs, require margin deposits and, in the case of contracts  
and options obligating the Fund to purchase currencies, require the Fund to     
segregate assets to cover such contracts and options.                           

Repurchase Agreements                                                           

The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements not exceeding seven days in       
duration. In a repurchase agreement, an investor (e.g., the Fund) purchases a   
debt security from a seller which undertakes to repurchase the security at a    
specified resale price on an agreed future date (ordinarily a week or less). The
resale price generally exceeds the purchase price by an amount which reflects an
agreed-upon market interest rate for the term of the repurchase agreement.      
Repurchase agreements entered into by the Fund will be fully collateralized with
U.S. Treasury and/or U.S. government agency obligations with a market value of  
not less than 100% of the obligation, valued daily. Collateral will be held in a
segregated, safekeeping account for the benefit of the Fund. In the event that a
repurchase agreement is not fulfilled, the Fund could suffer a loss to the      
extent that the value of the collateral falls below the repurchase price or if  
the Fund is prevented from realizing the value of the collateral by reason of an
order of a court with jurisdiction over an insolvency proceeding with respect to
the other party to the repurchase agreement.                                    

Restricted and Illiquid Securities                                              

The Fund may invest in restricted securities (i.e., securities that would be    
required to be registered prior to distribution to the public), including       
restricted securities eligible for resale to certain institutional investors    
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, the Fund   
may invest up to 15% of its net assets in restricted securities sold and offered
under Rule 144A that are illiquid either as a result of legal or contractual    
restrictions or the absence of a trading market.                                

The Board of Trustees of the Fund has adopted guidelines and delegated to the   
Manager the daily function of determining and monitoring the liquidity of       
restricted securities. The Board, however, retains sufficient oversight and is  
ultimately responsible for the determinations. Since it is not possible to      
predict with assurance exactly how the market for restricted securities sold and
offered under Rule 144A will develop, the Board carefully monitors the Fund's   
investments in these securities, focusing on such important factors, among      
others, as valuation, liquidity and availability of information. This investment
practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in the    
Fund to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time        
uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities. Securities of non-U.S.  
issuers that the Fund acquires in Rule 144A transactions, but which the Fund may
resell publicly in a non-U.S. securities market, are not considered restricted  
securities.

1.       INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS 

         The Prospectus (the "Prospectus") of Pioneer  International Growth Fund
(the "Fund"),  identifies the investment  objective and the principal investment
policies of the Fund. Other investment policies of the Fund are set forth below.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning given to them in
the Prospectus.                                                                 

Securities Index Options                                                        

         The Fund may purchase  call and put options on  securities  indices for
the purpose of hedging against the risk of unfavorable price movements adversely
affecting the value of the Fund's  securities or securities  the Fund intends to
buy. Securities index options will not be used for speculative purposes.        

         Currently,  options  on  stock  indices  are  traded  only on  national
securities  exchanges  and  over-the-counter,  both in the United  States and in
foreign  countries.  A securities  index  fluctuates  with changes in the market
values of the securities  included in the index.  For example,  some stock index
options are based on a broad  market index such as the S&P 500 or the Value Line
Composite  Index in the U.S.,  the Nikkei in Japan or the FTSE 100 in the United
Kingdom.  Index options may also be based on a narrower market index such as the
S&P 100 or on an industry or market  segment  such as the AMEX Oil and Gas Index
or the Computer and Business Equipment Index.                                   

         The Fund may  purchase  put  options  in  order  to  hedge  against  an
anticipated  decline in securities  prices that might adversely affect the value
of the Fund's  portfolio  securities.  If the Fund  purchases  a put option on a
securities index, the amount of the payment it would receive upon exercising the
option would depend on the extent of any decline in the level of the  securities
index below the exercise price.  Such payments would tend to offset a decline in
the  value of the  Fund's  portfolio  securities.  However,  if the level of the
securities  index  increases and remains above the exercise  price while the put
option is  outstanding,  the Fund will not be able to  profitably  exercise  the
option and will lose the amount of the premium and any transaction  costs.  Such
loss may be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Fund's portfolio
securities.                                                                     

         The Fund may purchase  call options on  securities  indices in order to
remain  fully  invested in a  particular  foreign  stock  market or to lock in a
favorable price on securities that it intends to buy in the future.  If the Fund
purchases  a call  option on a  securities  index,  the amount of the payment it
receives upon  exercising the option depends on the extent of an increase in the
level of other securities  indices above the exercise price. Such payments would
in effect allow the Fund to benefit from  securities  market  appreciation  even
though  it  may  not  have  had  sufficient  cash  to  purchase  the  underlying
securities.  Such payments may also offset  increases in the price of securities
that the Fund  intends to purchase.  If,  however,  the level of the  securities
index  declines and remains  below the  exercise  price while the call option is
outstanding,  the Fund will not be able to exercise  the option  profitably  and
will lose the amount of the  premium  and  transaction  costs.  Such loss may be
partially  offset by a  reduction  in the price the Fund pays to buy  additional
securities for its portfolio.                                                   

         The Fund may sell the securities index option it has purchased or write
a similar offsetting securities index option in order to close out a position in
a  securities   index  option  which  it  has  purchased.   These  closing  sale
transactions  enable the Fund to immediately realize gains or minimize losses on
its options  positions.  However,  there is no assurance that a liquid secondary
market on an options  exchange will exist for any particular  option,  or at any
particular  time,  and for some  options  no  secondary  market  may  exist.  In
addition,  securities  index  prices may be distorted  by  interruptions  in the
trading of securities of certain companies or of issuers in certain  industries,
or by  restrictions  that may be  imposed by an  exchange  on opening or closing
transactions,  or both,  which would disrupt  trading in options on such indices
and  preclude the Fund from  closing out its options  positions.  If the Fund is
unable to effect a closing sale  transaction with respect to options that it has
purchased, it would have to exercise the options in order to realize any profit.

         The hours of trading for  options  may not conform to the hours  during
which the  underlying  securities  are  traded.  To the extent  that the options
markets  close  before the markets for the  underlying  securities,  significant
price and rate movements can take place in the  underlying  markets that can not
be  reflected  in the  options  markets.  The  purchase  of  options is a highly
B-2 

P-->485BPOS26th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
specialized  activity which involves  investment  techniques and risks different
from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Personnel
of the Fund's investment adviser,  Pioneering  Management  Corporation  ("PMC"),
have considerable experience in options transactions.                           

         In addition to the risks of  imperfect  correlation  between the Fund's
portfolio and the index underlying the option,  the purchase of securities index
options  involves  the risk that the premium and  transaction  costs paid by the
Fund in  purchasing  an option  will be lost.  This  could  occur as a result of
unanticipated  movements in prices of the  securities  comprising the securities
index on which the option is based.                                             

Forward Foreign Currency Transactions                                           

         The foreign  currency  transactions  of the Fund may be  conducted on a
spot,  i.e.  cash  basis at the spot rate for  purchasing  or  selling  currency
prevailing in the foreign exchange  market.  The Fund also has authority to deal
in forward  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  involving  currencies of the
different  countries  in  which  it  will  invest  as a hedge  against  possible
variations in the foreign  exchange rate between these  currencies  and the U.S.
dollar. This is accomplished through contractual  agreements to purchase or sell
a specified currency at a specified future date and price set at the time of the
contract.  The Fund's  dealings in forward  foreign  currency  contracts will be
limited  to  hedging  either  specific   transactions  or  portfolio  positions.
Transaction  hedging  is the  purchase  or  sale  of  forward  foreign  currency
contracts with respect to specific  receivables or payables of the Fund accruing
in connection with the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities denominated
in foreign currencies.  Portfolio hedging is the use of forward foreign currency
contracts to offset portfolio security  positions  denominated or quoted in such
foreign  currencies.  There is no  guarantee  that the Fund will be  engaged  in
hedging  activities when adverse exchange rate movements occur. The Fund may not
necessarily  attempt to hedge all of its foreign  portfolio  positions  and will
enter into such transactions  only to the extent, if any, deemed  appropriate by
PMC.  The  Fund  will  not  enter  into  speculative  forward  foreign  currency
contracts.                                                                      

         If the  Fund  enters  into  a  forward  contract  to  purchase  foreign
currency,  its  custodian  bank will  segregate  cash or high grade  liquid debt
securities in a separate  account of the Fund in an amount equal to the value of
the Fund's total assets committed to the consummation of such forward  contract.
Those  assets  will be valued at market  daily and if the value of the assets in
the separate account  declines,  additional cash or securities will be placed in
the  accounts  so that the value of the  account  will  equal the  amount of the
Fund's commitment with respect to such contracts.                               

         Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations  in the prices of  portfolio  securities  or prevent  losses if the
prices of such securities decline.  Such transactions also limit the opportunity
for gain if the value of the hedged currency should rise.  Moreover,  it may not
be possible  for the Fund to hedge  against a  devaluation  that is so generally
anticipated  that the Fund is not able to  contract  to sell the  currency  at a
price above the devaluation level it anticipates.                               

         The cost to the  Fund of  engaging  in  foreign  currency  transactions
varies with such factors as the currency involved, the size of the contract, the
length of the contract period and the market  conditions then prevailing.  Since
transactions in foreign currency and forward  contracts are usually conducted on
a principal basis, no fees or commissions are involved. The Fund may close out a
forward  position in a currency by selling the forward contract or entering into
an offsetting forward contract.                                                 

Options on Foreign Currencies                                                   

         The Fund  may  purchase  options  on  foreign  currencies  for  hedging
purposes in a manner similar to that of transactions in forward  contracts.  For
example,  a decline in the dollar value of a foreign currency in which portfolio
securities are denominated will reduce the dollar value of such securities, even
if their value in the foreign  currency  remains  constant.  In order to protect
against  such  decreases  in the  value of  portfolio  securities,  the Fund may
purchase  put  options on the  foreign  currency.  If the value of the  currency
declines,  the Fund will have the right to sell such currency for a fixed amount
of dollars which exceeds the market value of such currency. This would result in
a gain that may offset,  in whole or in part,  the  negative  effect of currency
depreciation on the value of the Fund's securities denominated in that currency.

         Conversely,  if a rise in the dollar  value of a currency is  projected
for  those  securities  to be  acquired,  thereby  increasing  the  cost of such
securities, the Fund may purchase call options on such currency. If the value of
B-3 

P-->485BPOS27th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
such currency increased, the purchase of such call options would enable the Fund
to purchase currency for a fixed amount of dollars which is less than the market
value of such currency.  Such a purchase would result in a gain that may offset,
at least partially,  the effect of any currency related increase in the price of
securities the Fund intends to acquire. As in the case of other types of options
transactions,  however,  the benefit the Fund  derives from  purchasing  foreign
currency  options  will be  reduced  by the amount of the  premium  and  related
transaction  costs. In addition,  if currency  exchange rates do not move in the
direction  or to the  extent  anticipated,  the Fund  could  sustain  losses  on
transactions in foreign  currency options which would deprive it of a portion or
all of the benefits of advantageous changes in such rates.                      

         The Fund may  close out its  position  in a  currency  option by either
selling the option it has purchased or entering into an offsetting option.      

Futures Contracts and Options on Futures Contracts                              

         To hedge  against  changes in  securities  prices or currency  exchange
rates,  the Fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures  contracts,  and
purchase and write (sell) call and put options on any of such futures contracts.
The Fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale transactions with respect
to any of such  contracts  and options.  The futures  contracts  may be based on
various securities (such as U.S.  Government  securities),  securities  indices,
foreign  currencies and other financial  instruments and indices.  The Fund will
engage in futures and related  options  transactions  for bona fide  hedging and
non-hedging  purposes as described below. All futures  contracts entered into by
the Fund are traded on U.S.  exchanges  or boards of trade that are licensed and
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") or on foreign
exchanges.                                                                      

         Futures Contracts.  A futures contract may generally be described as an
agreement between two parties to buy and sell particular  financial  instruments
for an agreed  price  during a  designated  month (or to deliver  the final cash
settlement  price,  in the case of a contract  relating to an index or otherwise
not calling for physical delivery at the end of trading in the contract).       

         When interest  rates are rising or securities  prices are falling,  the
Fund can  seek to  offset  a  decline  in the  value  of its  current  portfolio
securities  through  the sale of  futures  contracts.  When  interest  rates are
falling or  securities  prices are rising,  the Fund,  through  the  purchase of
futures contracts, can attempt to secure better rates or prices than might later
be available in the market when it effects anticipated purchases. Similarly, the
Fund can sell  futures  contracts on a specified  currency to protect  against a
decline  in the  value  of such  currency  and a  decline  in the  value  of its
portfolio  securities  which  are  denominated  in such  currency.  The Fund can
purchase  futures  contracts on foreign  currency to establish the price in U.S.
dollars of a security denominated in such currency that the Fund has acquired or
expects to acquire.                                                             

         Positions  taken  in the  futures  markets  are  not  normally  held to
maturity but are instead liquidated  through  offsetting  transactions which may
result in a profit or a loss. While futures  contracts on securities or currency
will usually be liquidated  in this manner,  the Fund may instead make, or take,
delivery  of  the  underlying   securities  or  currency   whenever  it  appears
economically  advantageous to do so. A clearing corporation  associated with the
exchange on which futures on securities or currency are traded  guarantees that,
if still open, the sale or purchase will be performed on the settlement date.   

         Hedging  Strategies.  Hedging,  by use of futures  contracts,  seeks to
establish with more certainty the effective  price,  rate of return and currency
exchange  rate on  portfolio  securities  and  securities  that the Fund owns or
proposes to acquire.  The Fund may, for example,  take a "short" position in the
futures  market  by  selling  futures  contracts  in order to hedge  against  an
anticipated  rise in  interest  rates or a decline  in market  prices or foreign
currency  rates that would  adversely  affect the value of the Fund's  portfolio
securities. Such futures contracts may include contracts for the future delivery
of securities  held by the Fund or securities  with  characteristics  similar to
those of the Fund's portfolio securities.  Similarly,  the Fund may sell futures
contracts in currency in which its portfolio  securities  are  denominated or in
one  currency  to  hedge  against   fluctuations  in  the  value  of  securities
denominated  in a  different  currency  if  there is an  established  historical
pattern of correlation  between the two  currencies.  If, in the opinion of PMC,
there is a sufficient degree of correlation  between price trends for the Fund's
portfolio securities and futures contracts based on other financial instruments,
securities  indices or other indices,  the Fund may also enter into such futures
contracts as part of its hedging  strategy.  Although  under some  circumstances
prices of securities  in the Fund's  portfolio may be more or less volatile than
prices of such  futures  contracts,  PMC will  attempt to estimate the extent of

B-4 

P-->485BPOS28th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
this volatility  difference based on historical  patterns and compensate for any
such  differential  by having the Fund enter into a greater or lesser  number of
futures contracts or by attempting to achieve only a partial hedge against price
changes  affecting  the  Fund's  securities  portfolio.  When  hedging  of  this
character is successful,  any depreciation in the value of portfolio  securities
will be  substantially  offset  by  appreciation  in the  value  of the  futures
position. On the other hand, any unanticipated  appreciation in the value of the
Fund's portfolio  securities  would be substantially  offset by a decline in the
value of the futures position.                                                  

         On other  occasions,  the Fund may take a "long" position by purchasing
futures  contracts.  This would be done, for example,  when the Fund anticipates
the subsequent purchase of particular securities when it has the necessary cash,
but  expects  the  prices or  currency  exchange  rates  then  available  in the
applicable  market to be less  favorable than prices or rates that are currently
available.                                                                      

         Options on Futures  Contracts.  The acquisition of put and call options
on futures contracts will give the Fund the right (but not the obligation) for a
specified  price to sell or to purchase,  respectively,  the underlying  futures
contract at any time during the option period.  As the purchaser of an option on
a futures  contract,  the Fund  obtains the  benefit of the futures  position if
prices move in a favorable direction but limits its risk of loss in the event of
an unfavorable price movement to the loss of the premium and transaction costs. 

         The writing of a call option on a futures contract  generates a premium
which may  partially  offset a decline  in the value of the  Fund's  assets.  By
writing a call option, the Fund becomes obligated,  in exchange for the premium,
to sell a futures  contract,  which may have a value  higher  than the  exercise
price. Conversely, the writing of a put option on a futures contract generates a
premium which may partially  offset an increase in the price of securities  that
the Fund intends to purchase.  However, the Fund becomes obligated to purchase a
futures contract which may have a value lower than the exercise price. Thus, the
loss incurred by the Fund in writing options on futures is potentially unlimited
and may  exceed  the  amount  of the  premium  received.  The  Fund  will  incur
transaction costs in connection with the writing of options on futures.         

         The holder or writer of an option on a futures  contract may  terminate
its position by selling or purchasing  an offsetting  option on the same series.
There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected. The Fund's
ability to establish  and close out positions on such options will be subject to
the development and maintenance of a liquid market.                             

         The Fund may use options on futures  contracts for bona fide hedging or
non-hedging purposes as discussed below.                                        

         Other  Considerations.  The Fund will  engage in  futures  and  related
options  transactions  only for bona fide  hedging or  non-hedging  purposes  in
accordance  with CFTC  regulations  which  permit  principals  of an  investment
company  registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act") to engage in such transactions without registering as commodity pool
operators.  The Fund is not permitted to engage in speculative  futures trading.
The Fund will determine that the price fluctuations in the futures contracts and
options on futures used for hedging purposes are substantially  related to price
fluctuations  in  securities  held by the Fund or which it expects to  purchase.
Except as stated below, the Fund's futures transactions will be entered into for
traditional  hedging purposes -- i.e., futures contracts will be sold to protect
against a decline in the price of securities  (or the currency in which they are
denominated)  that the Fund owns,  or futures  contracts  will be  purchased  to
protect the Fund against an increase in the price of securities (or the currency
in which they are  denominated)  it intends to  purchase.  As  evidence  of this
hedging  intent,  the Fund expects that on 75% or more of the occasions on which
it takes a long futures or option  position  (involving  the purchase of futures
contracts),  the  Fund  will  have  purchased,  or  will  be in the  process  of
purchasing,  equivalent  amounts of related  securities or assets denominated in
the  related  currency in the cash market at the time when the futures or option
position is closed out.  However,  in particular  cases, when it is economically
advantageous for the Fund to do so, a long futures position may be terminated or
an option may expire without the  corresponding  purchase of securities or other
assets.                                                                         

         As an  alternative  to literal  compliance  with the bona fide  hedging
definition,  a CFTC  regulation  permits  the  Fund to elect  to  comply  with a
different test, under which the sum of the amounts of initial margin deposits on
the  Fund's  existing  non-hedging  futures  contracts  and  premiums  paid  for
non-hedging  options on futures  (net of the  amount the  positions  are "in the
money") would exceed 5% of the market value of the Fund's total assets. The Fund
will engage in transactions in futures contracts and related options only to the
B-5 

P-->485BPOS29th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
extent such  transactions  are consistent with the  requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for maintaining its qualification
as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes.              

         Transaction costs associated with futures contracts and related options
involve  brokerage costs,  require margin deposits and, in the case of contracts
and options  obligating the Fund to purchase  securities or currencies,  require
the Fund to segregate assets to cover such contracts and options.               

         While  transactions  in futures  contracts  and  options on futures may
reduce certain risks, such  transactions  themselves entail certain other risks.
Thus, while the Fund may benefit from the use of futures and options on futures,
unanticipated changes in interest rates,  securities prices or currency exchange
rates may result in a poorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not
entered into any futures contracts or options  transactions.  In the event of an
imperfect  correlation between a futures position and a portfolio position which
is intended to be protected,  the desired protection may not be obtained and the
Fund may be exposed to risk of loss.                                            

         Perfect  correlation between the Fund's futures positions and portfolio
positions  will be difficult to achieve  because no futures  contracts  based on
foreign  corporate equity securities are currently  available.  The only futures
contracts  available to hedge the Fund's  portfolio are various  futures on U.S.
Government securities and foreign currencies,  futures on a municipal securities
index and stock index futures. In addition, it is not possible to hedge fully or
perfectly  against the effect of currency  fluctuations  on the value of foreign
securities because currency  movements impact the value of different  securities
in differing degrees.                                                           

Restricted Securities                                                           

         The Fund may invest no more than 5% of its total assets in  "restricted
securities"  (i.e.,  securities that would be required to be registered prior to
distribution to the public), excluding restricted securities eligible for resale
to certain  institutional  investors pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act
of 1933 or  foreign  securities  which are  offered or sold  outside  the United
States; provided,  however, that no more than 15% of the Fund's total assets may
be invested in restricted  securities  including  securities eligible for resale
under Rule 144A. The Board of Trustees may adopt  guidelines and delegate to the
Manager the daily  function of  determining  and  monitoring  the  liquidity  of
restricted securities.  The Board, however, will retain sufficient oversight and
be ultimately  responsible for the  determinations.  Since it is not possible to
predict with assurance  exactly how this market for restricted  securities  sold
and offered under Rule 144A will develop,  the Board will carefully  monitor the
Fund's  investments in these  securities,  focusing on such  important  factors,
among others,  as valuation,  liquidity and  availability of  information.  This
investment practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity
in the Fund to the extent that qualified  institutional buyers become for a time
uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities.                         

Repurchase Agreements                                                           

         The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with "primary dealers" in
U.S. Government  securities and member banks of the Federal Reserve System which
furnish  collateral  at least  equal in value or market  price to the  amount of
their repurchase obligation.  The Fund may also enter into repurchase agreements
involving certain foreign government securities.  In a repurchase agreement,  an
investor  (e.g.,  the  Fund)  purchases  a debt  security  from a  seller  which
undertakes to repurchase  the security at a specified  resale price on an agreed
future date (ordinarily a week or less). The resale price generally  exceeds the
purchase price by an amount which reflects an agreed-upon  market  interest rate
for the term of the  repurchase  agreement.  The  primary  risk is that,  if the
seller  defaults,  the Fund might  suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds
from the sale of the underlying securities and other collateral held by the Fund
in connection with the related repurchase agreement are less than the repurchase
price.  Another risk is that, in the event of bankruptcy of the seller, the Fund
could be delayed or prohibited  from disposing of the underlying  securities and
other  collateral  held by the Fund in  connection  with the related  repurchase
agreement pending court proceedings. In evaluating whether to enter a repurchase

         (1) Issue senior securities, except as permitted by paragraphs (2), (6)
and (7) below.  For  purposes  of this  restriction,  the  issuance of shares of
beneficial  interest  in  multiple  classes or series,  the  purchase or sale of
options,   futures   contracts  and  options  on  futures   contracts,   forward
commitments,  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts,  repurchase  agreements and
reverse  repurchase  agreements  entered  into in  accordance  with  the  Fund's
investment  policy,  and the  pledge,  mortgage or  hypothecation  of the Fund's
assets  within the  meaning of  paragraph  (3) below are not deemed to be senior
securities.                                                                     

         (2)  Borrow  money,  except  from  banks  as a  temporary  measure  for
extraordinary  emergency  purposes  and except  pursuant  to reverse  repurchase
agreements  and then only in amounts  not to exceed 33 1/3% of the Fund's  total
assets  (including the amount borrowed) taken at market value. The Fund will not
use  leverage  to  attempt  to  increase  income.  The Fund  will  not  purchase
securities while outstanding borrowings exceed 5% of the Fund's total assets.   

         (3) Pledge,  mortgage,  or  hypothecate  its  assets,  except to secure
indebtedness  permitted by paragraph  (2) above and then only if such  pledging,
mortgaging or  hypothecating  does not exceed 33 1/3% of the Fund's total assets
taken at market value.                                                          

         (4) Act as an  underwriter,  except to the extent that,  in  connection
with the  disposition of portfolio  securities,  the Fund may be deemed to be an
underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933.                         

         (5) Purchase or sell real estate,  or any  interest  therein,  and real
estate  mortgage  loans,  except  that the  Fund may  invest  in  securities  of
corporate  or  governmental  entities  secured  by  real  estate  or  marketable
interests  therein or  securities  issued by  companies  (other than real estate
limited partnerships) that invest in real estate or interests therein.          

         (6) Make loans,  except that the Fund may lend portfolio  securities in
accordance  with the Fund's  investment  policies.  The Fund does not,  for this
purpose,  consider  the  purchase  or  invest  in  repurchase  agreements,  bank
certificates of deposit,  a portion of an issue of publicly  distributed  bonds,
bank loan participation  agreements,  bankers' acceptances,  debentures or other
securities,  whether or not the purchase is made upon the  original  issuance of
the securities, to be the making of a loan.                                     

         (7) Invest in commodities or commodity  contracts or in puts, calls, or
combinations  of both,  except  interest  rate  futures  contracts,  options  on

financial  instruments  and options on such futures  contracts,  forward foreign
currency exchange contracts,  forward commitments,  securities index put or call
warrants and repurchase  agreements  entered into in accordance  with the Fund's
investment policies.                                                            

         (8) With respect to 75% of its total assets,  purchase securities of an
issuer (other than the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities), if  

                  (a) such purchase would cause more than 5% of the Fund's total
         assets taken at market value to be invested in the  securities  of such
issuer, or                                                    

                  (b) such purchase would at the time result in more than 10% of
         the  outstanding  voting  securities  of such issuer  being held by the
Fund.                                                         

         As long as the Fund is registered in the Federal Republic of Germany or
in Austria, the Fund may not without the prior approval of its shareholders:    

         (i)  invest  in  the  securities  of  any  other  domestic  or  foreign
investment  company or  investment  fund,  except in  connection  with a plan of
merger or consolidation  with or acquisition of substantially  all the assets of
such other investment company or investment fund;                               

         (ii) purchase or sell real estate,  or any interest  therein,  and real
estate  mortgage  loans,  except  that the  Fund may  invest  in  securities  of
corporate  or  governmental  entities  secured  by  real  estate  or  marketable
interests  therein or  securities  issued by  companies  (other than real estate
limited partnerships,  real estate investment trusts and real estate funds) that
invest in real estate or interests therein;                                     

         (iii) borrow money in amounts  exceeding 10% of the Fund's total assets
(including the amount borrowed) taken at market value;                          

B-7 

P-->485BPOS31st�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
         (iv) pledge,  mortgage or hypothecate  its assets in amounts  exceeding
10% of the Fund's total assets taken at market value;                           

(v) purchase securities on margin or make short sales; or     

(vi) redeem its securities in-kind.                           

         It is the  fundamental  policy  of the  Fund  not  to  concentrate  its
investments  in  securities  of companies  in any  particular  industry.  In the
opinion  of  the  staff  of  the   Securities  and  Exchange   Commission   (the
"Commission"),  investments are  concentrated  in a particular  industry if such
investments  aggregate 25% or more of the Fund's total assets. The Fund's policy
does not apply to investments in U.S. Government Securities.                    

         The Fund does not intend to enter into any reverse repurchase agreement
as described in fundamental investment restriction (2) above, during the current
fiscal year.                                                                    

         In addition,  as a matter of  nonfundamental  investment  policy and in
connection  with the  offering  of its  shares in  various  states  and  foreign
countries, the Fund has agreed not to:                                          

         (a) Participate on a joint-and-several  basis in any securities trading
account.  The  "bunching"  of  orders  for the sale or  purchase  of  marketable
portfolio  securities with other accounts under the management of the Adviser to
save  commissions  or to average  prices among them is not deemed to result in a
securities trading account.                                                     

         (b)  Purchase  securities  of  any  issuer  which,  together  with  any
predecessor,  has a record of less than three years' continuous operations prior
to the purchase if such purchase would cause investments of the Fund in all such
issuers to exceed 5% of the value of the total assets of the Fund.              

         (c) Invest for the purpose of exercising  control over or management of
any company.                                                                    

         (d) Purchase warrants of any issuer, if, as a result of such purchases,
more  than 2% of the value of the  Fund's  total  assets  would be  invested  in
warrants  which are not listed on the New York Stock  Exchange  or the  American
Stock  Exchange  or more than 5% of the  value of the  total  assets of the Fund
would be  invested in warrants  generally,  whether or not so listed.  For these
purposes,  warrants  are to be  valued  at the  lesser  of cost or  market,  but
warrants acquired by the Fund in units with or attached to debt securities shall
be deemed to be without value.                                                  

         (e) Knowingly purchase or retain securities of an issuer if one or more
of the  Trustees or officers of the Fund or directors or officers of the Adviser
or any  investment  management  subsidiary  of  the  Adviser  individually  owns
beneficially  more than 0.5% and together own  beneficially  more than 5% of the
securities of such issuer.                                                      

         (f)  Purchase  interests  in  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  leases  or
exploration programs;  however, this policy will not prohibit the acquisition of
securities of companies engaged in the production or transmission of oil, gas or
other minerals.  These  restrictions  may not be changed without the approval of
the regulatory agencies in such states or foreign countries.                    

         (g) Purchase any security,  including any repurchase agreement maturing
in more than seven days,  which is illiquid,  if more than 15% of the net assets
of the Fund, taken at market value, would be invested in such securities.       

         (h) Invest more than 5% of its total assets in  restricted  securities,
excluding restricted  securities eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under
the  Securities  Act of 1933;  provided,  however,  that no more than 15% of the
Fund's  total  assets  may  be  invested  in  restricted   securities  including
restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.                      

         (i) Write covered calls or put options with respect to more than 25% of
the value of its total  assets  or  invest  more than 5% of its total  assets in
puts, calls, spreads, or straddles, other than protective put options.          

2.       MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND 

         The  Fund's  Board of  Trustees  provides  broad  supervision  over the
affairs of the Fund.  The  officers of the Fund are  responsible  for the Fund's
operations.  The Trustees and  executive  officers of the Fund are listed below,

        Any such fees and expenses paid to  affiliates or interested  persons of
PMC, PFD or PSC are reimbursed to the Fund under its Management Contract.  As of
the date of this Statement of Additional Information,  the Trustees and officers
of the Fund owned  beneficially in the aggregate less than 1% of the outstanding
shares of the Fund. As of such date, Merrill Lynch Pierce,  Fenner & Smith Inc.,
Mutual  Fund  Operations,  4800 Deer Lake  Drive East 3rd FL,  Jacksonville,  FL
32246-6484 owned 10.98% of the outstanding shares (139,580 shares) of the Fund. 

3.      INVESTMENT ADVISER 

        As  stated  in  the   Prospectus,   PMC,   60  State   Street,   Boston,
Massachusetts,  serves as the Fund's investment adviser. The management contract
expires initially on June 30, 1994, but it is renewable annually after such date
by the vote of a majority  of the Board of  Trustees  of the Fund  (including  a
majority  of the  Board of  Trustees  who are not  parties  to the  contract  or
interested  persons of any such parties) cast in person at a meeting  called for
the purpose of voting on such renewal.  This contract terminates if assigned and
may be  terminated  without  penalty  by  either  party by vote of its  Board of
Directors or Trustees or a majority of its outstanding voting securities and the
giving of sixty days' written notice.                                           

        As compensation for its management  services and expenses incurred,  PMC
is  entitled  to a  management  fee at the rate of 1.00% per annum of the Fund's
average daily net assets up to $300 million,  0.85% of the next $200 million and
0.75% of the excess over $500 million.  The fee is normally  computed  daily and
paid monthly.  PMC  voluntarily  agreed not to impose its  management fee and to
make other  arrangements  to limit  certain  other  expenses  of the Fund to the
extent  required  to limit the Class A shares'  total  expenses  to 1.75% of the
average  daily net assets  attributable  to such class for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 1993. This agreement expired November 30, 1993.                    

        During the period from April 1, 1993  (commencement  of  operations)  to
November 30, 1993, the Fund did not pay any management fees. The Fund would have
incurred  management  fees  payable  to PMC of  $227,487  had the fee  reduction
agreement not been in place. During the fiscal year ended November 30, 1994, the
Fund incurred management fees of $2,256,822.                                    

        PMC has agreed that if in any fiscal year the aggregate  expenses of the
Fund exceed the expense limitation  established by any state having jurisdiction
over the Fund,  PMC will  reduce its  management  fee to the extent  required by
state law. The most restrictive state expense limit currently  applicable to the
Fund provides that the Fund's expenses in any fiscal year may not exceed 2.5% of
the first $30 million of average daily net assets,  2.0% of the next $70 million
of such assets and 1.5% of such assets in excess of $100  million.  In the past,
the relevant state has granted relief for international funds, such as the Fund,
because of their  higher  operations  costs,  and the Fund  expects to seek such
relief to the extent it becomes necessary to do so.                             

4.      PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER 

        PFD  serves  as  the  principal   underwriter  in  connection  with  the
continuous  offering  of the  shares  of the Fund  pursuant  to an  Underwriting
Agreement, dated March 25, 1993. The Trustees who were not interested persons of
the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act, approved the Underwriting Agreement, which
will continue in effect from year to year, if annually approved by the Trustees,
in  conjunction  with  the  continuance  of  the  Plans  of  Distribution.   See
"Distribution  Plans" below. The Underwriting  Agreement  provides that PFD will
bear certain distribution expenses not borne by the Fund. During the period from
April  1,  1993   (commencement   of  operations)  to  November  30,  1993,  net
underwriting   commissions   earned  by  PFD  were   approximately   $2,284,595.
Commissions   reallowed  to  dealers  during  such  period  were   approximately
$2,111,094.  During the fiscal year ended  November 30, 1994,  net  underwriting
commissions earned by PFD were approximately $821,023.  Commissions reallowed to
dealers during such period were approximately $7,070,381.                       

        PFD  bears  all  expenses  it incurs  in  providing  services  under the
Underwriting Agreement.  Such expenses include compensation to its employees and
representatives and to securities dealers for distribution related services. PFD
also pays certain  expenses in connection  with the  distribution  of the Fund's
shares,  including the cost of preparing,  printing and distributing advertising
or promotional materials, and the cost of printing and distributing prospectuses

B-12

P-->485BPOS36th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
and  supplements  to  prospective  shareholders.  The  Fund  bears  the  cost of
registering  its shares under  federal,  state and foreign  securities  law. See
"Distribution Plans" below.                                                     

        The Fund and PFD have agreed to  indemnify  each other  against  certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Under the  Underwriting  Agreement,  PFD will use its best  efforts in rendering
services to the Fund.                                                           

        The Fund will not generally  issue Fund shares for  consideration  other
than cash. At the Fund's sole discretion,  however, it may issue Fund shares for
consideration  other than cash in  connection  with a bona fide  reorganization,
statutory  merger or other  acquisition  of  portfolio  securities  (other  than
municipal  debt  securities  issued  by state  political  subdivisions  or their
agencies or  instrumentalities)  provided (i) the securities meet the investment
objectives  and policies of the Fund;  (ii) the  securities  are acquired by the
Fund for investment  and not for resale;  (ii) the securities are not restricted
as to transfer  either by law or  liquidity of market;  and (iv) the  securities
have a value  which  is  readily  ascertainable  (and  not  established  only by
evaluation  procedures) as evidenced by a listing on the American Stock exchange
or the New  York  Stock  Exchange  or by  quotation  under  the  NASD  Automated
Quotation  System. An exchange of securities for Fund shares will generally be a
taxable transaction to the shareholder.                                         

5.      DISTRIBUTION PLANS 

        The Fund has  adopted  a plan of  distribution  pursuant  to Rule  12b-1
promulgated  by the SEC under the 1940 Act with  respect to Class A shares  (the
"Class A Plan") and a plan of  distribution  with respect to Class B shares (the
"Class B Plan") (together, the "Plans").                                        

Class A Plan                                                                    

        Pursuant  to the  Class  A Plan  the  Fund  may  reimburse  PFD  for its
expenditures in financing any activity  primarily intended to result in the sale
of the Class A Plan shares.  Certain  categories of such  expenditures have been
approved  by the  Board of  Trustees  and are set forth in the  Prospectus.  See
"Distribution Plans" in the Prospectus. The expenses of the Fund pursuant to the
Class A Plan are accrued daily at a rate which may not exceed the annual rate of
0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class A shares. The
Fund  commenced  accruing  expenses  under the Class A Plan on  January 1, 1994.
During the fiscal  period ended  November  30, 1994,  the Fund did not incur any
expenses pursuant to the Class A Plan.                                          

Class B Plan                                                                    

        The Class B Plan  provides  that the Fund  shall pay PFD,  as the Fund's
distributor for its Class B shares, a daily  distribution fee equal on an annual
basis to 0.75% of the Fund's  average daily net assets  attributable  to Class B
shares and will pay PFD a service fee equal to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily
net  assets  attributable  to  Class B  shares  (which  PFD  will in turn pay to
securities  dealers which enter into a sales  agreement with PFD at a rate of up
to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets  attributable  to Class B shares
owned by investors  for whom that  securities  dealer is the holder or dealer of
record).  This service fee is intended to be consideration for personal services
and/or account maintenance services rendered by the dealer with respect to Class
B shares. PFD will advance to dealers the first-year service fee at a rate equal
to 0.25% of the amount invested.  As compensation  therefor,  PFD may retain the
service  fee paid by the Fund with  respect  to such  shares  for the first year
after purchase.  Dealers will become  eligible for additional  service fees with
respect to such shares  commencing in the thirteenth  month following  purchase.
Dealers  may from time to time be  required to meet  certain  other  criteria in
order to receive  service fees. PFD or its affiliates are entitled to retain all
service  fees  payable  under the  Class B Plan for which  there is no dealer of
record  or for  which  qualification  standards  have not  been  met as  partial
consideration  for  personal  services  and/or  account   maintenance   services
performed by PFD or its affiliates for shareholder accounts.                    

        The purpose of distribution payments to PFD under the Class B Plan is to
compensate PFD for its  distribution  services to the Fund. PFD pays commissions
to dealers as well as  expenses of printing  prospectuses  and reports  used for
sales  purposes,  expenses with respect to the preparation and printing of sales
literature  and  other  distribution   related  expenses,   including,   without
limitation,  the cost  necessary  to provide  distribution-related  services  or
personnel, travel, office expenses and equipment. The Class B Plan also provides
that  PFD  will  receive  all  CDSC's  attributable  to  Class  B  shares.  (See
"Distribution Plans" in the Prospectus.)

General                                                                         

        In accordance with the terms of the Plans,  PFD provides to the Fund for
review by the Trustees a quarterly  written report of the amounts expended under
the respective  Plan and the purpose for which such  expenditures  were made. In
the Trustees'  quarterly  review of the Plans,  they will consider the continued
appropriateness  and the  level  of  reimbursement  or  compensation  the  Plans
provide.                                                                        

        No interested person of the Fund, nor any Trustee of the Fund who is not
an interested person of the Fund, has any direct or indirect  financial interest
in the  operation  of the Plans except to the extent that PFD and certain of its
employees  may be deemed to have such an  interest  as a result of  receiving  a
portion of the  amounts  expended  under the Plans by the Fund and except to the
extent certain officers may have an interest in PFD's ultimate parent, PGI.     

        The Plans  were  adopted by a  majority  vote of the Board of  Trustees,
including  all of the Trustees who are not, and were not at the time they voted,
interested  persons of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (none of whom has or
have any direct or indirect  financial  interest in the  operation of the Plans)
(the "Qualified  Trustees"),  cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose
of voting on the Plans.  In approving  the Plans,  the Trustees  identified  and
considered a number of potential benefits which the Plans may provide. The Board
of Trustees  believes that there is a reasonable  likelihood that the Plans will
benefit the Fund and its current and future shareholders. Under their terms, the
Plans remain in effect from year to year provided such  continuance  is approved
annually by vote of the Trustees in the manner  described  above.  The Plans may
not be amended  to  increase  materially  the annual  percentage  limitation  of
average net assets which may be spent for the services described therein without
approval  of the  shareholders  of  the  Fund  affected  thereby,  and  material
amendments  of the Plans must also be  approved  by the  Trustees  in the manner
described  above. A Plan may be terminated at any time,  without  payment of any
penalty,  by vote of the majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons
of the Fund and have no direct or indirect  financial interest in the operations
of the Plan, or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding  voting securities of
the  respective  Class of the Fund (as  defined  in the 1940  Act).  A Plan will
automatically  terminate in the event of its  assignment (as defined in the 1940
Act). In the  Trustees'  quarterly  review of the Plans,  they will consider the
Plans' continued appropriateness and the level of compensation they provide.    

        During the fiscal year ended  November 30, 1994, the Fund incurred total
distribution  fees of $533,084 and $66,254  pursuant to the Class A Plan and the
Class B Plan, respectively.                                                     

6.      SHAREHOLDER SERVICING/TRANSFER AGENT 

        The Fund has contracted with Pioneering Services Corporation ("PSC"), 60
State Street, Boston,  Massachusetts,  to act as shareholder servicing agent and
transfer  agent for the Fund.  This  contract  terminates if assigned and may be
terminated  without penalty by either party by vote of its Board of Directors or
Trustees or a majority of its  outstanding  voting  securities and the giving of
ninety days' written notice.                                                    

        Under  the  terms of its  contract  with  the  Fund,  PSC  will  service
shareholder  accounts,  and its  duties  will  include:  (i)  processing  sales,
redemptions and exchanges of shares of the Fund; (ii) distributing dividends and
capital gains  associated with Fund portfolio  accounts;  and (iii)  maintaining
account records and responding to routine shareholder inquiries.                

        PSC receives an annual fee of $20.83 per Class A and Class B shareholder
account from the Fund as compensation for the services described above. This fee
is set at an amount determined by vote of a majority of the Trustees  (including
a majority  of the  Trustees  who are not  parties to the  contract  with PSC or
interested  persons  of any  such  parties)  to be  comparable  to fees for such
services being paid by other investment companies.                              

7.      CUSTODIAN 

        Brown Brothers  Harriman & Co. (the "Custodian") is the custodian of the
Fund's  assets.  The  Custodian's   responsibilities   include  safekeeping  and
controlling  the Fund's cash and  securities  in the United States as well as in
Foreign  Countries,  handling  the  receipt  and  delivery  of  securities,  and
collecting  interest and  dividends  on the Fund's  investments.  The  Custodian

B-14

P-->485BPOS38th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
fulfills its  function in Foreign  Countries  through a network of  subcustodian
banks located in the Foreign Countries (the "Subcustodians"). The Custodian also
provides fund  accounting,  bookkeeping  and pricing  assistance to the Fund and
assistance in arranging  for forward  currency  exchange  contracts as described
above under "Investment Policies and Restrictions."                             

        The Custodian does not determine the investment  policies of the Fund or
decide which  securities it will buy or sell.  The Fund may invest in securities
issued  by  the  Custodian  or any of the  Subcustodians,  deposit  cash  in the
Custodian  or  any  Subcustodian  and  deal  with  the  Custodian  or any of the
Subcustodians as a principal in securities  transactions.  Portfolio  securities
may be deposited into the Federal Reserve-Treasury  Department Book Entry System
or the  Depository  Trust Company in the United States or in recognized  central
depositories in Foreign Countries. In selecting Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. as
the  Custodian  for Foreign  Countries  Securities,  the Board of Trustees  made
certain  determinations  required by Rule 17f-5  promulgated under the 1940 Act.
The  Trustees  will  annually  review  and  approve  the  continuations  of  its
international subcustodian arrangements.                                        

8.      INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 

        Arthur  Andersen  LLP  is  the  Fund's  independent  public  accountant,
providing audit  services,  tax return review,  and assistance and  consultation
with respect to the preparation of filings with the Commission.                 

9.      PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 

        All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio  securities  are placed
on behalf of the Fund by PMC pursuant to authority  contained in the  Management
Contract.  In selecting brokers or dealers, PMC considers other factors relating
to best  execution,  including,  but not  limited  to,  the size and type of the
transaction;  the nature and  character  of the  markets of the  security  to be
purchased  or  sold;  the  execution  efficiency,   settlement  capability,  and
financial condition of the dealer; the dealer's execution services rendered on a
continuing  basis;  and  the   reasonableness   of  any  dealer  spreads.   Most
transactions  in foreign  equity  securities are executed by  broker-dealers  in
foreign  countries in which commission rates are fixed and,  therefore,  are not
negotiable  (as such rates are in the United  States) and are  generally  higher
than in the United States.                                                      

        PMC may select  broker-dealers  which provide  brokerage and/or research
services to the Fund and/or other  investment  companies or accounts  managed by
PMC. Such services may include advice  concerning  the value of securities;  the
advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities; the availability
of securities or the  purchasers or sellers of securities;  furnishing  analyses
and reports concerning  issuers,  industries,  securities,  economic factors and
trends, portfolio strategy and performance of accounts; and effecting securities
transactions and performing  functions incidental thereto (such as clearance and
settlement). PMC maintains a listing of broker-dealers who provide such services
on a regular basis. However, because many transactions on behalf of the Fund and
other  investment   companies  or  accounts  managed  by  PMC  are  placed  with
broker-dealers  (including  broker-dealers on the listing) without regard to the
furnishing of such  services,  it is not possible to estimate the  proportion of
such  transactions  directed to such dealers  solely  because such services were
provided.  Management  believes that no exact dollar value can be calculated for
such services.                                                                  

        The  research  received  from  broker-dealers  may be  useful  to PMC in
rendering  investment  management  services  to the  Fund as  well  as to  other
investment  companies  or  accounts  managed  by PMC,  although  not all of such
research may be useful to the Fund.  Conversely,  such  information  provided by
brokers or dealers who have executed  transaction orders on behalf of such other
accounts may be useful to PMC in carrying out its  obligations  to the Fund. The
receipt of such  research  has not reduced  PMC's  normal  independent  research
activities; however, it enables PMC to avoid the additional expenses which might
otherwise  be  incurred if it was to attempt to develop  comparable  information
through its own staff.                                                          

        In  circumstances  where  two or more  broker-dealers  offer  comparable
prices and executions, preference may be given to a broker-dealer which has sold
shares of the Fund as well as shares of other  investment  companies or accounts
managed by PMC. This policy does not imply a commitment to execute all portfolio
transactions  through  all  broker-dealers  that sell  shares  of the  Fund.  In

B-15

P-->485BPOS39th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
addition, if PMC determines in good faith that the amount of commissions charged
by a broker is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research
services provided by such broker, the Fund may pay commissions to such broker in
an amount greater than the amount another firm may charge.                      

        The   Trustees    periodically   review   PMC's   performance   of   its
responsibilities  in connection with the placement of portfolio  transactions on
behalf of the Fund.                                                             

        In addition  to the Fund,  PMC acts as  investment  adviser to the other
Pioneer Funds and certain private accounts with investment objectives similar to
those of the Fund. As such,  securities  may meet  investment  objectives of the
Fund, such other funds and such private accounts. In such cases, the decision to
recommend to purchase for one fund or account  rather than another is based on a
number of  factors.  The  determining  factors  in most  cases are the amount of
securities of the issuer then outstanding, the value of those securities and the
market for them.  Other  factors  considered in the  investment  recommendations
include  other  investments  which each  company  presently  has in a particular
industry or country and the  availability  of  investment  funds in each fund or
account.                                                                        

        It is possible that, at times, identical securities will be held by more
than one fund and/or  account.  However,  the position of any fund or account in
the same  issue may vary and the  length of time  that any fund or  account  may
choose to hold its investment in the same issue may likewise vary. To the extent
that the Fund, another fund in the Pioneer group or a private account managed by
PMC seeks to acquire the same security at about the same time,  the Fund may not
be able to acquire as large a position in such  security as it desires or it may
have to pay a higher price for the security. Similarly, the Fund may not be able
to obtain as large an  execution  of an order to sell or as high a price for any
particular  portfolio  security  if PMC  decides  to sell on behalf  of  another
account the same portfolio  security at the same time. On the other hand, if the
same  securities  are bought or sold at the same time by more than one  account,
the  resulting   participation  in  volume  transactions  could  produce  better
executions  for the Fund or other  account.  In the  event  that  more  than one
account  purchases or sells the same security on a given date, the purchases and
sales  will  normally  be made as nearly as  practicable  on a pro rata basis in
proportion to the amounts desired to be purchased or sold by each.              

        The   Trustees    periodically   review   PMC's   performance   of   its
responsibilities  in connection  with  portfolio  transactions  on behalf of the
Fund.                                                                           

        During the period from April 1, 1993  (commencement  of  operations)  to
November 30, 1993 and for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1994, the Fund paid
or  owed   aggregate   brokerage   commissions   of  $533,000  and   $3,903,539,
respectively.                                                                   

10.     TAX STATUS 

        It is the Fund's policy to meet the  requirements of Subchapter M of the
Code for qualification as a regulated  investment company. If the Fund meets all
such  requirements  and  distributes to its  shareholders  at least annually all
investment  company  taxable  income  and net  capital  gain,  if any,  which it
receives,  the Fund will be relieved of the necessity of paying  federal  income
tax.                                                                            

        In order to qualify as a regulated  investment  company under Subchapter
M, the Fund must,  among other  things,  derive at least 90% of its annual gross
income from  dividends,  interest,  gains from the sale or other  disposition of
stock,  securities or foreign currencies,  or other income (including gains from
options,  futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of
investing in such stock, securities or currencies (the "90% income test"), limit
its gains from the sale of stock,  securities and certain other investments held
for less than three months to less than 30% of its annual gross income (the "30%
test") and satisfy  certain annual  distribution  and quarterly  diversification
requirements.                                                                   

        Dividends from net investment  income, net short-term capital gains, and
certain net foreign  exchange  gains are  taxable as  ordinary  income,  whether
received in cash or in additional  shares.  Dividends from net long-term capital
gains, if any, whether received in cash or additional shares, are taxable to the
Fund's  shareholders as long-term  capital gains for federal income tax purposes
without  regard to the  length of time  shares of the Fund have been  held.  The
federal income tax status of all distributions  will be reported to shareholders
annually.                                                                       
B-16

P-->485BPOS40th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
         Any dividend  declared by the Fund in October,  November or December as
of a record date in such a month and paid during the  following  January will be
treated for federal income tax purposes as received by  shareholders on December
31 of the calendar year in which it is declared.                                

         Foreign  exchange  gains and losses  realized by the Fund in connection
with  certain   transactions   involving  foreign  currency-   denominated  debt
securities,  certain options and futures contracts relating to foreign currency,
forward  foreign  currency  contracts,   foreign  currencies,   or  payables  or
receivables  denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Section 988 of the
Code,  which  generally  causes  such gains and losses to be treated as ordinary
income  and  losses  and  may  affect  the  amount,   timing  and  character  of
distributions  to  shareholders.  Any such  transactions  that are not  directly
related to the Fund's  investment in stock or securities may increase the amount
of gain it is deemed to recognize from the sale of certain  investments held for
less than 3 months for  purposes of the 30% test and may under  future  Treasury
regulations  produce  income  not  among the types of  "qualifying  income"  for
purposes of the 90% income  test.  If the net foreign  exchange  loss for a year
were to exceed the Fund's  investment  company taxable income (computed  without
regard to such loss) the resulting overall ordinary loss for such year would not
be deductible by the Fund or its shareholders in future years.                  

         If the Fund acquires the stock of certain  non-U.S.  corporations  that
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive  sources (such as
sources that produce interest, dividend, rental, royalty or capital gain income)
or hold at least 50% of their assets in such passive sources  ("passive  foreign
investment  companies"),  the Fund could be  subject  to federal  income tax and
additional  interest  charges  on  "excess  distributions"  received  from  such
companies or gain from the sale of stock in such  companies,  even if all income
or gain actually received by the Fund is timely distributed to its shareholders.
The Fund  would not be able to pass  through to its  shareholders  any credit or
deduction for such a tax. In certain  cases,  an election may be available  that
would  ameliorate  these  adverse  tax  consequences.  The  Fund may  limit  its
investments  in  passive  foreign   investment   companies  and  will  undertake
appropriate  actions,  including  consideration of any available  elections,  to
limit its tax liability, if any, or take other defensive actions with respect to
such investments.                                                               

         Since, at the time of an investor's  purchase of Fund shares, a portion
of the per share net asset value by which the purchase  price is determined  may
be represented by realized or unrealized appreciation in the Fund's portfolio or
undistributed taxable income of the Fund, subsequent  distributions (or portions
thereof)  on such shares may be taxable to such  investor  even if the net asset
value of his shares is, as a result of the distributions, reduced below his cost
for such shares and the distributions (or portions thereof) in reality represent
a return of a portion of his investment.                                        

         Any loss realized by a shareholder upon the redemption of shares with a
tax  holding  period  at the time of  redemption  of six  months or less will be
treated as a  long-term  capital  loss to the extent of any  amounts  treated as
distributions of long-term capital gain with respect to such shares.            

         In addition, as described in the Prospectus, the tax treatment of gains
or losses on the redemption or exchange of certain Class A shares within 90 days
after their purchase may be affected by subsequent  investments in the same Fund
or another fund pursuant to a reinvestment or exchange privilege,  and losses on
certain  redemptions  may be disallowed  under "wash sale" rules in the event of
other  investments  in the Fund within 30 days before or after a  redemption  or
other sale of shares.                                                           

         For federal income tax purposes, the Fund is permitted to carry forward
a net realized  capital loss in any year to offset  realized  capital gains,  if
any,  during  the eight  years  following  the year of the loss.  To the  extent
subsequent net realized capital gains are offset by such losses,  they would not
result in federal  income tax  liability  to the Fund and are not expected to be
distributed as such to shareholders.                                            

         The  Fund's   dividends   normally   will  not   qualify  for  the  70%
dividends-received  deduction  available to corporations,  because the Fund does
not expect to receive dividends from U.S domestic corporations.                 

         The Fund may be  subject  to  withholding  and other  taxes  imposed by
foreign  countries  with  respect to its  investments  in those  countries.  Tax
conventions  between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such
taxes.  If more than 50% of the Fund's  total assets at the close of any taxable
year consists of stock or securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may elect
to pass through to shareholders their pro rata shares of qualified foreign taxes

B-17

P-->485BPOS41st�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
paid by the Fund, with the result that shareholders would be required to include
such taxes in their gross incomes (in addition to dividends  actually  received)
and would treat such taxes as foreign taxes paid by them,  for which they may be
entitled  to a tax  deduction  or credit on their own tax  returns,  subject  to
certain limitations under the Code.                                             

         Different  tax  treatment,   including   penalties  on  certain  excess
contributions  and  deferrals,   certain   pre-retirement  and   post-retirement
distributions,  and  certain  prohibited  transactions,  is accorded to accounts
maintained as qualified retirement plans.  Shareholders should consult their tax
advisers for more information.                                                  

         The Fund is not subject to Massachusetts  corporate excise or franchise
taxes and,  provided that the Fund qualifies as a regulated  investment  company
under the Code, it will not be required to pay any Massachusetts income tax.    

         Options written or purchased and futures  contracts entered into by the
Fund on certain securities,  securities indices and foreign currencies,  as well
as certain foreign currency forward  contracts,  may cause the Fund to recognize
gains or  losses  from  marking-to-market  at the end of its  taxable  year even
though such options may not have  lapsed,  been closed out, or exercised or such
futures or forward contracts may not have been closed out or disposed of and may
affect the characterization as long-term or short-term of some capital gains and
losses realized by the Fund.  Certain options,  futures and forward contracts on
foreign currency may be subject to Section 988, described above, and accordingly
produce ordinary income or loss.  Losses on certain options,  futures or forward
contracts and/or offsetting positions  (portfolio  securities or other positions
with respect to which the Fund's risk of loss is substantially diminished by one
or more options,  futures or forward  contracts)  may also be deferred under the
tax straddle rules of the Code,  which may also affect the  characterization  of
capital gains or losses from straddle positions and certain successor  positions
as  long-term  or  short-term.  The tax rules  applicable  to options,  futures,
forward  contracts and straddles may affect the amount,  timing and character of
the Fund's income and loss and hence of distributions to shareholders.          

         Federal law requires that the Fund  withhold (as "backup  withholding")
31% of reportable payments, including dividends, capital gain dividends, and the
proceeds of redemptions  (including exchanges) and repurchases,  to shareholders
who have not complied with IRS  regulations.  In order to avoid this withholding
requirement,  shareholders  must certify on their  Account  Applications,  or on
separate W-9 Forms, that their Social Security or other Taxpayer  Identification
Number is correct and that they are not currently subject to backup withholding,
or that they are exempt from backup  withholding.  The Fund may  nevertheless be
required to  withhold  if it  receives  notice from the IRS or a broker that the
number provided is incorrect or backup  withholding is applicable as a result of
previous underreporting of interest or dividend income.                         

          The  description  above  relates  only  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax
consequences  for  shareholders  who are U.S.  persons,  i.e., U.S.  citizens or
residents and U.S. domestic corporations,  partnerships,  trusts or estates, and
who are subject to U.S.  federal  income tax. The  description  does not address
special tax rules applicable to certain classes of investors, such as tax-exempt
entities,  insurance companies, and financial institutions.  Shareholders should
consult  their own tax advisers on these  matters and on state,  local and other
applicable  tax laws.  Investors  other  than U.S.  persons  may be  subject  to
different U.S. tax treatment,  including a possible 30% U.S. withholding tax (or
a lower treaty rate) on dividends treated as ordinary income.                   

11.      DESCRIPTION OF SHARES 

         The  Fund's  Declaration  of Trust  permits  the Board of  Trustees  to
authorize the issuance of an unlimited  number of full and fractional  shares of
beneficial  interest (without par value) which may be divided into such separate
series as the Trustees may establish.  Currently,  the Fund consists of only one
series. The Trustees may, however,  establish additional series of shares in the
future,  and may divide or combine the shares into a greater or lesser number of
shares without thereby changing the  proportionate  beneficial  interests in the
Fund. The  Declaration  of Trust further  authorizes the Trustees to classify or
reclassify any series of the shares into one or more classes.  Pursuant thereto,
the Trustees have  authorized the issuance of two classes of shares of the Fund,
Class A shares and Class B shares.  Each share of a class of the Fund represents
an equal  proportionate  interest  in the assets of the Fund  allocable  to that
class. Upon liquidation of the Fund,  shareholders of each class of the Fund are
entitled  to share pro rata in the  Fund's net  assets  allocable  to such class
available  for  distribution  to  shareholders.  The Fund  reserves the right to
create and issue  additional  series or  classes  of  shares,  in which case the
shares of each class of a series  would  participate  equally  in the  earnings,

B-18

P-->485BPOS42nd�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
dividends and assets allocable to that class of the particular series.          

          Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each share held and may vote
in the  election  of  Trustees  and on other  matters  submitted  to meetings of
shareholders.  Although  Trustees are not elected annually by the  shareholders,
shareholders have, under certain circumstances,  the right to remove one or more
Trustees.  No amendment  adversely  affecting the rights of shareholders  may be
made to the  Fund's  Declaration  of Trust  without  the  affirmative  vote of a
majority of its shares.  Shares have no preemptive or conversion rights.  Shares
are fully paid and  non-assessable  by the Trust,  except as stated  below.  See
"Certain Liabilities."

12.      CERTAIN LIABILITIES 

         As a Massachusetts  business trust, the Fund's  operations are governed
by its  Declaration  of Trust dated October 26, 1992, a copy of which is on file
with the Office of the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts.
Theoretically, shareholders of a Massachusetts business trust may, under certain
circumstances,  be held  personally  liable  for the  obligations  of the trust.
However,  the Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder
liability  for acts or  obligations  of the Fund or any  series  of the Fund and
provides  that  notice  of such  disclaimer  may be  given  in  each  agreement,
obligation or  instrument  entered into or executed by the Fund or its Trustees.
Moreover,  the Declaration of Trust provides for the indemnification out of Fund
property of any shareholders  held personally  liable for any obligations of the
Fund or any series of the Fund. The  Declaration of Trust also provides that the
Fund  shall,  upon  request,  assume the  defense of any claim made  against any
shareholder  for any act or  obligation  of the Fund and  satisfy  any  judgment
thereon.  Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss beyond his or
her   investment   because  of  shareholder   liability   would  be  limited  to
circumstances  in which the Fund itself will be unable to meet its  obligations.
In light of the nature of the Fund's  business  and the nature and amount of its
assets,  the  possibility of the Fund's  liabilities  exceeding its assets,  and
therefore a shareholder's risk of personal liability, is remote.                

         The Declaration of Trust further provides that the Fund shall indemnify
each of its Trustees and officers  against  liabilities and expenses  reasonably
incurred by them,  in connection  with,  or arising out of, any action,  suit or
proceeding,  threatened against or otherwise  involving such Trustee or officer,
directly or  indirectly,  by reason of being or having been a Trustee or officer
of the Fund.  The  Declaration of Trust does not authorize the Fund to indemnify
any Trustee or officer  against any liability to which he or she would otherwise
be subject by reason of or for willful misfeasance,  bad faith, gross negligence
or reckless disregard of such person's duties.                                  

13.      DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 

         The net asset  value per share of each class of the Fund is  determined
as of the close of regular trading  (currently 4:00 p.m.,  Eastern Time) on each
day on which the New York Stock  Exchange (the  "Exchange") is open for trading.
As of the date of this Statement of Additional Information, the Exchange is open
for trading every weekday  except for the  following  holidays:  New Year's Day,
Presidents'  Day,  Good  Friday,  Memorial  Day,  Independence  Day,  Labor Day,
Thanksgiving  Day and Christmas Day. The net asset value per share of each class
of the Fund is also determined on any other day in which the level of trading in
its  portfolio  securities  is  sufficiently  high so that the current net asset
value per share  might be  materially  affected  by  changes in the value of its
portfolio securities.  The Fund is not required to determine its net asset value
per  share on any day in which no  purchase  orders  for the  shares of the Fund
become effective and no shares are tendered for redemption.                     

         The net asset  value per share of each class of the Fund is computed by
taking the value of all of the Fund's assets  attributable to a class,  less the
Fund's  liabilities  attributable  to a class,  and dividing it by the number of
outstanding  shares of that class.  For purposes of determining net asset value,
expenses of the classes of the Fund are accrued daily.                          

         Securities which have not traded on the date of valuation or securities
for which sales prices are not generally reported are valued at the mean between
the last bid and asked prices.  Securities  for which no market  quotations  are
readily available (including those the trading of which has been suspended) will
be valued at fair value as  determined  in good faith by the Board of  Trustees,
although the actual  computations  may be made by persons acting pursuant to the
direction of the Board.  The maximum offering price per Class A share is the net
asset value per Class A share, plus the maximum sales charge. Class B shares are
offered at net asset value without the imposition of an initial sales charge.

14.      SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN 

         The  Systematic  Withdrawal  Plan  ("SWP")  is  designed  to  provide a
convenient  method of receiving fixed payments at regular  intervals from shares
of the Fund  deposited  by the  applicant  under this SWP.  The  applicant  must
deposit or purchase for deposit with PSC shares of the Fund having a total value
of not less  than  $10,000.  Periodic  checks of $50 or more will be sent to the
applicant,  or any person designated by him, monthly or quarterly. A designation
of a third party to receive checks requires an acceptable  signature  guarantee.
Withdrawals  from Class B share  accounts are limited to 10% of the value of the
account at the time the SWP is implemented.                                     

         Any income dividends or capital gains distributions on shares under the
SWP  will be  credited  to the  Plan  account  on the  payment  date in full and
fractional shares at the net asset value per share in effect on the record date.

         SWP payments are made from the  proceeds of the  redemption  of Class A
shares  deposited  under  the SWP in a SWP  account.  To the  extent  that  such
redemptions for periodic  withdrawals  exceed dividend income  reinvested in the
SWP account,  such redemptions will reduce and may ultimately exhaust the number
of shares deposited in the SWP account.  Redemptions are taxable transactions to
shareholders.  In  addition,  the amounts  received by a  shareholder  cannot be
considered as an actual yield or income on his or her investment because part of
such payments may be a return of his or her investment.                         

         The SWP may be terminated  at any time (1) by written  notice to PSC or
from PSC to the shareholder;  (2) upon receipt by PSC of appropriate evidence of
the shareholder's death; or (3) when all shares under the SWP been redeemed.    

15.      LETTER OF INTENTION 

         Purchases  in the Fund of $50,000 or more of Class A shares  (excluding
any  reinvestments of dividends and capital gains  distributions)  made within a
13-month period  pursuant to a Letter of Intention  provided by PFD will qualify
for a reduced  sales  charge.  Such reduced sales charge will be the charge that
would be applicable to the purchase of all Class A shares  purchased during such
13-month period pursuant to a Letter of Intention had such shares been purchased
all at once.  See "How to Buy Fund Shares" in the  Prospectus.  For  example,  a
person who signs a Letter of Intention  providing for a total investment in Fund
Class A shares of $50,000  over a 13-month  period would be charged at the 4.50%
sales charge rate with respect to all purchases  during that period.  Should the
amount actually  purchased  during the 13-month period be more or less than that
indicated  in the Letter,  an  adjustment  in the sales  charge will be made.  A
purchase not made pursuant to a Letter of Intention  may be included  thereafter
if the Letter is filed within 90 days of such purchase. Any shareholder may also
obtain the reduced  sales  charge by  including  the value (at current  offering
price) of all his shares in the Fund and all other Pioneer mutual funds,  except
the Class A shares of Pioneer Money Market Trust,  held of record as of the date
of his Letter of Intention as a credit toward  determining the applicable  scale
of sales  charge  for the Class A shares  to be  purchased  under the  Letter of
Intention.                                                                      

         The  Letter  of  Intention  authorizes  PSC to escrow  shares  having a
purchase price equal to 5% of the stated  investment in the Letter of Intention.
A Letter of Intention is not a binding obligation upon the investor to purchase,
or the Fund to sell, the full amount  indicated and the investor should read the
provisions  of the Letter of  Intention  contained  in the  Account  Application
carefully before signing.                                                       

16.      INVESTMENT RESULTS 

         One of the primary  methods used to measure the  performance of a class
of the Fund is "total  return." "Total  return"  will  normally  represent  the
percentage change in value of an account,  or of a hypothetical  investment in a
class of the Fund, over any period up to the lifetime of that class of the Fund.
Total return  calculations will usually assume the reinvestment of all dividends
and capital gains  distributions and will be expressed as a percentage  increase
or  decrease  from an initial  value,  for the entire  period or for one or more
specified periods within the entire period. Total return percentages for periods
of less than one year will usually be annualized;  total return  percentages for
periods  longer  than one year  will  usually  be  accompanied  by total  return
percentages  for each  year  within  the  period  and/or by the  average  annual
compounded total return for the period.  The income and capital  components of a

B-20

P-->485BPOS44th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
given  return may be  separated  and  portrayed in a variety of ways in order to
illustrate  their relative  significance.  Performance  may also be portrayed in
terms of cash or investment values, without percentages. Past performance cannot
guarantee any particular future result.                                         

         The Fund's average annual total return quotations for each class of its
shares as that  information  may appear in the  Prospectus,  this  Statement  of
Additional  Information  or in advertising  are  calculated by standard  methods
prescribed by the Commission.                                                   

Standardized Average Annual Total Return Quotations           

         Average  annual total return  quotations for Class A and Class B shares
are computed by finding the average annual compounded rates of return that would
cause a  hypothetical  investment  in that  class  made  on the  first  day of a
designated  period (assuming all dividends and  distributions are reinvested) to
equal the ending  redeemable value of such  hypothetical  investment on the last
day of the designated period in accordance with the following formula:          

P(1+T)n  =  ERV         

Where:           P =a hypothetical  initial payment of $1,000,  less the maximum
                 sales load of $57.50 for Class A shares or the deduction of the
   CDSC for Class B shares at the end of the period.

 T        =        average annual total return

n        =        number of years           

                 ERV     = ending  redeemable  value of the  hypothetical  $1000
                         initial payment made at the beginning of the designated
        period (or fractional portion thereof)

For  purposes of the above  computation,  it is assumed  that the maximum  sales
charge of 5.75% was deducted from the initial  investment and that all dividends
and distributions  made by the Fund are reinvested at net asset value during the
designated  period.  The average annual total return  quotation is determined to
the nearest 1/100 of 1%.                                                        

         In determining the average annual total return  (calculated as provided
above),  recurring fees, if any, that are charged to all shareholder accounts of
a particular class are taken into consideration.  For any account fees that vary
with the size of the  account,  the account  fee used for  purposes of the above
computation  is assumed  to be the fee that would be charged to the class'  mean
account size.                                                                   

         The average  annual total returns for Class A shares and Class B shares
(giving effect to the prior expense limitation) are as follows:

        Class A Shares                      3.68%                                  24.50%   4/1/93

         The total  return  figures  would be reduced if no effect were given to                     
the expense limitation previously in place.                                                          

Other Quotations, Comparisons, and General Information        

         From  time to  time,  in  advertisements,  in sales  literature,  or in
reports to  shareholders,  the past  performance  of the Fund may be illustrated
and/or  compared  with  that of  other  mutual  funds  with  similar  investment
objectives, and to stock or other relevant indices. For example, total return of
the Fund's  classes may be  compared to averages or rankings  prepared by Lipper
Analytical  Services,  Inc.,  a  widely  recognized  independent  service  which
monitors mutual fund performance;  the Europe Australia Far East Index ("EAFE"),
an unmanaged  index of  international  stock  markets,  Morgan  Stanley  Capital
International USA Index, an unmanaged index of U.S.  domestic stock markets,  or
other appropriate indices of Morgan Stanley Capital International  ("MSCI"); the
Standard & Poor's 500 Stock  Index ("S&P  500"),  an  unmanaged  index of common
stocks;  or the Dow Jones Industrial  Average,  a recognized  unmanaged index of
common stocks of 30 industrial companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

         In addition, the performance of the classes of the Fund may be compared
to alternative investment or savings vehicles and/or to indexes or indicators of
economic activity,  e.g., inflation or interest rates.  Performance rankings and

         In presenting  investment results, the Fund may also include references
to certain  financial  planning  concepts,  including (a) an investor's  need to
evaluate his financial  assets and  obligations to determine how much to invest;
(b) his need to analyze the objectives of various investments to determine where
to invest;  and (c) his need to analyze his time frame for future  capital needs
to determine how long to invest. The investor controls these three factors,  all
of which affect the use of investments in building assets.

information, including:                                                         

o    net asset value prices for all Pioneer mutual funds;   

  o    annualized 30-day yields on Pioneer's fixed income funds;

          o    annualized 7-day yields and 7-day effective (compound) yields for
Pioneer's market funds; and                       

          o    dividends and capital gains  distributions  on all Pioneer mutual
funds.                                            

Yields are  calculated in  accordance  with  standard  formulas  mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.                                             

         In  addition,   by  using  a  personal   identification  number  (PIN),
shareholders  may access their account balance and last three  transactions  and
may order a duplicate statement.                                                

         All performance  numbers  communicated  through FactFone represent past
performance;  figures for all quoted bond funds  include the maximum  applicable
sales  charge.  A  shareholder's  actual  yield and total  return will vary with
changing market conditions.  The value of Class A and Class B shares (except for
Pioneer  money  market  funds,  which seek a stable $1.00 share price) will also
vary and may be worth more or less at redemption than their original cost.

Market Capitalization                                                           

         According  to data as of December 31, 1994  supplied by Morgan  Stanley
Capital  International,  capitalization  of foreign equity markets has increased
dramatically  since 1972.  Investors  not investing in stocks traded on non-U.S.
markets  miss  over  60%  of  the  equity  investment   opportunities  available
worldwide.

Foreign and U.S. Market Performance                                             

        Overall, the performance of foreign securities markets, such as those in
the  United  Kingdom,  Germany,  Japan and  France,  has  outpaced  that of U.S.
securities markets. Although prices of international stocks fluctuate, they have
achieved a remarkably  consistent long-term performance record. Of course, there
is no guarantee they will continue to perform as well as they have in the past.

Dear Shareowners,                                                               
This second annual report for Pioneer International Growth Fund covers the      
Fund's fiscal year ended November 30, 1994. Looking outside the United States   
rewarded many investors over the past year, even though rising interest rates   
cooled the world's financial markets and increased price volatility as the      
year progressed.                                                                

How Your Fund Performed                                                         
For the 12 months ended November 30, 1994, Pioneer International Growth Fund    
generated the following results:                                                

* For investors in Class A shares -- Net asset value rose to $21.55 per share   
on November 30, versus $20.91 one year earlier. The Fund distributed a          
dividend of $0.03 per share and a capital gain of $1.39 per share in December   
1993. Assuming reinvestment of the distributions, the Fund produced a           
12-month total return of 10.03% and a lifetime average annual total return of   
29.0%, based on net asset value. Your Fund's results outpaced the average       
international growth fund. According to Lipper Analytical Services, an          
independent mutual fund research firm, the average fund returned 9.53% for      
the year and 14.60% since the Fund's inception, respectively. Lipper tracked    
153 and 123 funds for the periods.                                              

* For investors in Class B shares -- Net asset value increased to $21.45 per    
share on November 30, versus its starting value of $21.06 on April 4, 1994.     
Your Fund produced a total return of 1.85% during this period, assuming         
shares were held through November 30.                                           

For additional performance information, please turn to page 4.                  

On the whole, international stock markets performed well for the year. The      
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Europe, Australia, Far East         
(EAFE) Index, an unmanaged measure of international stock markets, showed a     
total return of 14.84% for the 12 months. This return outpaced your Fund for    
the year, due in large part to the Index's 46% weighting in Japan. (Your Fund   
is more diversified than the Index.) Both your Fund and the Index               
outperformed the major investment benchmarks here at home. The Dow Jones        
Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, two unmanaged           
measures of the U.S. stock market, gained 4.36% and 1.07% for the fiscal        
year, respectively.                                                             

Rising Interest Rates Changed World Financial Markets                           
As your Fund's fiscal year began, U.S. interest rates were near their lowest    
level in 20 years, with short-term rates around 3% and long-term rates under    
7%. Many emerging countries' markets experienced an exceptionally prosperous    
year, generating double-digit (and in some cases, triple-digit) returns for     
the record number of investors who had moved into these markets in search of    
high-growth potential. Emerging markets had become increasingly attractive      
compared to mature countries, such as the United States and Japan, which were   
experiencing sluggish economic growth and historically low interest rates.      

One year later, economic growth in most developed nations had picked up and     
short-term interest rates in the U.S. had risen to 5.5%, their highest level    
in three years. (The Federal Reserve began hiking rates in February, moving     
up rates six times during the Fund's fiscal year.) Higher U.S. rates led to     
volatility in world financial markets. Emerging markets in particular           
suffered from these rate increases; investors who had jumped quickly into       
these markets began exiting just as hastily. The result was a huge outflow of   
money from these countries, leading to increased volatility for all             
international investors. Several emerging markets within Latin America and      
Southeast Asia also suffered further declines in their markets as a result of   
heightened economic and political instabilities.                                

In Europe, investors generally saw market conditions improve over the year,     
with much of the Continent moving out of recession. Not only did the region     
see economic growth, it also benefited from investors (who had been in the      
more volatile emerging markets) taking solace in more established markets.      
Japan, despite being in the midst of a political transformation and suffering   
from periods of market declines, maintained a competitive market position,      
particularly during the first half of the Fund's fiscal year. Japan's recent    
strength is reflected by the higher value of the yen versus the U.S. dollar.    
Japanese consumers particularly benefited from the stronger yen, enabling       
them to purchase U.S. products more cheaply.

How Pioneer Managed Your Fund                                                   
As we pursue Pioneer International Growth Fund's objective of long-term         
capital growth, we try to find the best opportunities possible -- wherever      
they may be. This is why we diversify into both established and emerging        
markets; while one area may be experiencing stagnant growth, another may be     
moving out of recession. Of course, certain risks, such as currency             
fluctuations, as well as economic and political instabilities, remain an        
unavoidable part of international investing, no matter what the foreign         
market. Nonetheless, we feel the tradeoff of such risks is worthwhile,          
especially given the superior long-term gains we believe are possible.          

Sweden continues to hold our interest and remained the Fund's most              
substantial country weighting in Europe (12% on November 30, 1994), with        
several of the Fund's largest holdings. Sweden's multinational companies are    
benefiting from increased exports and global growth, and are selling at         
relatively low prices compared to the rest of Europe. Examples include Astra,   
a drug company, and Volvo, an automotive producer. Finland also has shown       
potential, experiencing a cyclical recovery that has created some good          
values. We are impressed here by Nokia, a manufacturer of cellular hand sets.   
The company already has benefited from strong global demand for its product     
line, and it continues to be a low-cost competitor.                             

On the other hand, we have minimized investments in the United Kingdom to       
just 1% of the portfolio at the Fund's fiscal year end. While the region        
continues to enjoy low interest rates and inflation, many companies there       
already have experienced higher earnings as a result of the improved economic   
environment. For this reason we have not come across many undervalued U.K.      
investments. Instead, we have found more opportunities in other areas of        
Europe -- the previously mentioned countries, as well as France and Germany     
-- whose economic recovery is not as far along as in the United Kingdom. We     
expect these nations to follow the United Kingdom's lead in terms of economic   
growth, and that companies within these areas, too, will experience positive    
movement. One company we are especially attracted to is SAP, a German           
software firm.                                                                  

In emerging markets, we began to reduce the Fund's holdings in Latin America    
and Southeast Asia, although the portfolio continued to have significant        
exposure to these regions well into the fiscal year. As a result, the quick     
and sharp downturns that occurred in some of these markets worked against the   
Fund -- just as their previous growth had worked to the Fund's advantage.       

Two areas we continue to favor, however, are Korea and Taiwan. While these      
markets also suffered as U.S. interest rates rose, they benefited from          
ongoing investment and support by local investors, which meant that liquidity   
was less of a factor than in other emerging areas. In addition, Korean and      
Taiwanese exporters gained significantly in competitiveness versus their        
Japanese counterparts during 1993 and 1994, since their currencies moved in     
line with the dollar. In Korea, we expect that the growing need for Asian       
infrastructure development will benefit the steel industry and so we added      
POSCO, a steel producer, to the portfolio. Another strong area for investment   
is the communications industry; we took a position in Korea Mobile Telecom, a   
cellular phone company. In Taiwan, we consider Tuntex, a textile                
manufacturer, to be an attractive addition to the Fund's portfolio. Holdings    
in Korea and Taiwan made up 5% and 4% of the portfolio at the end of the        
period, respectively. Of course, these weightings will vary over time as        
global valuations and our investment outlook inevitably shift.                  

As the year progressed, we began to take a more defensive position because of   
the significant volatility and liquidity in emerging markets. We opted to       
hold a higher amount of cash, as well as add to securities in established       
markets such as Japan. In fact, we increased the Fund's weighting in Japanese   
holdings to 13% on November 30, up from 0.5% one year earlier. We think the     
country's improved market strength makes it a more appealing choice than many   
lesser-developed markets, and we are looking to further augment portfolio       
holdings there. Of course, we also recognize the volatility that exists         
within the Japanese market, which is why we kept the majority of the Fund's     
Japanese holdings hedged against currency fluctuations through the period's     
end. The accompanying chart summarizes the Fund's geographical distribution     
as of November 30, 1994.

Near term, we expect concerns over additional U.S. interest rate increases to   
affect financial markets worldwide. Emerging markets, in particular, may        
continue to be volatile. Because fewer investors turn to lesser-developed       
regions in times of uncertainty (in this case, over U.S. interest rates),       
market liquidity could be an issue. Therefore, we expect to limit the Fund's    
exposure to Southeast Asia and Latin America in the near future and increase    
its exposure to Japan and Europe, especially since further U.S. interest rate   
increases cannot be ruled out.                                                  

Of course, once U.S. interest rates stabilize, we think investors again will    
seek opportunities in emerging regions, especially since stocks in many of      
these markets will have become extremely cheap. After significant price         
declines in 1994, we expect many good values to emerge in areas such as Hong    
Kong, India and Mexico, and so our longer-term plans include moving back into   
these areas. While we will remain mindful of volatility and liquidity, we are   
nonetheless optimistic about the many values that exist around the world. We    
remain committed to identifying the regions, sectors and individual companies   
we believe can offer value to Fund shareowners.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet, including the schedule of   
investments, of Pioneer International Growth Fund, as of November 30, 1994,     
and the related statement of operations, statement of changes in net assets     
and financial highlights for the periods presented. These financial             
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's        
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.                        

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing        
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and          
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of            
securities owned as of November 30, 1994, by correspondence with the            
custodian. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used      
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the         
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide    
a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                             

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred    
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of    
Pioneer International Growth Fund as of November 30, 1994, and the results of   
its operations, the changes in its net assets and financial highlights for      
the periods presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting         
principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--November 3, 1994                                 

1. Pioneer International Growth Fund (the Fund) is a Massachusetts business     
trust organized on October 26,1992 and is registered under the Investment       
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, open-end management company.              

The Board of Trustees ("Trustees") has authorized the issuance of two classes   
of the Fund, designated as Class A and Class B shares. Class B shares were      
first publicly offered on April 4, 1994. Shares issued and outstanding prior    
to April 4, 1994 were designated as Class A shares. The shares of each class    
represent an interest in the same portfolio of investments of the Fund and      
have equal rights to voting, redemption, dividend and liquidation, except       
that each class of shares can bear different transfer agent and distribution    
fees and have exclusive voting rights with respect to the distribution plans    
that have been adopted by holders of Class A and Class B shares,                
respectively.                                                                   

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the Fund,      
which are in conformity with those generally accepted in the investment         
company industry:                                                               

A. Investment Securities--Security transactions are recorded on the date the  
securities are purchased or sold. Each day, investments in securities are       
valued at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are          
traded. Securities that have not traded on the date of valuation or             
securities for which sales prices are not generally reported are valued at      
the mean between the last bid and asked prices. Securities for which market     
quotations are not readily available will be valued at their fair value as      
determined by or under the direction of the Trustees. Trading in foreign        
securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the    
close of the New York Stock Exchange. The value of such securities used in      
computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of such    
times. It is the Fund's policy to provide a reserve against net unrealized      
capital gains earned on certain foreign securities held by the Fund, on a       
daily basis. Temporary investments are stated at cost plus accrued interest,    
which approximates market value. Dividend income is recorded on the             
ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual basis net of    
unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country rates.           

Gains and losses from sales of investments are calculated on the "identified  
cost" method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes. It   
is the practice of the Fund to first select for sale those securities which     
have the highest cost and also qualify for long- term capital gain or loss      
treatment for tax purposes. In addition, net realized capital gains on          
securities in certain countries give rise to capital gains taxes. The Fund      
paid $171,503 in capital gains taxes on gains realized on the sale of certain   
foreign securities during the year ended November 30, 1994.                     

B. Federal Taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of  
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to   
distribute all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any,    
to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provisions are            
required.                                                                       

The characterization of distributions to shareholders for financial           
reporting purposes is generally determined in accordance with income tax        
rules. Therefore, the source of a portfolio's distributions may be shown in     
the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess of net        
investment income or net realized gain on investment transactions, or from      
capital, depending on the type of book/tax differences that may exist.          

C. Trust Shares--The Fund records sales and repurchases of its trust shares   
on the trade date. Net losses, if any, as a result of cancellations are         
absorbed by Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc. (PFD), the principal underwriter    
for the Fund and a wholly owned subsidiary of The Pioneer Group, Inc. (PGI).    
PFD earned $324,413 in underwriting commissions on the sale of trust shares     
of the Fund during the year ended November 30, 1994. Dividends and              
distributions to shareholders are recorded as of the ex-dividend date.          
Dividends paid by the Fund, if any, with respect to each class of shares are    
calculated in the same manner, at the same time and on the same day and are     
in the same amount, except that Class A and Class B shares can bear different   
transfer agent and distribution fees. As of November 30, 1994, no dividends     
had been paid to the Class B shareholders.                                      

D. Foreign Currency Translation--The books and records of the Fund are        
maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are       
translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:                            

P-->485BPOS66th�Page�of�76TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�66th
(i) investment securities, other assets and liabilities initially               
expressed in foreign currencies--converted each business day into U.S.          
dollars based upon current exchange rates;                                      

(ii) purchases and sales of foreign securities, income and                  
expenses--converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency exchange rates        
prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions; and                    

(iii) foreign currencies held--converted at the rate of exchange of such      
currencies against U.S. dollars.                                                

Upon the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency,    
the Fund may enter into forward currency contracts for the purchase or sale,    
for a fixed amount of U.S. dollars, of the amount of foreign currency           
involved in the underlying security transaction.                                

Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency related           
transactions other than forward foreign currency hedge contracts generally      
represents: (1) foreign exchange gains and losses from the sale and holdings    
of foreign currencies, (2) gain and losses between trade date and settlement    
date on investment securities transactions and forward foreign currency         
settlement contracts related to these transactions, (3) gains and losses from   
the difference between amounts of interest and dividends recorded and the       
amount actually received.                                                       

At November 30, 1994, the unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency       
related transactions other than forward foreign currency hedge contracts        
were:

E. Forward Foreign Currency Hedge Contracts--The Fund is authorized to enter  
into forward foreign currency hedge contracts (contracts) for the purchase of   
a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date as a hedge or     
cross-hedge against either specific investment transactions or portfolio        
positions. All commitments are "marked-to-market" daily at the applicable       
translation rates, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded    
in the Fund's financial statements. The Fund records realized gains or losses   
at the time the contract is offset by entry into a closing transaction or       
extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering into    
these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the      
terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of       
foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar (See Note 7).                      

F. Class Allocations--Distribution expenses are calculated based on the       
average daily net asset value attributable to Class A and Class B shares of     
the Fund, respectively. Shareholders of Class A and Class B share all           
expenses and fees paid to the transfer service organization, Pioneering         
Services Corporation (PSC), for their services, which are allocated based on    
the number of accounts in each class and the ratable allocation of related      
out of pocket expenses (See Note 5). Income, common expenses and realized and   
unrealized gains (losses) are calculated at the fund level and allocated        
daily to each class of share based on the respective percentage of adjusted     
net assets at the beginning of the day.                                         

G. Reclassifications--Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1993    
balances to conform with the 1994 presentation.                                 

2. At November 30, 1994, the total cost of securities for federal income tax    
purposes was $249,102,037. The difference from total cost on a financial        
reporting basis results from wash sale losses, which are not recognized for     
federal income tax purposes. Aggregate gross unrealized gain on securities in   
which there was an excess of market value over tax cost was $7,441,196.         
Aggregate gross unrealized loss on securities in which there was an excess of   
tax cost over market value was $17,443,092. Net unrealized loss for tax         
purposes was $10,001,898.                                                       

For the year ended November 30, 1994, net realized gain on a financial          
reporting basis and on a tax basis was $12,500,948 and $19,107,674,             
respectively. The difference in net realized gain results from realized         
losses on forward

foreign currency exchange contracts (contracts) included in net capital gain    
on a financial reporting basis, but considered ordinary income on a tax basis   
and the realization of wash sale losses previously not recognized for federal   
income tax purposes net of wash sale losses incurred during the year. At        
November 30, 1994, undistributed net realized gain on investments on a          
financial reporting basis and on a tax basis amounted to $13,336,189 and        
$15,448,371, respectively. The difference in undistributed net realized gains   
on investments and contracts results from realized contract loss recognized     
as ordinary income for tax purposes, the realization of wash sale losses net    
of wash sale losses previously not recognized for federal income tax            
purposes, and the reclassification of tax operating losses to realized net      
capital gains.                                                                  

During the year ended November 30, 1994, net investment income on a financial   
reporting basis was $1,881,843 net investment loss on a tax basis was           
$3,228,343, respectively. The difference in net investment loss results         
primarily from realized contract losses and certain unrealized contract gains   
considered ordinary income for tax purposes, respectively. At November 30,
1994, undistributed net investment loss on a financial reporting and tax        
basis amounts to $0.                                                            

3. During the year ended November 30,1994, the cost of purchases and the        
proceeds from sales of investments, other than temporary cash investments,      
were $701,460,923 and $548,159,796, respectively.                               

4. Pioneering Management Corporation (PMC) is the Funds' investment adviser     
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGI. Management fees earned by PMC are         
calculated daily at the annual rate of 1.00% of the Fund's average daily net    
assets up to $300,000,000, 0.85% of the next $200,000,000 and 0.75% of such     
assets in excess of $500,000,000.                                               

PMC furnishes investment advice, provides facilities and office equipment,      
and pays executive salaries and certain other operating expenses under the      
management agreement. No officer of the Fund receives any compensation          
directly from the Fund. All officers of the Fund are directors and/or           
officers of the investment adviser and/or principal underwriter. In addition,   
certain other services and costs, including accounting, regulatory reporting    
and insurance premiums, are paid by the Fund under the management agreement.    
These expenses are reviewed annually by the Fund's Board of Trustees and        
billed to the Fund monthly by PMC based upon the actual costs incurred in       
providing these services. Included in Accrued expenses--Other is $14,034 in     
accounting fees due to PMC at November 30, 1994.                                

5. PSC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGI, provides substantially all transfer   
agent and shareholder services to the Fund, at negotiated rates. Included in    
Accrued expenses--Other is $65,102 in transfer fees payable to PSC at           
November 30, 1994.                                                              

6. The Fund has adopted a Plan of Distribution for both Class A shares          
("Class A Plan") and Class B shares ("Class B Plan") in accordance with Rule    
12B-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 pursuant to which certain        
distribution fees are paid to PFD.                                              

Pursuant to the Class A Plan, the Fund may reimburse PFD for its actual         
expenditures to finance any activity primarily intended to result in the sale   
of Class A shares or to provide services to holders of Class A shares.          
Reimbursement for such expenditures, if any, may not exceed 0.25% of the        
Fund's average annual net assets attributable to Class A shares. The Class B    
Plan provides that the Fund may pay a distribution fee at an annual rate of     
0.75% of the Funds average annual net assets attributable to Class B shares     
and may pay PFD a service fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of the Fund's         
average daily net assets attributable to Class B shares. Included in Accrued    
expenses--Other is $140,228 in distribution fees payable to PFD at November
30, 1994.                                                                       

Class B shares which are redeemed within six years of purchase are subject to   
a contingent deferred sales charge ("CDSC") at declining rates beginning at     
4.0% of the lesser of the current market value at the time of redemption or     
the original purchase cost of the shares being redeemed. Proceeds from the      
CDSC are paid to PFD. As of November 30, 1994, CDSC fees in the amount of       
$17,103 were paid to PFD.                                                       

7. At November 30, 1994, the Fund had entered into various forward foreign      
exchange hedge contracts (contracts) which contractually obligate the Fund to   
deliver currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract,    
the Fund may either sell portfolio securities or make delivery of the           
currency held. Alternatively, prior to the maturity of a contract, the Fund     
may close out a contract by entering into an offsetting contract.

Included in accumulated undistributed net realized gains/losses on              
investments, forward foreign currency hedge contracts and other foreign         
currency related transactions is $214,293 which represents the realized gain    
on contracts totaling $15,742,593 which have been closed with offsetting        
contracts.                                                                      

8. Effective December 1, 1993, the Fund has adopted the provisions of           
Statement of Position 93-2 (SOP 93-2) "Determination, Disclosure, and           
Financial Statement Presentation of Income, Capital Gain, And Return of         
Capital Distributions by Investment Companies". SOP 93-2 requires the Fund to   
report the accumulated net investment income and accumulated net realized       
capital gain (loss) accounts to approximate amounts available for future        
distributions on a tax basis (or to offset future realized capital gains). As   
a result, at December 1, 1993 the Fund has reclassified ($278,057) from         
accumulated undistributed net realized gains on investments, forward foreign    
currency hedge contracts and other foreign currency related transactions to     
accumulated net investment loss. In addition, at November 30, 1994 the Fund     
has reclassified $1,352,610 from accumulated undistributed net investment       
income to accumulated undistributed net realized gain on investments, forward   
foreign currency hedge contracts and other foreign currency related             
transactions. These reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value     
of the Fund and are intended to present the Fund's capital accounts on a tax    
basis.

Item 26.      Number of Holders of Securities                                   

              The following  table sets forth the  approximate  number of record
holders of each class of securities of the Registrant as of February 28, 1995:  

                Class A                Class B

Number of Record Holders:        30,756                  3,111                  
------------------------                                                        

Item 27.      Indemnification.                                                  

              Except  for the  Declaration  of Trust  dated  October  26,  1992,
establishing  the  Registrant as a Trust under  Massachusetts  law,  there is no
contract,  arrangement or statute under which any director, officer, underwriter
or affiliated  person of the Registrant is insured or  indemnified.  The Amended
and Restated  Declaration  of Trust  provides that no Trustee or officer will be
indemnified  against any liability to which the  Registrant  would  otherwise be
subject by reason of or for willful misfeasance,  bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of such person's duties.                                     

              Insofar  as  indemnification   for  liability  arising  under  the
Securities  Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"),  may be available to directors,
officers and  controlling  persons of the  Registrant  pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of
the Securities and Exchange  Commission such  indemnification  is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and is,  therefore,  unenforceable.  In the event
that a claim  for  indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than the
payment of the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling  person of the Registrant in the  successful  defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,  officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered,  the Registrant will, unless
in the  opinion  of its  counsel  the matter  has been  settled  by  controlling
precedent,  submit to a court of appropriate  jurisdiction  the question whether
such  indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

The fund’s investment
adviser has contractually agreed to limit ordinary operating expenses (ordinary operating expenses means all fund expenses other than extraordinary expenses, such as litigation, taxes, brokerage commissions and acquired fund fees and expenses) to
the extent required to reduce fund expenses to 1.45%, 2.35% and 2.35% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class A, Class B and Class C shares, respectively. These expense limitations are in effect through April 1, 2015. There can be no
assurance that the adviser will extend the expense limitations beyond such time. Net expenses for a Class may exceed the applicable expense limitation to the extent that the fund incurs excluded expenses. While in effect, the arrangement may be
terminated for a class only by agreement of the adviser and the Board of Trustees.

Example
This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods shown and then, except as indicated, redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. It also assumes that (a)
your investment has a 5% return each year and (b) the fund's total annual operating expenses remain the same except for year one (which considers the effect of the expense limitation). Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on
these assumptions your costs would be:

   Portfolio turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells
securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 101% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal investment strategies
Normally, the fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in equity
securities of non-U.S. issuers. These issuers may be located in both developed and emerging markets. Under normal circumstances, the fund's assets will be invested in securities of companies domiciled in at least three different foreign countries.
Generally, the fund's investments in any country are limited to 25% or less of its total assets. However, from time to time, the fund may invest more than 25% of its assets in issuers organized in Japan or the United Kingdom or in securities quoted
or denominated in the Japanese yen, the British pound and the euro.  
3  
 

Summary Prospectus 
 The fund may invest
without limitation in securities of issuers located in countries with emerging economies or securities markets, but will not invest more than 25% of its total assets in securities of issuers located in any one such country. Emerging economies or
securities markets generally will include, but not be limited to, countries included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging & Frontier Markets Index.
For purposes of the fund's investment policies, equity
securities include common stocks and other equity instruments, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest primarily in equity securities, depositary receipts, equity interests in real estate investment trusts (REITs), warrants, rights and
preferred shares. The fund may invest in initial public offerings of equity securities. The fund may also purchase and sell forward foreign currency exchange contracts in non-U.S. currencies in connection with its investments, including as a means
of managing relative currency exposure. The fund may
invest up to 20% of its total assets in debt securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. The fund may invest up to 5% of its net assets in below investment grade debt securities (known as “junk bonds”), including below investment grade
convertible debt securities and securities of issuers that are in default.
The fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives. The
fund may use derivatives, including forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for a variety of purposes, including; in an attempt to hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities, interest rates or currency exchange rates; as a
substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt to increase the fund’s return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. The fund may choose not to make use of derivatives
for a variety of reasons, and any use may be limited by applicable law and regulations. The fund also may hold cash or other short-term instruments.
The fund's investment adviser uses a value approach to select
the fund's investments. The adviser seeks to identify securities that are selling at reasonable prices or substantial discounts to their underlying values. The adviser evaluates a security's potential value, including the attractiveness of its
market valuation, based on the company's assets and prospects for earnings and revenue growth, employing a bottom-up analytical style. In making that assessment, the adviser employs fundamental research and 
 4 
  
 an
evaluation of the issuer based on its financial statements and operations. The adviser focuses on the quality and price of individual issuers and securities.
The adviser generally sells a portfolio security when it
believes that the security’s market value reflects its intrinsic value. The adviser makes that determination based upon the same criteria it uses to select portfolio securities.
Principal risks of investing in the fund
You could lose money on your investment in the fund. As with any mutual fund,
there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its objective.
Market risk. The values of
securities held by the fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or perceived adverse economic, political, or regulatory conditions, inflation, changes in interest or currency rates,
lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse investor sentiment. Adverse market conditions may be prolonged and may not have the same impact on all types of securities. The values of securities may fall due to factors affecting a particular
issuer, industry or the securities market as a whole. The stock market may perform poorly relative to other investments (this risk may be greater in the short term). High public debt in the U.S. and other countries creates ongoing and systemic
market risks and policymaking uncertainty. The financial crisis that began in 2008 has caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities worldwide. Governmental and non-governmental issuers have defaulted on, or been forced
to restructure, their debts, and many other issuers have faced difficulties obtaining credit. These market conditions may continue, worsen or spread, including in the U.S., Europe and beyond. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and
others of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In response to the crisis, the U.S. and other governments and the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks
have taken steps to support financial markets, including by keeping interest rates at historically low levels. More recently, the Federal Reserve has reduced its market support activities. Further reduction or withdrawal of this support, failure of
efforts in response to the crisis, or investor perception that these efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally as well as increase market volatility and reduce the value and liquidity of certain securities.
Whether or not the fund invests in securities of issuers located  
5  
 

Summary Prospectus 
 in or with significant exposure to
countries experiencing economic and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the fund’s investments may be negatively affected. In addition, policy and legislative changes in the U.S. and in other countries are affecting many aspects
of financial regulation. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time. The fund may experience a substantial or complete loss on any individual security or
derivative position. Risks of non-U.S. investments. Investing in non-U.S. issuers, or in U.S. issuers that have significant exposure to foreign markets, may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers. These risks are more pronounced for
issuers in emerging markets or to the extent that the fund invests significantly in one region or country. These risks may include different financial reporting practices and regulatory standards, less liquid trading markets, extreme price
volatility, currency risks, changes in economic, political, regulatory and social conditions, sustained economic downturns, financial instability, tax burdens, and investment and repatriation restrictions. Lack of information and less market
regulation also may affect the value of these securities. Withholding and other non-U.S. taxes may decrease the fund’s return. Non-U.S. issuers may be located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters.
Investing in depositary receipts is subject to many of the same risks as investing directly in non-U.S. issuers. Depositary receipts may involve higher expenses and may trade at a discount (or premium) to the underlying security.
Geographic focus risk. To the
extent that the fund invests from time to time more than 25% of its assets in issuers organized or located in a particular geographic region, including but not limited to issuers organized or located in Japan or the United Kingdom or in securities
quoted or denominated in the Japanese yen, the British pound and the euro, the fund may be particularly affected by adverse securities markets, exchange rates and social, political, regulatory or economic events which may occur in those countries or
regions. Currency risk. Because the fund may invest in non-U.S. currencies, securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies, and other currency-related investments, the fund is subject to currency risk, meaning that the fund could experience
losses based on changes in the exchange rate between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar or as a result of currency  
6  
 

conversion costs. Currency exchange rates can be volatile, and are affected
by factors such as general economic conditions, the actions of the U.S. and foreign governments or central banks, the imposition of currency controls and speculation.
Forward foreign currency transactions risk. To the extent that the fund enters into forward foreign currency transactions, it may not fully benefit from or may lose money on the transactions if changes in currency rates do not occur as anticipated or do not
correspond accurately to changes in the value of the fund's holdings, or if the counterparty defaults. Such transactions may also prevent the fund from realizing profits on favorable movements in exchange rates. Risk of counterparty default is
greater for counterparties located in emerging markets. The fund's ability to use forward foreign currency transactions successfully depends on a number of factors, including the forward foreign currency transactions being available at prices that
are not too costly, the availability of liquid markets, and the adviser’s judgment regarding the direction of changes in currency exchange rates.
Value style risk. The prices
of securities the adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as expected or may go down. Value stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the overall equity market.
Portfolio selection risk. The
adviser's judgment about a particular security or issuer, or about the economy or a particular sector, region or market segment, or about an investment strategy, may prove to be incorrect.
Small and mid-size companies risk. Compared to large companies, small- and mid-size companies, and the market for their equity securities, may be more sensitive to changes in earnings results and investor expectations, have more limited product lines and
capital resources, experience sharper swings in market values, have limited liquidity, be harder to value or to sell at the times and prices the adviser thinks appropriate, and offer greater potential for gain and loss.
Risks of investments in REITs.
Investments in real estate securities are affected by economic conditions, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. In addition, investing in REITs involves unique risks. They are significantly affected by the market for real estate
and are dependent upon management skills and cash flow. REITs may have lower trading volumes  
7  
 

Summary Prospectus 
 and may be subject to more abrupt
or erratic price movements than the overall securities markets. Mortgage REITs are particularly subject to interest rate and credit risks. In addition to its own expenses, the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and
other expenses paid by REITs in which it invests. Many real estate companies, including REITs, utilize leverage.
Risks of warrants and rights.
If the price of the underlying stock does not rise above the exercise price before the warrant expires, the warrant generally expires without any value and the fund loses any amount it paid for the warrant. The failure to exercise subscription
rights to purchase common shares would result in the dilution of the fund’s interest in the issuing company.
Preferred stocks risk.
Preferred stocks may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred stocks are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. In addition, a company’s preferred stocks generally pay dividends only
after the company makes required payments to holders of its bonds and other debt. Thus, the value of preferred stocks will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial
condition or prospects. The market value of preferred stocks generally decreases when interest rates rise. Preferred stocks of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred stocks of larger companies.
Risks of convertible securities. The market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. A downturn in equity markets may cause the price of convertible securities
to decrease relative to other fixed income securities.
Debt securities risk. Factors
that could contribute to a decline in the market value of debt securities in the fund include rising interest rates, if the issuer or other obligor of a security held by the fund fails to pay principal and/or interest, otherwise defaults or has its
credit rating downgraded or is perceived to be less creditworthy or the credit quality or value of any underlying assets declines. Junk bonds involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility and are less liquid, especially
during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher quality debt  
8  
 

securities; they may also be more difficult to value. Junk bonds have a
higher risk of default or are already in default and are considered speculative.
Market segment risk. To the
extent the fund emphasizes, from time to time, investments in a market segment, the fund will be subject to a greater degree to the risks particular to that segment, and may experience greater market fluctuation than a fund without the same
focus. Derivatives risk. Using stock index futures and options and other derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when market prices, interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not
anticipated by the fund. Using derivatives may increase the volatility of the fund's net asset value and may not provide the result intended. Derivatives may have a leveraging effect on the fund. Some derivatives have the potential for unlimited
loss, regardless of the size of the fund’s initial investment. Changes in a derivative’s value may not correlate well with the referenced asset or metric. The fund also may have to sell assets at inopportune times to satisfy its
obligations. Derivatives may be difficult to sell, unwind or value, and the counterparty may default on its obligations to the fund. New regulations are changing the derivatives markets. The regulations may make using derivatives more costly, may
limit their availability, or may otherwise adversely affect their value or performance. For derivatives that are required to be traded through a clearinghouse or exchange, the fund also will be exposed to the credit risk of the clearinghouse and the
broker that submits trades for the fund. It is possible that certain derivatives that are required to be cleared, such as certain swap contracts, will not be accepted for clearing. In addition, regulated trading facilities for swap contracts are
relatively new; they may not function as intended, which could impair the ability to enter into swap contracts. The extent and impact of the new regulations are not yet fully known and may not be for some time.
Risks of initial public offerings. Companies involved in initial public offerings (IPOs) generally have limited operating histories, and prospects for future profitability are uncertain. Information about the companies may be available for very limited
periods. The market for IPO issuers has been volatile, and share prices of newly public companies have fluctuated significantly over short periods of time. Further, stocks of newly-public  
9  
 

Summary Prospectus 
 companies may decline shortly after
the IPO. There is no assurance that the fund will have access to IPOs. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs.
Portfolio turnover risk. If
the fund does a lot of trading, it may incur additional operating expenses, which would reduce performance. A higher level of portfolio turnover may also cause shareholders to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains.
Leveraging risk. The value of
your investment may be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments, such as ETFs, that have embedded leverage. Leverage generally magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease
in the value of the fund's underlying assets or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have, potentially resulting in the loss of all assets. Engaging in such transactions may cause the fund to
liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements.
Risks of investment in other funds. Investing in other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), subjects the fund to the risks of investing in the underlying securities or assets held by those funds. When investing in another fund,
the fund will bear a pro rata portion of the underlying fund’s expenses, in addition to its own expenses.
Expense risk. Your actual
costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “Annual fund operating expenses” for a variety of reasons. For example, expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease. Net assets are
more likely to decrease and fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile.
Please note that there are many other factors that could
adversely affect your investment and that could prevent the fund from achieving its goals.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
The fund's past performance
The bar chart and table indicate the risks and volatility of an investment in
the fund by showing how the fund has performed in the past. The bar chart shows changes in the performance of the fund's Class A shares from calendar year to calendar year. The table shows the average annual total

† 
The performance of Class C
shares does not reflect the 1% front-end sales charge in effect prior to February 1, 2004. If you paid a 1% sales charge, your returns would be lower than those shown above. 

* 
Index values are calculated
using net returns. Net returns approximate the minimum possible dividend reinvestment—the dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax, applying the highest rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not
benefit from double taxation treaties. 

** 
Index
comparison begins on March 31, 1993  
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to
investors who hold fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.
After-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares. After-tax
returns for Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will vary.

Purchase and sale of fund shares
You may purchase, exchange or sell (redeem) shares each day the New York
Stock Exchange is open through your financial intermediary or, for accounts held directly with the fund, by contacting the fund’s transfer agent in writing or by telephone (Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc., P.O. Box
55014, Boston, MA 02205-5014, tel. 1-800-225-6292). Your
initial investment for Class A or Class C shares must be at least $1,000. Additional investments must be at least $100 for Class A shares and $500 for Class C shares. The initial investment for Class Y shares must be at least $5 million. This amount
may be invested in one or more of the Pioneer mutual funds that currently offer Class Y shares. There is no minimum additional investment amount for Class Y shares. Effective December 31, 2009, Class B shares are no longer offered to new or existing
shareholders, except for reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains distributions and exchanges for Class B shares of other Pioneer funds.
Tax information
The fund intends to make distributions that may be taxed as ordinary income,
qualified dividend income, or capital gains. Payments to
broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries If you purchase the
fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments create a conflict of interest by influencing
the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson or investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or investment professional or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more
information. 2

Dear Shareowner,                                                                

Pioneer International Growth Fund completed the first half of its fourth        
fiscal year on May 31, 1996. It was a much-improved climate for international   
investors, particularly for those in emerging markets. While some of the more   
established regions, namely Japan and the United Kingdom, remained stagnant,    
overall results were good.                                                      

How Your Fund Performed   

For the six months ended May 31, 1996, Pioneer International Growth Fund        
posted the following results:                                                   

(bullet) Class A shares -- Net asset value was $24.25 per share on May 31,      
 versus $21.21 six months earlier. The Fund produced a six-month
     total return of 14.33% based on net asset value, and 7.78% based on
maximum public offering price.                                

(bullet) Class B shares -- Net asset value stood at $23.85 per share on May     
      31, versus $20.94 six months earlier. Your Fund produced a six-month
   total return of 13.90% if shares were held throughout the period,
9.90% if shares were redeemed and the maximum 4.0% contingent 
deferred sales charge deducted on May 31.                     

Pioneer International Growth Fund introduced Class C shares to investors on     
January 31, 1996. Since then, they achieved the following results:              

(bullet) Net asset value was $23.78 per share on May 31, versus the opening     
net asset value of $22.46. Your Fund's total return for the   
    abbreviated period was 5.88% assuming shares were held throughout,
    4.88% assuming shares were redeemed and the 1% contingent deferred
sales charge deducted on May 31.                              

By comparison, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Europe,          
Australia, Far East (EAFE) Index, an unmanaged measure of international stock   
markets, returned 8.12% for the six months. Pioneer International Growth Fund   
Class A shares total return of 14.33% at net asset value outpaced the Index     
for the same period. The accompanying chart shows the Fund's total returns      
for longer time periods.

Pioneer's Approach to International Growth Opportunities  

Pioneer International Growth Fund pursues well-valued companies in              
established and emerging markets outside the United States. We focus on         
attributes such as company operations, cash flows and management. We also       
evaluate economic and government conditions that could affect companies and     
their long-term growth prospects. Our opportunistic approach helps keep the     
portfolio well diversified, offering a mix of established and developing        
markets. We remain confident that by identifying promising individual           
companies and countries, we can achieve the best results for the Fund over      
the long term.                                                                  

*Reflects deduction of the maximum 5.75% sales charge at the beginning of     
the period and assumes reinvestment of all distributions at net asset       
value.                                                                      

**Reflects deduction of the maximum applicable contingent deferred sales        
charge (CDSC) at the end of the period and assumes reinvestment of all      
distributions. The maximum CDSC is 4.0% and declines over six years.        

Past  performance  does not  guarantee  future  results.  Return and share price
fluctuate,  and your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their
original cost.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Just as your management considers where opportunities exist, we also keep in    
mind investing risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and          
political instabilities. For example, your management selectively uses          
conservative hedging techniques. As of May 31, 28% of the portfolio's           
currency exposure was offset by hedges. Mostly, we hedged against a fall in     
the Japanese yen when we expected it would weaken versus the U.S. dollar,       
which it did as the period progressed.                                          

The hedges in place over the six months slightly enhanced the Fund's return.    
Of course, your management does not view hedging as a strategy for augmenting   
the Fund's results; we believe hedges should be used for defensive purposes     
only. Instead, we try to achieve strong performance by researching individual   
companies and countries. That's one reason why we tend to choose companies      
with a healthy export business; when the dollar is strong, these firms can      
price their export goods more competitively and profitably. In addition, we     
like countries that exhibit a low correlation to U.S. interest rates, such as   
Taiwan, Korea and Indonesia.                                                    

Emerging Markets on the Rebound   

As we've stated before, we believe developing markets offer some of the         
world's best long-term investment prospects. We saw this potential during the   
six-month period, particularly in 1996 and specifically in Southeast Asian      
countries such as Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia. In addition to         
generally low interest rates and inflation, each of these countries offers      
intriguing opportunities for investors. For example, the political              
uncertainty stemming from Korea's April elections started to subside late in    
the period. We think its stock market offers excellent value, especially        
since it lagged other emerging markets over the past year. The Fund's largest   
position is in Korea Mobile Telecommunication, a cellular phone company,        
which has increased in price impressively in 1996 and, in our view, still       
remains well valued. We also expect solid results from Korean banks, namely     
Commercial Bank of Korea and Korea First Bank. Taiwan is another region we      
think offers excellent potential, despite near-term political tensions. Your    
management likes Siliconware Precision Industries, an integrated-circuit        
packaging company. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, your management favors          
Thailand and Indonesia, where markets started to bounce back considerably in    
early 1996, thanks to renewed investor interest. India, part of the Asian       
subcontinent, has played an increasingly important role in your Fund. The       
Indian market continued to trade at low prices, while offering earnings         
estimated to grow at 20% in fiscal year 1997. After the national elections,     
political concerns should subside, which we think will help interest rates      
come down and foreign investment pick up. We continue to maintain a position    
in Hong Kong, an area that has not experienced the dramatic growth of India,    
but nonetheless performed solidly in the six months.

P-->N-30D4th�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
In Latin America, some modest economic improvements were visible,               
particularly in Argentina. Your Fund holds some good values there;              
specifically, we like Telecom Argentina. Nonetheless, problems did persist      
throughout most of the region. In Brazil, for example, budget and election      
difficulties continued to hold down markets. Your management kept minimal       
exposure to Latin America, since we see similar growth potential with less      
risk in emerging Asian markets.                                                 

Economic Growth Slowly Building in Europe   

The environment for investing in Europe was mixed. While low inflation and      
slow economic growth sent interest rates lower across much of the Continent,    
we believed many stocks were too expensive. As a result, we kept a fairly low   
weighting in many European markets. Notable exceptions were Italy, France and   
Sweden. Italy and France are trading below their historical price-to-book       
values, indicating some inexpensively priced prospects. In Italy we             
especially like Olivetti and Telecom Italia, an information services firm and   
telecommunications company, respectively. Chargeurs, France's diversified       
conglomerate, also continues to intrigue us, despite a temporary downturn       
stemming from concerns regarding government regulation of its associate         
British Sky Broadcasting. In Sweden, the market's low prospective               
price-to-earnings ratio, coupled with earnings per share growth of 40%,         
reflects its growth potential. Sweden also offers many world class,             
multinational companies in a variety of industries, such as the                 
telecommunications firm Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericcson.                        

Japan's Troubles Continued  

Japan as a whole continued to experience problems. Despite historically low     
interest rates, the country's financial markets did not appreciate to any       
major extent over the period. While the weaker yen did help some Japanese       
exporters, other troubles, namely the continued banking crisis, caused many     
investors to look elsewhere. The potential for higher interest rates also       
triggered concerns. Your Fund's investments in Japan stood at 13% at May 31.    
While we expect to limit exposure to Japan until we see better valuations,      
our research did turn up some good values. As mentioned, we chose companies     
that have proven to be strong exporters, such as Toyota, Canon, Sony,           
Nintendo and Hitachi.                                                           

Looking Ahead   

Emerging markets are already benefiting from attractive valuations and          
economic and governmental initiatives designed to enhance competitiveness.      
These markets should continue to offer opportunities, since inflation and       
interest rates generally remain under control and, in our view, many            
companies are still trading at extremely low price levels. Even developed       
markets, while not as strong as a group, offer select values with strong        
potential gains.                                                                

Recent results demonstrate the benefit of diversifying internationally -- and   
the need to remain invested. Clearly, short-term setbacks and volatility will   
continue, as they do in the United States. But rather than jump in and out of   
international markets, investors should take a longer-term outlook, since the   
underperformance of one market often is offset by strong performance in         
another and volatility has much less of an impact on an investment over         
longer time periods. International investing also demonstrates the benefits     
of professional management. By investing in Pioneer International Growth        
Fund, you have access to emerging and established countries that are            
difficult, if not impossible, for individuals to participate in on their own.   
We expect the Fund's assortment of developing and established companies and     
countries will offer long-term investors solid results.

Notes to Financial Statements--May 31, 1996                                     

1.  Pioneer International Growth Fund (the Fund) is a Massachusetts business    
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified,     
open-end management investment company. The investment objective of the Fund    
is to seek long-term growth of capital by investing in a portfolio consisting   
primarily of foreign equity securities and in Depository Receipts for such      
securities.                                                                     

The Board of Trustees (the Trustees) has authorized the issuance of three       
share classes of the Fund, designated as Class A, Class B and Class C shares.   
Class C shares were first publicly offered on January 31, 1996. The shares of   
Class A, Class B and Class C represent an interest in the same portfolio of     
investments of the Fund and have equal rights to voting, redemptions,           
dividends and liquidation, except that each class of shares can bear            
different transfer agent and distribution fees, and have exclusive voting       
rights with respect to the distribution plans that have been adopted by Class   
A, Class B and Class C shareholders, respectively.                              

The Fund's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with           
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the     
Fund to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the     
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent        
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the         
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.         
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary    
of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund, which     
are in conformity with those generally accepted in the investment company       
industry:                                                                       

A. Security Valuation--Security transactions are recorded on trade date.
Each day, securities are valued at the last sale price on the principal 
exchange where they are traded. Securities that have not traded on the  
 date of valuation, or securities for which sales prices are not generally
reported, are valued at the mean between the last bid and asked prices. 
Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are    
valued at their fair value as determined by, or under the direction of, 
the Trustees. Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed  
each day at various times prior to the close of the New York Stock      
Exchange. The values of such securities used in computing the net asset 
value of the Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Temporary   
cash investments are valued at amortized cost. Dividend income is       
recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain dividends from    
foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed are       
recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the dividends. Interest     
income is recorded on the accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign   
taxes withheld at the applicable country rates.                         

Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the          
"identified cost" method for both financial reporting and federal income
tax purposes. It is the Fund's practice to first select for sale those  
securities that have the highest cost and also qualify for long-term    
capital gain or loss treatment for tax purposes.                        

The Fund's investments in emerging markets or countries with limited or 
 developing markets may subject the Fund to greater degree of risk than in
a developed market. Risks associated with these developing markets,     
attributable to political, social or economic factors, may affect the   
price of the fund's investments and income generated by these           
investments, as well as the Fund's ability to repatriate such amounts.  

B. Foreign Currency Translation--The books and records of the Fund are  
 maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates.              

 Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
 among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between 
the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollar actually received.     
Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on   
investments are not segregated in the statement of operations from the  
effects of changes in market price of those securities but are included 
with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.       

16  

P-->N-30D18th�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
C. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts--The Fund enters into forward     
foreign currency contracts (contracts) for the purchase or sale of a    
 specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date as a hedge or
cross-hedge against either specific investment transactions (settlement 
hedges) or portfolio positions (portfolio hedges). All contracts are    
marked to market daily at the applicable exchange rates, and any        
 resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the Fund's financial
statements. The Fund records realized gains or losses at the time a     
portfolio hedge is offset by entry into a closing transaction or        
extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering 
into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to  
meet the terms of the contract and from unanticipated movements in the  
value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 6).   

D. Taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
 Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if 
any, to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is 
required.                                                               

In addition to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund  
may also be required to pay local taxes on net realized capital gains in
certain countries. The required capital gains taxes, if any, are        
determined in accordance with local tax laws. In determining daily net  
asset value, the Fund estimates the reserve for capital gains taxes, if 
any, associated with net unrealized gains on certain portfolio          
securities. The estimated reserve for capital gains taxes, if any, is   
based on the holding periods of such securities and the related tax     
rates, tax loss carryforwards (if applicable) and other such factors.   
Included in accrued expenses is $336,370 in reserve for capital gains   
 taxes at May 31, 1996. During the six months ended May 31, 1996, the Fund
paid no capital gains taxes on the sale of certain foreign securities.  

The characterization of distributions to shareholders for financial     
reporting purposes is determined in accordance with federal income tax  
rules. Therefore, the source of the Fund's distributions may be shown in
the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess of net
investment income or net realized gain on investment transactions, or   
from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax differences that
may exist.                                                              

E. Fund Shares--The Fund records sales and repurchases of its shares on 
the trade date. Net losses, if any, as a result of cancellations are    
absorbed by Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc. (PFD), the principal        
underwriter for the Fund and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of The 
Pioneer Group, Inc. (PGI). PFD earned $200,418 in underwriting          
commissions on the sale of fund shares during the six months ended May
31, 1996. Distributions to shareholders are recorded as of the          
 ex-dividend date. Distributions paid by the Fund, if any, with respect to
 each class of shares are calculated in the same manner, at the same time,
on the same day and in the same amount, except that Class A, Class B and
Class C shares bear different transfer agent and distribution fees.     

F. Class Allocations--Distribution fees are calculated based on the     
average daily net asset value attributable to Class A, Class B and Class
C shares of the Fund, respectively. Shareholders of each class share all
expenses and fees paid to the transfer agent, Pioneering Services       
Corporation (PSC), for their services, which are allocated based on the 
number of accounts in each class and the ratable allocation of related  
 out-of-pocket expenses (see Note 3). Income, common expenses and realized
and unrealized gains (losses) are calculated at the Fund level and      
allocated daily to each class of shares based on the respective         
percentage of adjusted net assets at the beginning of the day.          

G. Repurchase Agreements--The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements.
 At the time the Fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the value of the
underlying security (collateral), including accrued interest, will be   
 equal to or exceed the value of the repurchase agreement, and in the case
of repurchase agreements exceeding one day, the value of the underlying 
security, including accrued interest, is required during the term of the
 agreement to be equal to or exceed the value of the repurchase agreement.
The underlying securities for all repurchase agreements are held in     
safekeeping in the customer-only account of the Fund's custodian, or at 
the Federal Reserve Bank. If the seller defaults and the value of the   
collateral declines, or if bankruptcy proceedings commence with respect 
to the seller of the security, realization of the collateral by the Fund
may be delayed or limited.

2.  Pioneering Management Corporation (PMC), the Fund's investment adviser,     
manages the Fund's portfolio and is a wholly owned subsidiary of PGI.           
Management fees are calculated daily at the annual rate of 1.00% of the         
Fund's average daily net assets up to $300 million; 0.85% of the next $200      
million; and 0.75% of excess over $500 million.                                 

In addition, under the management agreement, certain other services and         
costs, including accounting, regulatory reporting and insurance premiums, are   
paid by the Fund. Included in due to affiliates is $33,928 and $23,235 in       
management fees and accounting fees, respectively, payable to PMC at May 31,
1996.                                                                           

3.  PSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PGI, provides substantially all           
transfer agent and shareholder services to the Fund at negotiated rates.        
Included in due to affiliates is $58,496 in transfer agent fees payable to      
PSC at May 31, 1996.                                                            

4.  The Fund adopted a Plan of Distribution for each class of shares (Class A   
Plan, Class B Plan and Class C Plan) in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the       
Investment Company Act of 1940. Pursuant to the Class A Plan, the Fund pays     
PFD a service fee of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets in      
reimbursement of its actual expenditures to finance activities primarily        
intended to result in the sale of Class A shares. Pursuant to the Class B       
Plan and Class C Plan, the Fund pays PFD 1.00% of the average daily net         
assets attributable to each class of shares. The fee consists of a 0.25%        
service fee and a 0.75% distribution fee paid as compensation for personal      
services and/or account maintenance services or distribution services with      
regard to Class B and Class C shares. Included in due to affiliates is          
$251,067 in distribution fees payable to PFD at May 31, 1996.                   

In addition, redemptions of each class of shares may be subject to a            
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). A CDSC of 1.00% may be imposed on      
certain net asset value purchases of Class A shares that are redeemed within    
one year of purchase. Class B shares that are redeemed within six years of      
purchase are subject to a CDSC at declining rates beginning at 4.0% based on    
the lower of cost or market value of shares being redeemed. Redemptions of      
Class C shares within one year of purchase are subject to a CDSC of 1.00%.      
Proceeds from the CDSC are paid to PFD. For the six months ended May 31,
1996, CDSCs in the amount of $40,572 were paid to PFD.                          

5.  The Fund has entered into certain expense offset arrangements resulting     
in the reduction of the Fund's total expenses. For the six months ended May
31, 1996, the Fund's expenses were reduced by $22,666 under such                
arrangements.                                                                   

6.  At May 31, 1996, the Fund had entered into various contracts that           
obligate the Fund to deliver currencies at specified future dates. At the       
maturity of a contract, the Fund must make delivery of the foreign currency.    
Alternatively, prior to the settlement date of a portfolio hedge, the Fund      
may close out such contracts by entering into an offsetting hedge contract.     
Open portfolio hedges at May 31, 1996 were as follows:

Included in accumulated net realized gain on investments and foreign currency   
transactions is $953,306, which represents the realized gain on closed but      
unsettled portfolio hedges totaling approximately $65,500,000.                  

At May 31, 1996, the gross forward foreign currency settlement contracts        
receivable and payable were $1,489,801 and $1,490,225, respectively,            
resulting in a net payable of $424.

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF PIONEER                        
INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND:                                                  

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Pioneer International     
Growth Fund, including the schedule of investments, as of May 31, 1996, and     
the related statement of operations, statements of changes in net assets and    
financial highlights for the periods presented. These financial statements      
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our   
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
financial highlights based on our audits.                                       

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing      
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and          
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of            
securities owned as of May 31, 1996, by correspondence with the custodian. An   
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant    
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis   
for our opinion.                                                                

 In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Pioneer International Growth Fund as of May 31, 1996, the results of its        
operations, the changes in its net assets and financial highlights for the      
periods presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting             
principles.
