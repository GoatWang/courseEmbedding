_The Coates Spherical Rotary Valve (CSRV) System


In the late 1960s and 1970s, most vehicles combustion engines in the USA   were running at a compression ratio of 12 to 1, which resulted in an   engine efficiency of approximately 35 percent. The rest of the engine   power was lost in friction, pumping and heat loss. When it was found   that lead additives in fuel had an adverse effect on the environment, it   was removed from the fuel. This caused the poppet valves and  combustion  chamber on poppet valve engines to overheat, raising the  temperature to  in excess of 2500 degrees F and damaging the poppet  valves.The  answer to this problem was to  lower the compression ratio of all engines  to 10 to 1 or lower, thus  reducing efficiency of the combustion engine  to approximately 24  percent. This means less miles per gallon (MPG),  lower brake horse  power (BHP) and lower torque. The air traveling in  through the inlet  venturi of a combustion engine inlet travels at a  speed of up to 450ft a  second. In normally aspirated engines this works  fine, but in poppet  valve engines, the BHP and torque decreased as the  air traveling in  does not increase in speed unless a turbo or  supercharger is  incorporated. At higher RPMs the poppet valve tends to  float or bounce  and is unable to service the cylinder and chamber to  capacity with air  and fuel mixture. This is the reason for adding two  extra valves to  modern engines, causing unburned fuel to escape through  the exhaust  system which leads to a loss of power, lower MPG and  produces  significant pollution.The poppet valves' stems  are  lubricated with engine oil which is burned off after a short  period of  running. The stem of the inlet valve system is also  lubricated with  engine oil, which is washed off and inducted into the  combustion chamber  with air and fuel mixture. This slows combustion and  produces further  emissions and eventually clogs the catalytic  converter.Variable  valve timing has  advantages at lower RPMs as it can shorten the overlap  duration of the  valves, but has extra moving parts that eventually wear.  On quick  deceleration, it can cause piston and valve contact where  serious  damage can occur. Poppet valves, if not activated with hydraulic   systems, must have clearance readjusted periodically. The successful   poppet valve of the original combustion engine has been used and   modified continuously until the present. However, it is the most   troublesome part of a combustion engine and has lower efficiency at   higher RPMs.

Introducing the CSRV EngineThe Coates Spherical Rotary Valve Engine  is the most advanced in the world, with the most positive valving system  ever built. The breathing capabilities of the system are almost double  that of a poppet valve. For instance: a static test of a five-litre  poppet valve engine on an airflow machine produced a reading of 133  cubic feet per minute (CFM) with valve fully opened. The five-litre  Coates Spherical Rotary Valve Engine on the same machine, however,  produced a reading of 319 CFMs fully opened; a colossal advantage in  airflow comparison. A five-litre poppet vavle engine tested on a  dynomometer under the same loads and conditions at 5500 produced 480 BHP  and 454 foot pounds of torque. The maximum RPMs on the poppet valve  engine were 5700 RPMs; the Spherical Rotary Valve Engine in comparison  reached 14,850 RPM's, The Coates Spherical Rotary Valve comprises two  spherical rotary valves assembled on two separate shafts - one for inlet  and one for exhaust. They rotate on ceramic carbon bearing with no oil  lubrication, the spheres do not make contact with any part of the  housing. The seals are a floating type and are also made of a ceramic  material. They have two piston rings and are floating in a small  cylinder-type chamber, they are activated by the compression and the  combustion strokes of the engine which allows 100 percent sealing  effectiveness, when compressed.Because the valves rotate away from the combustion chamber and are vented and charged on the opposite side of each sphere, this creates a lower combustion chamber temperature, allowing for higher compression ratios to be used thus creating an extremely efficient engine. Some of the Coates Spherical Rotary Combustion Engines are at 12 to 1, 13 to 1, 14 to 1 and 15 to 1 compression ratios depending on the application.

_CSRV System Advantages


The Coates Spherical Rotary Valve System (CSRV) replaces the traditional  Poppet Valves and all their associated parts, springs, guides, seats,  retainers, cotters, pushrods, cam followers, camshaft, camshaft  bearings, and many more parts including the oil.









Animation: CSRV vs Poppet Valve


 
The CSRV System is comprised of only two moving shafts and does not 
utilize oil pressure fed bearings, or oil spray; in fact, no engine oil 
is present in the head of the CSRV Engine.  This means the engine oil 
does not see the hottest parts of the engine, which was the exhaust 
Poppet Valves.  These extremely hot components usually are engine oil 
spray cooled.  This heat would breakdown the atomic structure of the 
engine oil, thus lowering the oil viscosity, therefore, oil changes are 
recommended every 3,000 to 5,000 miles.  On the other hand, with the CSRV  incorporated in the engine design, oil change intervals are 
extended to approximately 50,000 miles or more.
 



  The constant rotation of the CSRV, rotate away from the extreme heat of the combustion chamber, eliminating the possibility of hot spots in the combustion chamber; thus allowing for higher compression chamber ratios to be incorporated in the design of a combustion engine.  This results in a higher thermal efficient engine and a more complete combustion that will utilize all of the energy contained in the fuel; also reducing harmful emissions. High Compression Ratios In the 1950 and 1960s combustion engines utilized compression ratios of 12 to 1. and higher, producing higher horsepower (H.P.), more torque (TQ) and a higher (thermal efficient engine)   Engine efficiency was at approximately 35%.  Governments around the world found that tetraethyl lead was the lead component in the gasoline at that time.    The findings were that this lead component in the fuel was extremely hazardous to human health and the world’s environment; it was then removed from the fuel.  This caused the high compression automobile engines to develop hot spots in the combustion chamber and the hot spot was found to be the exhaust poppet valve.  It was getting red hot, causing pre-ignition and damage to the engines.  The only remedy for this was to lower the compression ratio of all engines; this resulted in a lowering of thermal efficiency from an engine having 35% efficiency to 22 to 24% efficiency.  This included the less dense fuel with the lead removed.  This means for every dollar worth of fuel you put into your vehicle, you only get 22 to 24 cents of drivability, and the other 76 to 78 cents are lost through heat friction and pumping losses.  We extract out of the earth approximately 86,000,000 barrels of oil daily, 62,000,000 barrels of this oil is lost just keeping our engines running.  The other 24,000,000 barrels make possible our actual driving motion, and at the same time, creating insurmountable amounts of other harmful pollutions to be pumped into our atmosphere.    These are the reasons that compelled founder, George Coates to develop the CSRV Combustion Engine.  The CSRV Engine utilizes much higher compression ratios, and has no hot spots and has a much greater volumetric efficiency; creating a higher thermal efficient combustion engine in the 35 – 40%, and possibly higher.  With the ability to utilize alternative fuels, these possibilities open up new opportunities to reduce the world’s consumption of oil-fossil fuels, and reduce the production of harmful emissions that are pumped out into our atmosphere every day, and if implemented will reduce the United States’ dependency on imported foreign oil.Rethinking the Internal Combustion Engine    The Coates Spherical Rotary Valve Engine is the most advanced in the world. A conventional piston engine ignites the fuel and air mixture in the combustion cycle and evacuates the gas by-products in the exhaust cycle. These cycles occur thousands of times per minute per cylinder. Through the rotation of the camshaft, a spring-loaded poppet valve opens to enable the fuel and air mixture to enter the firing chamber during the induction stroke. The camshaft then closes the intake valve during the compression and combustion stroke of the cylinder and opens a second spring-loaded valve to vent the cylinder after ignition. These gases then enter the exhaust manifold.  The parts required for this conventional spring-loaded valve assembly include items such as springs, cotters, guides, rockers, shafts and the valves themselves. The valve operates in a vertical position in the cylinder head such that a downward movement opens the valve and allows the introduction or evacuation of gas from the chamber.   The weakest link in the conventional engine has been the limited effectiveness of the poppet valve. The Coates engine replaces the poppet valve with a spherical rotary valve, thereby creating more efficient and powerful combustion and compression stokes.    The spherical rotary valve system is made up of spheres rotating on a shaft sandwiched between a split head. These spheres are either chain or belt driven via the crankshaft, much like an overhead camshaft. Each sphere rotates against a matching seal between it and the piston, one for intake and one for exhaust. The spheres have cavities and ports machined into them for the induction of fuel and air on the intake stroke, and the evacuation of fired gases on the exhaust stroke. This design performs exactly the same function as poppet valves, but the design eliminates the poppet valves, valve springs, guides, camshaft, pushrods, rocker arms and other smaller parts. The Coates engine operates with over 100 fewer parts than convention engines.    In addition, the spherical rotary valve combustion engine utilizes a proprietary seal at the intake and exhaust ports of the cylinder to prevent pressure leakage. This two-piece seal contacts the peripheral surface of the rotary valve and utilizes the compression and expansion of the fuel and air mixture to create a gas-tight seal with the valves. The lubrication of the rotary valve assembly is accomplished by bronze shaft bearings. CSRV AdvantagesThe spherical rotary valve combustion engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional poppet valve assembly. The benefits include the following:  Lower Emissions: Conventional engines run hot due to their inability to disperse heat from the firing chamber. The resulting high temperatures break down the oil used to lubricate the valves and produce oxides of nitrogen as well as the usual hydrocarbons. In addition, oil entering the combustion chamber through the intake valve is continually redirected back into the induction system due to pressure provided by the exhaust valve. This process compounds the problem of oil burning in a conventional engine.  The Coates engine avoids the problem of oil burning by requiring no oil lubricants for the valves. Moreover, the rotation of the spherical valve heads reduces engine temperature by constantly changing the surface exposed to combustion heat. By eliminating the use of oil in valve lubrication and lowering operating temperature, the Coates engine emits significantly lower levels of pollutants than a conventional engine.    Reduced Fuel Requirements - Conventional engines lose power through friction and pumping. The spherical rotary valve assembly virtually eliminates engine friction and pumping losses. As a result of this operating efficiency, engines incorporating the spherical rotary valve design offer higher fuel economy than do conventional engines.  Reduced Lubrication Requirements - The use of seals and shaft bearing make oil lubrication of the valve heads unnecessary and lower the overall oil requirements of the Coates engine in comparison to a conventional engine. Without the component wear that characterizes typical poppet valve systems, engines using the spherical rotary valve design also produce fewer metallic particulates. As a result of these factors, the spherical rotary valve engine can realize longer maintenance intervals than conventional engines.    Increased Engine Power - The comparative efficiencies of the spherical rotary valve combustion engine have enabled engine speeds of 14,850 RPMs. In addition, the spherical rotary valve design can accommodate markedly higher compression ratios than conventional engines. The rotary design provides these exceptionally higher compression ratios with no detectable detonation when utilizing fuels of lower octane ratings. These factors, coupled with the ability of the rotary valve head to deliver more fuel to the combustion chamber than the poppet valve, makes the Coates design especially well suited for more powerful engines.    Reduced Engine Noise and Vibration - The spherical rotary valve combustion engine virtually eliminates mechanical clatter, one of the sources of engine noise. Mechanical clatter is a by-product of the wearing of components, inadequate lubrication, and components working themselves out of adjustment. The operation of CIL's prototype engines involves a rotary movement of the valve with uniform acceleration and deceleration of the components.  Without the specific stresses and vibrations inherent in a poppet valve assembly, the spherical rotary valve combustion engine runs more quietly than conventional engines.    Alternative Fuel Adaptability - Unlike engines of conventional design, the spherical rotary valve assembly can be fit to almost any internal combustion engine from the single cylinder to the largest marine diesel. In addition, the spherical rotary valve system causes the engine to run far cooler than conventional designs thereby enabling it to utilize lower octane fuels. Conventional poppet valves run hot due to their inability to disperse heat away from the combustion chamber. Hot exhaust valves in the conventional valve train system create "hot spots" which are the primary cause of pre-ignotion unless lead additives are present. Lead-free gasoline requires the use of long-stroke, relatively low compression engines in order to function properly without fuel additives. High compression ratios can be utilized incorporating the Coates more efficient and powerful short-stroke design, while maintaining the desirable characteristics of optimum performance using lead-free gasoline. The design also allows the use of alternate fuels such as methanol and an alcohol mixture. The capability of variable valve timing is a design characteristic that lends itself to alternate fuel compatibility.    Reduced Manufacturing Costs - Utilizing standard production techniques while remaining within acceptable engineering standards and tolerances relating to current production line technology, the design can be manufactured at a substantial savings due to the following factors: (a) Reduction in the number of engine components(the number of components required in the manufacture of the design is approximately 29 vs. 155+ for conventional valve train designs); and (b) All components of the design can be die cast or stamped out resulting in a dramatic reduction of assembly time over conventional engine designs and once assembled, requires no further adjustments.  Comparative Analysis    Emissions tests conducted by an independent EPA-Compliant laboratory in USA have confirmed the superiority of Coates International CSRV engines in producing significantly lower pollutant. The following chart presents the emission results as reported by an independent laboratory which tested two vehicles, one running with stock engine and the second with stock engine retrofitted with Coates CSRV system.  Both vehicles were tested in steady state with the following parameters:    No EGR systemWarm up run on Dynamometer: 30 minutesEngine temperature: 180 degrees FInertia Load: 2,000 poundsRoad horsepower: 13Two catalytic converters installed

Each vehicle was tested under various RPM and MPH scenarios and the  above data represent the best results from the multiple test runs. Engine DynamicsThe average poppet valve opens a maximum of  approximately 8 millimeters, restricting air flow. In addition, valves  in high compression engines cannot open before top dead center. If they  do, they will make contact with the piston and engine destruction  occurs. The Coates Spherical Rotary Valve System can open before top  dead center and, in fact, can open at any desired point. This  flexibility in breathing ports far exceeds the four poppet valve per  cylinder combustion engine and allows the engine to run more  effectively.    Poppet valve engines almost always exceed a  temperature of 2,500 degrees F which in turn, at such high temperatures,  produce oxides of nitrogen which are visible as "smog" over cities such  as Los Angeles, etc. The inlet poppet valve stems induct oil through  the induction valve guides. On the exhaust stroke the poppet exhaust  valve stems allow "back" pressure through the valve guides into the  engine casing. This pressure is then redirected through the fuel  induction system and in turn is reburned in the engine creating yet more  hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.     Back  pressure and oil burning in combustion engines equipped with the Coates  valve system are substantially reduced, principally because the Coates  system requires no oil lubricants. The oil-free environment is possible  because the shaft bearings in the system are made of materials which  require no lubrication. The end result is a significant reduction in  hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emission pollutants.

Headquarters in New Jersey Yesterday, to Discuss Procurement and Installation of Coates CSRV Industrial Electric Power Generators at US Army Bases WALL TOWNSHIP, N.J., May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK:COTE) (the “Company”) on May 2, 2017, a meeting was held at the Coates International, Ltd. headquarters in New Jersey with two officials from the Pentagon ACSIM-ODF US Army to discuss the use of Coates CSRV industrial electric power generators operating on natural gas for deployment at US Army bases. Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “This was a very important meeting for the Company.  A number of Coates CSRV industrial natural gas electric power generator types were demonstrated, including a propane unit and various gasoline engines.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the parties agreed that it was productive and positive.  The representatives were presented with manuals, official test data and informative DVDs.  A transaction of this magnitude represents a significant opportunity for our Company. The requisite technology and know-how is already in place.  All products for this application will be manufactured in the USA. Company management is enthusiastic about the extent of this potential project to deploy our CSRV natural gas Gen Sets at US Army bases.  Our Gen Sets lower harmful emissions into the atmosphere, reduce costs and utilize fuel that is readily available in vast quantities through the United States, including “flare-off gas” which is normally wasted because it is not suitable for powering conventional internal combustion engines.”   04/19/2017- Coates International, Ltd. Received Official Notification From Secure Supplies Mexico LLC That the Solar System Project in Mexico is Budgeted for $412,000,000 USD Over a Three Year Period to Completion - Coates International, Ltd. is to Manufacture and Deliver a Number of Large Industrial CSRV Electric Power Generators That Will Operate on Hydrogen - on Site Revenues From This Transaction to the Company Will be Approximately $40,000,000 USD Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK:COTE) (the “Company”) recceived official notification from Secure Supplies Mexico LLC that the solar system project in Mexico is budgeted for $412,000,000 USD over a three year period.  The Company will deliver 40 to 50 CSRV large industrial electric power generators to operate on gaseous hydrogen produced on site. Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “This is only one of the projects that our Company is involved in with Secure Supplies.  These projects work in the following way:  Secure Supplies set out on the site where hundreds of solar panels are erected producing electric power and producing hydrogen, which is stored in special expansion tanks.  When the sun goes down, the Coates CSRV electric power generators fire up operating on the stored hydrogen, which is produced by the sun.  These CSRV generators are synchronous and only produce the power required at any given time up to 50 M.W.  These are the most “green” projects ever.  These projects are many worldwide.  Coates CSRV engines are the only engine suitable to operate on gaseous hydrogen continuously. “Management believes this is a turning point for the Company that will benefit all involved.”   02/28/2017-Coates International, Ltd. Has an Agreement in Place With Secure Supplies USA LLC and Secure Supplies Mexico LLC – Initial Orders Will be for a Project in New Jersey That Will Require 35, 1MW CSRV Hydrogen Powered Industrial Gen Sets and a Project in Mexico That Will Require 40, 1 MW CSRV Hydrogen Powered Industrial Gen Sets - Estimated Value of These Projects is $35,000,000 in New Jersey and $40,000,000 in Mexico for a Total Value to Coates of $75,000,000 WALL TOWNSHIP, N.J., Feb. 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK:COTE) (the “Company”) has previously entered into a sublicense agreement with Secure Supplies USA LLC and Secure Supplies Mexico LLC (together “Secure Supplies”).  In addition to a $1 million licensing fee to be paid upfront, the Company will also fulfill orders to manufacture and deliver 35 1MW CSRV Hydrogen Powered Industrial Electric Power Generator Sets (“Hydrogen Gen Sets”) for the project in New Jersey and 40 1MW CSRV Hydrogen Gen Sets for Mexico.  Secure Supplies has informed the Company that it anticipates receiving funding from its customers to enable it to remit payments to us for the sublicense fee and deposits for 50% of the order value to be paid with orders it intends to place, beginning in March 2017. Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  -  “An initial 1MW V12 Industrial engine from Cummins is already en route to the Coates facility in New Jersey for development of the Hydrogen Gen Sets for this larger engine specification; -  The Company has already built a 150 KW CSRV Gen Set for Secure Supplies to be used for demonstration and testing; -  The Company is in ongoing discussions with other potential new customers. We were disappointed to learn that a number of people directly contacted Secure Supplies after we disclosed the news of our new sublicense. This is inappropriate and interferes in our relationship with Secure Supplies. Our business partners are intensely focused on successfully carrying out their own business plans, which did not include responding to such multiple inquiries. Exercising discretion in this regard is of great importance for everyone. -  To date, we have not received the proposals from China for manufacturing operations that were previously promised to be submitted to us for review; -  Mr. Nick Kontonicolas has not been able to secure financing for production operations to date.  While this has been disappointing, we have never exclusively relied on this financing and are continuing to work on alternative sources of financing. Accordingly, the Company expects to be able to continue to pursue its business plans; -  The Company is planning expansion of its manufacturing capacity on readily available space on its own property in anticipation of the need to fulfill orders to be received from Secure Supplies.  -  We have received inquiries about the relatively small staff at the Coates plant.  Our research and development activities involve scientific, proprietary technology and we prefer to limit accessibility until development of the technology reaches a stage where it can be patented. This is also a component of our strategy to preserve our working capital. -  The Company continues to press ahead with its endeavors and business plans.”   11/30/2016-Ctes Intoaernational, Ltd. Lands a $400,000,000 USD Transaction With Secure Supplies Mexico LLC and Secure Supplies USA LLC to Exclusively License and Supply Coates CSRV "Green Technology" Electric Power Industrial Generator Sets Operating on Hydrogen Fuel, (Marketwired - Nov 30, 2016) - Coates International, Ltd. ( OTC PINK: COTE ) (the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has landed a transaction worth $400,000,000 USD with Secure Supplies Mexico LLC and Secure Supplies USA LLC. Coates CSRV green engine electric power industrial generator sets are to become a key component of their solar energy power stations in Mexico and the USA. The Gen Sets will operate on hydrogen produced by solar cells, which are already in place in numerous U.S. locations and which are being set up in Mexico and other locations. The first project for Coates is to supply CSRV Gen Sets that will produce 400 Megawatts of electrical power, which will generate revenues of $400,000,000 USD over a 2-3 year period.

 Coates International Ltd De	
Business Description








Coates International, Ltd. has been developing over a period of more than 20 
  years a patented Coates Spherical Rotary Valve® (“CSRV®”) 
  system technology which is adaptable for use in piston-driven internal combustion 
  engines of many types. Independent testing of various engines in which we incorporated 
  our CSRV® system technology (“CSRV® Engines”) confirmed 
  meaningful fuel savings when compared with internal combustion engines based 
  on the conventional “poppet valve” assembly prevalent in most internal 
  combustion engines throughout the world. In addition, our CSRV® Engines 
  produced only ultra-low levels of harmful emissions while in operation. Engines 
  operating on the CSRV® system technology can be powered by a wide selection 
  of fuels. We believe that these three major advantages of the CSRV® system 
  technology constitute the first revolutionary technological advancement of the 
  internal combustion engine suitable for large scale production since its introduction 
  more than one hundred years ago.
The CSRV® system is designed to replace the intake and exhaust conventional 
  “poppet valves” currently used in almost all piston-driven stationary, 
  automotive, motorcycle, and marine engines. Unlike conventional valves which 
  protrude into the engine combustion chamber, the Coates® rotary valve system 
  utilizes spherical valves that rotate in a cavity formed between a two-piece 
  cylinder head. The Coates rotary valve system uses approximately 1/10th the 
  moving parts of conventional poppet valve assemblies. As a result of these design 
  improvements, management believes that the engines incorporating the Coates 
  rotary valve system (Coates engines®) will last significantly longer and 
  will require less lubrication over the life of the engine, as compared to conventional 
  engines. In addition, Coates rotary valves can be designed with a larger opening 
  into the engine cylinder than conventional valves so that more fuel and air 
  can be inducted into and expelled from the cylinder in a shorter period of time. 
  Larger valve openings permit higher revolutions-per-minute (RPM’s) and 
  permit higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures, 
  allowing the Coates engine® to produce more power than equivalent conventional 
  engines. The CSRV® engine is a highly thermal-efficient power unit.

  We have been granted an exclusive license to this technology from our founder, 
  George J. Coates and his son, Gregory G. Coates (the “Coates License Agreement”), 
  in the Territory defined to include North America, Central America and South 
  America (the “Americas”).

  Since our inception, the bulk of our development costs and related operational 
  costs have been funded primarily through cash generated from the sales of our 
  common stock, issuances of promissory notes and convertible promissory notes, 
  capital contributions, sales of a small number of natural gas powered CSRV® 
  industrial electric power generator sets (“Gen Sets”), a gain on 
  the sale of the land and building that serves as our principal facility, from 
  the performance of contractual research and development activities involving 
  the CSRV® system technology and the receipt of licensing fees for our CSRV® 
  system technology.
We have completed development of the CSRV® system technology-based generator 
  engine and are prepared to commence the production phase of our operations, 
  provided we raise sufficient new working capital to first produce and field 
  test a number of additional engine generators. We intend to sell the engine 
  generators to Almont Energy, Inc., (“Almont”) for (i) a license 
  agreement covering the territory of Canada; and, (ii) certain rights to a license 
  covering the territory of the United States. Almont is a privately held, independent 
  third party entity based in Alberta, Calgary, Canada. We also intend to enter 
  into licensing arrangements with third party manufacturers with existing industry 
  experience and manufacturing capacity.

  We intend to take advantage of the fact that essentially all the components 
  of the CSRV® generator engine may be readily sourced and acquired from subcontractors, 
  and, accordingly, expect to manufacture the engine generator by developing assembly 
  lines within owned manufacturing facilities. We intend to initially commence 
  production of Gen Sets on a small scale. This will enable us to prove our concept 
  for the CSRV® system technology and we expect this will dovetail with the 
  existing substantial demand in the marketplace. We plan to address this demand 
  by establishing large scale manufacturing operations in the United States. Transitioning 
  to large scale manufacturing is expected to require a substantial increase in 
  our work force and substantial capital expenditures.


  Our ability to establish such manufacturing operations, recruit plant workers, 
  finance initial manufacturing inventories and fund capital expenditures is highly 
  dependent on our ability to successfully raise substantial new working capital 
  in an amount and at a pace which matches our business plans. Potential sources 
  of such new working capital include sales of our equity and/or debt securities 
  through private placement, pursuing and entering into additional sublicensing 
  agreements with OEM’s and/or distributors, positive working capital generated 
  from sales of our CSRV® products once we raise sufficient new working capital 
  and commence production. Although we have been successful in raising sufficient 
  working capital to continue our ongoing operations, we have encountered very 
  challenging credit and equity investment markets, and have not been able to 
  raise sufficient new working capital to enable us to commence production of 
  our CSRV® products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful 
  in raising adequate new working capital or even any new working capital to carry 
  out our business plans. The current economic environment, which is characterized 
  by tight credit markets, investor uncertainty about how to safely invest funds 
  and low investor confidence, has introduced additional risk and difficulty to 
  our challenge to secure such additional working capital.
