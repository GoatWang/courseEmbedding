Last Updated Sep 30, 2011 10:59 AM EDT

PepsiCo (PEP) has finally removed Massimo d'Amore as CEO of its Global Beverages Group, three years after he began a disastrous, self-indulgent makeover of Pepsi that has left the brand in tatters. He is replaced by Al P. Carey, former CEO of the Frito-Lay North America snack food business.
Although Pepsi's press release states that d'Amore will retain responsibility for Gatorade, Tropicana and Latin American beverages, that's a decidedly second-rung portfolio and he now reports to Carey instead of directly CEO Indra Nooyi. It's a demotion, he's banned from meddling with Pepsi anymore, and Nooyi wants to see a whole lot less of him, in other words. The enduring legacy of the d'Amore era will be Pepsi's humiliating slip from No.2 soda to No.3, behind Diet Coke.
As I noted in June, the company has spent so long in a series of management shuffles that management shuffling is now at the heart of its strategic problems.
This most recent shuffle -- it's at least the 14th re-ordering of senior executives since 2007 -- was accompanied by the departure of Eric J. Foss, CEO of the Pepsi Beverages Company, who was only given that title in February 2010. The company said Foss's departure was "contemplated by the terms of his agreement," to which the only rational reaction can be: What idiots appoint a CEO to their most important, most troubled brand, knowing he'll leave just a few months later?
Welcome to Pepsi

So, what happened? Many of the answers can be found in a 2009 Business Week story that described the arrival of d'Amore (pictured) atop Pepsi and his decision to destroy as much of the brand's heritage as quickly as possible. The scene opens:On Oct. 3, 2007, Nooyi and d'Amore were in Venice for meetings. During a break she asked him to walk with her in the gardens of the Hotel Cipriani. Would he run the beverages unit? she asked.
On the verge of the biggest recession in a generation, Nooyi and d'Amore were swanning through Venice like characters in a Merchant Ivory movie! D'Amore decided he wanted the seven brands he supervised, which included 1,121 different bottles, cans, and other packages, redesigned before the Super Bowl of 2009 -- a deadline that meant everything was rushed and there was no time for pre-market testing.
They called in wacky design guru Peter Arnell to handle the new logo and packaging for all Pepsi brands and Tropicana. The move was disastrous for Tropicana, comical for Pepsi and Arnell's over-reaching ego and lack of results led, ultimately, to him being fired from his own agency by holding company Omnicom (OMC).
Groupthink sets in

By this time, d'Amore, Nooyi and Arnell were talking only to themselves, BW reported:When d'Amore and Nooyi invited Arnell in to talk cola, no other Pepsi marketing people were present. Nooyi knew exactly what she was looking for. "The iPod is an elegant product people like to be seen with," she recalls telling Arnell. "I want Pepsi to be an elegant product people like to be seen with." Arnell was jazzed.
They chose a new target market:The demographic of people who march to the beat of their own drum, who say no even when it's unpopular, who say yes even when it's an uncomfortable change, who change a hundred-year-old brand icon because the new one is simply more beautiful and fitting for our times.
Translation: Having completely divorced themselves from the average American consumer (raising a family on an income of about $40,000 a year, far from the Cipriani Venice), they decided that Pepsi should be about themselves. Soda is a dollar-store, grocery-coupon business. It's also good for diluting rum and bourbon. Yet somehow d'Amore et al. concluded that "elegance" was the key to the brand.
The news of d'Amore's passing followed a 5 percent volume decline in North American sales of Pepsi's carbonated soft drinks in Q2 2011. D'Amore also cancelled an appearance at the Sept. 7 Barclays investor conference in Boston, Mass., because, the company said, he was "recuperating from minor surgery." I guess he needed stitches after removing Nooyi's shiv from his back.

                                        Eric J. Foss Announces Plans to Retire from PepsiCo Unit
 

                                        9/14/2011



















PURCHASE, N.Y., Sept. 14, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) today announced that Eric J. Foss, chief executive officer of one of its major operating divisions, the Pepsi Beverages Company (PBC), has notified the company that he is retiring, effective December 9, 2011.
Foss, 53, has led PBC since February, 2010, when he joined PepsiCo in the company's merger with its North American bottling operations.  Prior to the merger, Foss was Chairman and CEO of the publicly traded Pepsi Bottling Group from 2006 to 2010.  PepsiCo appointed Foss as head of PBC to facilitate a successful integration of the bottling operations into PepsiCo and to deliver agreed-upon synergies.  As contemplated by the terms of his agreement, Foss intends to return to a senior leadership role of a public company.  During his tenure at PBC, he provided steady leadership throughout the transition period and, with his team, delivered substantial synergies to PepsiCo.
"Eric has been a key member of the PepsiCo leadership team and has been a respected leader across global beverages for many years," said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra K. Nooyi.  "We are grateful to Eric for his willingness to stay with us for nearly two years to ensure a successful integration, and we are now well positioned for the future.  His deep operating experience and business savvy have been great assets to our company, and we wish Eric all the best in his future endeavors."
Foss will begin working immediately with the company's new beverage leadership team as part of the management transition.
"Having been part of the PepsiCo family for nearly three decades, when Indra asked me to stay on to lead the post-merger integration, I was pleased to partner with this great team," said Foss.  "Now, with that work successfully completed, I look forward to taking on significant new challenges." 
Foss continues to serve on the boards of directors of CIGNA, a global health services company, and of UDR, Inc., a multi-family real estate investment trust.
About PepsiCo

With net revenues of approximately $60 billion, PepsiCo's people are united by our unique commitment to sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet, which we believe also means a more successful future for PepsiCo. We call this commitment Performance with Purpose: PepsiCo's promise to provide a wide range of foods and beverages for local tastes; to find innovative ways to minimize our impact on the environment, including by conserving energy and water usage, and reducing packaging volume; to provide a great workplace for our associates; and to respect, support, and invest in the local communities where we operate.

Eric Foss at an Aramark Healthy for Life event


Enriching and Nourishing Lives


An Interview with Eric J. Foss, President and Chief Executive Officer, Aramark


Editors’ Note
Eric Foss was named to his current post in 2012. Prior to joining Aramark, Foss served as Chairman and CEO of Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG). He was named CEO and elected to the PBG Board of Directors in 2006 and elevated to PBG’s Chairman in 2008. Foss oversaw PBG’s acquisition by PepsiCo in 2010, and then led the integration of the business within the corporation serving as Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo’s Pepsi Beverages Company. Foss earned a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from Ball State University, and as an active alumnae was honored with the Miller College of Business Award of Distinction. Foss serves on the Board of Directors of Aramark, Cigna, and UDR, Inc. His passion for sports led to an ownership position he holds as a principal investor in the Omaha Stormchasers, the AAA affiliate of Major League Baseball’s Kansas City Royals and winners of the AAA National Championship in 2013.
Company Brief
Aramark (aramark.com) is in the customer service business across food, facilities, and uniforms, wherever people work, learn and play. United by a passion to serve, their more than 270,000 employees deliver experiences that enrich and nourish the lives of millions of people in 22 countries around the world every day. Aramark is recognized among the Most Admired Companies by FORTUNE and the World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute.
What is the heritage of Aramark and what makes this company so special?
Aramark started over 75 years ago with a lone entrepreneur selling peanuts out of the back of a pick-up truck, and has grown into a $14-billion FORTUNE 200 powerhouse that recently went public. What has driven our success from day one until now, and will drive our success forever, is a relentless entrepreneurial spirit with a total focus on and obsession with customer service.
What does customer service really mean, and have expectations changed?
Customer needs are constantly evolving. Great customer service organizations have a mindset to always let the marketplace set the table, and make sure they’re listening to the needs of their customers and consumers. As those needs change, as they invariably do in our dynamic world, it’s about being able to anticipate and adapt accordingly.
What customers expect most is service that is rooted in innovation and is meaningful to them – value, quality and, ultimately, delivering a great and consistent experience. That requires us to have a strong and repeatable business model that we follow day in and day out.
Where is the greatest innovation taking place in the company today?
Our mission at Aramark is to enrich and nourish lives. Driving our mission are two imperatives essential to our success: the fact that we dream, which is all about the importance of innovation, and the fact that we provide a great customer experience.
On the innovation side, it includes everything from product innovation to technology innovation to process innovation. Innovation is pervasive in the holistic approach we take to the products and services we offer, and ends up coming to life in a variety of ways. As an example on the food services side, we innovate to deliver an entirely different experience by partnering with iconic culinary leaders. This includes teaming up with Danny Meyer’s Shake Shack at Citi Field in New York, and DMK, the hottest burger concept in Chicago at Soldier Field, to name just a couple.
How do you offer a local feel in different markets but maintain consistency of the brand?
We behave like a $14-billion company and leverage our size, scale, and strength while making sure we have a consistent strategy, framework, and processes in our repeatable business model. We call our process Excel, which keeps us focused on achieving excellence in everything we do.
When it comes to a standard approach, our single minded goal is to be incredibly consistent in how we sell, serve, execute, operate, and market. Having said that, it’s also critical that we never lose that vital entrepreneurial spirit, which allows us to creatively activate on terms that are perfectly paired with the needs and wants of clients at the local level. It’s a delicate balance maintaining consistency of our framework with the nuances of the marketplace and our customers’ and our consumers’ unique needs.
How do you avoid losing that culture when you reach a certain size and scale?
The starting point is to understand the fundamental business you’re in. For us at Aramark, with 270,000 associates engaging tens of thousands of customers on any given day, and providing services to millions of consumers around the world, it certainly defines that we are in the people business.
So we like to focus on what we call our ‘service stars,’ our people who are involved with selling, marketing, and merchandising our products on the frontline. One of our core values is frontline first. It means ensuring that everything we do enables our service stars to deliver exceptional experiences to our customers and consumers exactly as they expect and deserve, every day and everywhere.
This not only unleashes their entrepreneurial spirit and empowers them to make the right decisions and trade-offs, but it helps us understand and provide them with the tools, processes, and technology they need to be successful at their jobs.
Will most of the growth for Aramark come from international markets?
The reality is that in the outsourcing business where we hold a lead position, the world is literally our industry’s oyster. About 50 percent of the businesses we serve are self-operated and have yet to be outsourced. This is especially the case in our healthcare, education, and business & industry sectors. This provides a sea of opportunity for us to continue to spur increased outsourcing, and that opportunity exists worldwide – irrespective of geography.
Looking at the opportunity more closely, the healthcare and education sectors are higher-growth opportunities for us. Geographically, emerging markets present a tremendous opportunity for growth. For example, we already have strong businesses in China and South America that are primed for continued growth. These geographies will be key to our future while we keep expanding in more established and developed markets.
Is there a growing international awareness of the value Aramark can bring?
It’s an education process. It is becoming more apparent to many leaders that no matter what their core business may be, a top driver of their own customer’s satisfaction is the food service offering. It’s the fourth most important reason, for instance, why a student selects a university or college. So our products are extremely important – not just to our customers but to the ultimate consumers.
It’s a real opportunity for organizations that are attempting to do this on their own when it’s not their core competency. Whether they are a hospital, a school, a ballpark, or an office, they can view outsourcing as an avenue to improve the overall experience of whatever they provide that leads to a renewed and added loyalty from their constituents who matters most.
Additionally, with increasing costs weighing on businesses, whether its wages or benefits like healthcare coverage, it is becoming increasingly important for organizations to look at outsourcing as a key opportunity for saving money and improving their customer’s experience. In the end, outsourcing is the ultimate virtuous circle, enabling a business to excel at what they do best by engaging Aramark to assist them by doing what we do best.•

Tweet 












Eric Foss is Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aramark (NYSE: ARMK), a $14 billion global provider of food, facilities and uniform services. The company employs 270,000 people and provides award-winning services wherever people work, learn, play and recover in 22 countries worldwide. Aramark clients include leading organizations spanning universities, colleges and school districts, healthcare institutions, municipalities, stadiums and arenas, and businesses.
 
Under Foss’ leadership, the company is poised for sustainable growth through driving new business generation and geographic expansion while improving profitability by establishing a repeatable business model through the global enterprise. Since Foss was named President and CEO in 2012, Aramark has recorded consistent growth in sales, new business and adjusted net income and operating margins. He also led the company’s successful return to the New York Stock Exchange in December 2013. Aramark is recognized among the “Most Admired Companies” by FORTUNE and the “World’s Most Ethical Companies” by the Ethisphere Institute. In February 2015, Foss was elected Chairman of the Aramark Board of Directors, assuming the new title of Chairman, President and CEO.
 
Prior to joining Aramark, Foss served as Chairman and CEO of Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), the world’s largest bottler of Pepsi-Cola beverages which manufactured, sold and distributed products in the U.S. and six other countries. Foss was named CEO and elected to the PBG Board of Directors in 2006 and elevated to PBG’s Chairman in 2008. He participated in the successful process of taking PBG public in 1999. Foss oversaw PBG's acquisition by PepsiCo in 2010, which brought outstanding value to PBG shareholders, and then led the integration of the business within the corporation serving as Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo's Pepsi Beverages Company.
 
Throughout his career with Aramark, PBG and PepsiCo, Foss has established a strong track record of generating profitable growth through integrated strategies and consistent execution that meets or exceeds financial commitments. Foss has led global teams to successfully build leading brands through a 'frontline first' mindset while achieving broad-based productivity gains.
 
Foss earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing from Ball State University, and as an active alumnae was honored with the Miller College of Business Award of Distinction. Foss serves on the Board of Directors of Aramark, Cigna and UDR, Inc. His passion for sports led to an ownership position he holds as a principal investor in the Omaha Stormchasers, the AAA affiliate of Major League Baseball’s (MLB) Kansas City Royals and winners of the AAA National Championship in 2013. He is the father of three daughters, Laura, Elizabeth and Kathryn, and resides with his family in Philadelphia, PA and Ridgefield, CT.

Foss Elected President, CEO of PBGCahill to remain executive chairman until early 2007









July 21, 2006SOMERS, N.Y. -- The Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. said its board has elected Eric J. Foss as president and CEO of the company effective immediately. Foss, 48, who most recently served as PBG's COO, was also elected to the company's board.Foss succeeds John T. Cahill, 49, who has been PBG's CEO since 2001. Cahill will remain as PBG's executive chairman and a member of the board through early 2007. Upon Cahill's departure early next year, the board has designated Barry H. Beracha, 64, currently one of PBG's independent directors, to assume the role of nonexecutive [image-nocss] chairman. Beracha was elected to PBG's board in March 1999.Cahill's accomplishments include building PBG into the leading bottler in the Pepsi network, gaining market share in a number of key regions, achieving double-digit growth in international territories, improving selling and execution across the organization, increasing PBG's cash flow and dividend and executing a number of successful acquisitions.Foss has garnered extensive experience in both the United States and overseas during his 24 years in the Pepsi system. During his tenure with PBG, he has led multiple initiatives designed to enhance PBG's customer relationships, increase the company's selling and execution capabilities and strengthen the organization.Foss most recently served PBG as its COO, a position to which he was named in September 2005. Prior to that, he served as president of PBG North America. He joined Pepsi-Cola Co. in 1982 and held a variety of increasingly responsible field and headquarters-based sales, marketing and general management positions. In 1990, Foss was named vice president of retail strategy for Pepsi-Cola North America (PCNA). From 1994 to 1996, he served as general manager of PCNA's Great West Business Unit. In 1996, he was named general manager of Pepsi-Cola's Central Europe business. He returned to the United States in February 1999, when he joined PBG as senior vice president of U.S. sales and field marketing. In 2000, Foss was appointed executive vice president and general manager of PBG North America and, a year later, was named president of PBG North America.PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Steve Reinemund, said, Since its founding in 1998, the Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) has been and remains one of PepsiCo's most trusted and valued partners. The same sentiment applies to the company's seasoned management team, many of whom devoted extensive time in their careers to PepsiCo before joining PBG.We are excited to welcome another highly respected leader and friend to the helm at PBG in Eric Foss. Eric is a strong and decisive leader, as demonstrated throughout his PBG tenure and 17 years earlier with PepsiCo. He has been an influential member of PBG's founding management team with Craig Weatherup and John Cahill, and has been involved in all the vital strategic decisions that have built the company into one of the world's best bottling operations. All of us at PepsiCo look forward to continuing to work with Eric and his team as we grow our mutually successful partnership to entirely new heights and firmly establish PBG and PepsiCo as two of the world's best consumer products companies.On behalf of everyone at PepsiCo, we also extend our gratitude and appreciation to John for his outstanding vision and leadership during the last eight years at PBG. During his tenure at PBG, and more than 10 years with PepsiCo previously, John consistently made his mark on the businesses and the industry, and the people in both, leaving an impressive and lasting legacy that will stand the test of time. He remains a loyal PBG and PepsiCo supporter and a good friend. He will be missed, although we know he will do exceedingly well in all his future endeavors. We wish him, Betsy and their family the very best.
