                    About TESSCO
                







TESSCO has a long and well established heritage in the wireless industry. We provided key equipment for the second ever cellular network built in the USA, in 1983.  And over 30 years later, TESSCO is continuing to set the pace as the leading value-added distributor to the wireless world.
We have strong relationships with the leading manufacturers that serve the wireless industry - relationships across a broader array of technologies than any other distributor - so that we can offer everything from the tower to the edge.
Our commitment to our customer’s success is demonstrated in 


The tens of thousands of customers we serve across a broad array of industries and markets;


Our relationships with manufacturing partners across a full spectrum of technologies;


Our focus on supply chain and distribution expertise, our specialized market knowledge and technical proficiency, and our broad range of solutions that augment our customers’ capabilities.  


In recognition of our outstanding quality, we have been awarded TL 9000 certification – the communication industry’s highest standard for operational excellence.
Wireless technology will continue to transform our lives.  TESSCO has the experience, expertise, and vision to stand at the forefront of the wireless evolution as the vital link connecting our partners and our customers.

Over the course of decades in the industry, we found that our customers have unmet needs – unique challenges and opportunities to enhance their wireless technology that were going unserved by our manufacturer partners. We have, through the brand name Ventev, created our own product development capability to deliver innovative solutions to support the needs of our commercial and retail markets. 
Under the Ventev name we design, manufacture, and distribute wireless infrastructure products including antennas, enclosures, and cable to deploy, protect, power, and improve the performance of wireless networks.

Certified ISO 9001:2008 and TL 9000:2017
What is a TL 9000 Certification? 
TL 9000 is a globally recognized standard of quality management and processes geared specifically towards the Information and Communications Technology Industry. TL 9000 defines the unique communications quality system requirements for design, development, production, delivery, and service and it specifies measurements utilized to evaluate a company’s effectiveness of quality implementation and improvement programs. TL 9000 provides a consistent set of quality expectations for partners and customers. 
    
What does TESSCO’s TL 9000 Certification mean for you, the customer?
     
By being TL 9000 Certified, we’re demonstrating our commitment to excellence and quality in the way we do business, making us your most reliable wireless partner. We are held to a high standard when it comes to streamlining, training, and documenting how we do business and our capabilities are regularly assessed and graded. We most recently passed our TL 9000 surveillance audit in May 2017, continuing our certification for the fifth straight year. Our biggest competitors in the wireless industry can’t say that. 
    
Additionally, because the TL 9000 Certification is specific to the Information and Communications Technology industry it reaffirms our expertise in the wireless industry. We are expert insiders in your business and being TL 9000 Certified places us in an exclusive club of fewer than 50 companies, along with major players like AT&T, Cisco, and Verizon, who share data and best practices to ensure best-in-class service across the industry.
    Our TL 9000 Certification is all part of our promise to you, our customers, to hold ourselves to the highest standards possible and to continually update and adapt the ways we do business to keep pace with the evolving landscape of the wireless industry.
