        James L. Wainscott, Awarded 2010 Gary Memorial Medal at AISI General Meeting
    


Washington, D.C., 5/6/2010 - The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) announced that James L. Wainscott is the 2010 recipient of the Gary Memorial Medal, the Institute’s highest honor.  Wainscott, AK Steel Corporation Chairman, President and CEO, was recognized with the award at the AISI 118th General Meeting in Boca Raton, FL., held May 2-4.  
In presenting the award, 2010-11 AISI Chairman Daniel R. DiMicco, chairman, president and CEO of Nucor Corporation., praised Wainscott for providing the commitment and leadership that was so significant during a period of economic crisis brought on by the global recession.
The medal’s inscription reads:
“In recognition of his outstanding leadership during a critical time in the history of our industry and our institute; for answering an early and extended call to leadership with insight, energy and enthusiasm; and for his eloquent voice on behalf of the industry to tell our story of vitality and commitment to the future.” 
Established in 1927, the Gary Medal is named for Judge Elbert H. Gary, the first president of AISI.  The medal recognizes an individual for his or her remarkable lifelong contributions to the North American steel industry. 
Wainscott has served the steel industry for nearly 30 years, beginning his steel career with the former National Steel Corporation where he held a number of executive level positions.  In 1995, Wainscott joined AK Steel as vice president and treasurer and was named chief financial officer in 1998.   In 2003, he was named president, CEO and a member of the board of directors of AK Steel.  In January of 2006, he was named chairman of the board of directors.  Wainscott is also a member of the board of directors of the Parker Hannifin Corporation. 
Under Mr. Wainscott’s leadership, AK Steel has achieved a dramatic turnaround to become a financially solid and globally-competitive steelmaker.  AK Steel produces flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, as well as carbon and stainless tubular steel products, primarily for automotive appliance, construction and electrical power generation and distribution markets.             
Wainscott recently served as AISI’s 2009-2010 Chairman, and previously served as the chairman of the Institute’s Policy and Planning Committee and as chairman of its Finance Committee. 
In addition to his service to AISI, he is a member of the Business Roundtable (and is a past board member of the Specialty Steel Industry of North America).  He is vice chairman of the board of directors of the Good Samaritan Hospital Foundation (Cincinnati), a member of the campaign board of Ohio Cancer Research Associates, and a member of the Executive Advisory Board of Ball State University’s Miller College of Business.  He previously was a board member of the Cincinnati Zoo and the Anthony Muñoz Foundation.   He and his wife, Darla, currently serve as co-chairs of the Building on a Legacy of Excellence campaign for the Children’s Home of Cincinnati.
Wainscott received a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from Ball State University and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Notre Dame.  He has been honored with Distinguished Alumni Awards from both Notre Dame and Ball State, as well as the Award of Distinction from Ball State’s Miller College of Business.
AISI serves as the voice of the North American steel industry in the public policy arena and advances the case for steel in the marketplace as the preferred material of choice.  AISI also plays a lead role in the development and application of new steels and steelmaking technology.  AISI is comprised of 31 member companies, including integrated and electric furnace steelmakers, and 130 associate and affiliate members who are suppliers to or customers of the steel industry.  AISI's member companies represent approximately 75 percent of both U.S. and North American steel capacity.  For more news about steel and its applications, view AISI’s website at www.steel.org.
