BOSTON, April 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC ("ArcLight") announced today that Penn Products Terminals, a newly-formed portfolio company, has acquired Pyramid LLC, formerly, Petroleum Products Corporation ("Pyramid (f/k/a PPC)"), a petroleum pipeline terminals and logistics business.  Pyramid (f/k/a PPC) owns and operates a network of 12 high-quality refined products storage terminal facilities in Pennsylvania totaling approximately 9 million barrels of storage capacity.  Pyramid (f/k/a PPC) stores gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, heating oil kerosene, ethanol and biodiesel and is a leading distributor of these products to customers in Pennsylvania and six surrounding states.  The terminals are pipeline, barge and rail-connected and supplied from a geographically diverse set of refined product sources including New York, Philadelphia, the Midwest and Gulf Coast.
Dan Revers, Managing Partner and Co-founder of ArcLight, said, "We have a long track record of investing in refined products storage and pipeline infrastructure and the acquisition of Pyramid (f/k/a PPC) is the culmination of that experience combined with a concerted effort by ArcLight over the last several years to invest in premiere infrastructure along the last mile of the value chain.  Pyramid (f/k/a PPC) is led by a highly experienced management team and will serve as a solid platform for follow-on investments in refined product storage and wholesale distribution."

Penn Haven










We are looking for a few financial partners to support the further development of our software.Over the next fifteen years, four of the six million small businesses with employees are expected to sell, transfer, or close.Fifty four percent of brokered, private nano-cap transactions fail to sell. This failure is largely a result of funds' inability to: generate proprietary deal flow, properly screen targets post contact, and in general, efficiently target small businesses. The result is over one million small businesses may simply close their doors.Penn Haven aims to bridge this divide between buyers and sellers through the use of our proprietary software.In high volume our software identifies, scores, contacts, and tracks small business acquisition targets. With a third of the staff, in one day we can run more volume than the average private equity fund can run in one year. Our A-B tested messages have a response rate 6 times the industry average. We better meet the demands of sellers by re-approaching the structure and process of private nano-cap transactions.We have the industry leading private equity software system. We are looking for a few financial partners to support our further development.If you are interested in learning more, we would enjoy connecting to share our investment memorandum.

Light Shield Products LLC 


437 S Highland St.
Lock Haven, PA 17745-3400 










 
 






	Steve Brion, owner and CEO of Light Shield Products LLC, has over 25 years of experience in search and rescue including roles as Police Chief, Fire Lieutenant, First Captain and Second Captain Firefighter/EMT. Throughout his career, he noticed problems with the lights available for firefighter helmets. Existing methods made the helmet clumsy and heavy, and did not allow for adjustable directional lighting –critical necessities for those putting their lives on the line.

	 

	Seeking to turn his ideas into a successful business, Steve reached out to the Lock Haven Small Business Development Center (SBDC), who helped him in business plan development, market research, competitor analysis, identifying sources of funding, and the basics of accounting.

	 

	His business consultant also helped connect him with the specialty Engineering Development Services (EDS) offered by the SBDC at Bucknell University. To help develop his concept prototypes for the “Level Light” into a real-world product, engineering staff and student consultants helped with computer aided design and advised on manufacturing processes. The Bucknell Small Business Development Center then made use of its NextEngine 3D Scanner and MakerBot Replicator™ 2 Desktop 3D Printer to design and produce several more prototypes of Steve’s designs. Using the business planning guidance provided by the Lock Haven SBDC along with the designs and prototypes created by Bucknell’s SBDC, he arrived at a final product design to move Light Shield Products LLC forward.

	 

	Steve credits the SBDCs’ assistance directly in helping Light Shield in obtaining the investments necessary to turn his idea into a reality. Sales of the new Level Light product began with its launch in May 2013 and new jobs have been created in sales, marketing, and accounting. Light Shield is growing by expanding its sales to new markets, including its first international sale to Canada, and by continuing to find new industries and applications for its products. Light Shield is now "lighting your way forward" with quality, versatility and affordability for search and rescue personnel and is available from retailers throughout the country.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
