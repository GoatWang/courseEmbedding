     Brian Ludwig joined Cvent in 2000, shortly after the company was founded. Brian was initially a top contributing sales rep and rose the ranks over the years.
 As SVP of Sales, he oversees Cvent�s worldwide sales of the flagship event management solutions division and the mobile app solutions division. To this end, Brian travels across the globe and is often called upon to speak at conferences regarding technology trends in the meetings industry.  Brian works very closely with leadership across the organization to help shape strategy and direction in terms of product roadmap, client services, marketing initiatives, operational efficiencies, and acquisitions.
Brian arrived at Cvent with a strong technology sales foundation. Brian worked as a Regional Sales Director for Lutron Electronics, an industry-leading lighting control systems manufacturer. Brian dramatically grew Lutron's footprint in the southern part of the United States. Brian's technical acumen landed him as a regular instructor of architects, engineers, and electrical contractors at Lutron's training institute.
Brian graduated with an MBA from University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith Business School, where he studied Entrepreneurship and Marketing. He graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BBA from Emory University's Goizueta Business School.

Few instruments in history have had the musical and social impact as the classic 6 string acoustic guitar. With over 4,000 years of recorded history, the acoustic guitar is one of our oldest and most treasured instruments, and now it is time to carve out your piece of musical history with a guitar of your own. When buying a 6 string acoustic guitar, there are a number of factors one should take into account. Most notably, acoustic guitars come in a variety of sizes. From smaller guitars all the way up to the legendary Dreadnought, it's important to find the size that best suits your needs. Also, the shape of the body changes from guitar to guitar with a cut-away design offering you easier access to the upper frets, which is certainly something a lot of players will appreciate. Equally as important to the body is the neck of your guitar. You will want to have a neck that you are comfortable holding in your hand. As a general rule, you can expect the size of your guitar's neck to directly correlate to the size of the body‰Û_ the smaller the guitar, the smaller the neck. Acoustic necks are usually listed as 12-fret or 14-fret, referring to the total number of frets that clear your guitar's body.As well, different types of wood will produce different types of tone for your guitar. A wide variety of options exist, each of which give you a distinct sound and tone. As you would expect, the quality of a guitar increases with the rarity of the wood used, so you will have plenty of options available to suit your sonic needs. The modern troubadour is alive and well in the music of artists like Jake Bugg and Frank Turner. The 6 string acoustic guitar has always played a crucial role as part of our popular culture, and now is your opportunity to continue the enduring legacy of this musical instrument. We have the Limited Edition Alvarez Grateful Dead 50th Anniversary Guitar in stock. Supply is limited, so get it while you can.

Brian Young






Biography & Career
								

    Over the last 20 years, Brian Young has earned a well-deserved reputation as one of the world_м_s premier power-pop drummers. He first gained attention as a member of the legendary Posies, one of the most influential and respected bands to emerge from the early-90_м_s Seattle scene. After recording and touring with the Posies for the first half of the nineties, he then joined New York_м_s Fountains of Wayne in 1996; the group has since recorded five highly acclaimed major label albums, were twice GRAMMY nominated in 2003 and have toured the world numerous times. Indeed, Brian_м_s diverse abilities allow him stretch far beyond the world of power pop. In his spare time, he has also managed to record (nearly 100 albums), produce and/or perform with artists such as America, Krist Novoselic, IVY, Jim Carroll, Burt Bacharach, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Walkabouts, Japanese pop megastar Junko Yagami, Tokyo's Broken Country Girls and numerous others.  In his playing, one can often detect classic influences like Cheap Trick_м_s Bun E. Carlos, Ringo Starr, and Blondie_м_s Clem Burke, combined with a hard-hitting, aggressive style befitting today_м_s modern rock.  Brian was featured by Modern Drummer Magazine in June, 2007 where he disclosed that his drumming has been influenced by _м_The great studio drummers of the 1970s and to some degree, every musician that I've ever heard or seen._м

The fact that he is a surgical anesthesiologist as well as a Pain Management Doctor makes him uniquely qualified to understand the mechanisms of a persons pain as he holds the lives of people in surgery in his hands every day and that requires an observant eye to ensure his patient lives through the surgery.  I have found him to be more observant and hands on than any doctor I have dealt with.  There use to be a philosophy in medicine you cannot heal with out touching the patient. today you go in and office and in most cases the doctor asks how you feel then orders tests leaves and comes back with the test results. In my experience the recent trend for doctors to not touch their patients has lead to the mass increase in malpractice Lawsuits.  If more doctors did a complete 3 minute exam of their patients while offering reassurance that all that could be done would be done there would to a 1000 fold increase in patient satisfaction with there doctors. There are so many things you can tell about a patient by doing a quick check of the general condition of the patient will instilling in them the feeling that they matter enough for you to touch them and see if you can find if there is anything that may have been missed in your telling of how you feel. The reduction in unnecessary tests, and misdiagnoses would drop dramatically. Dr. Hua is just such a man and he instills confidence that he has done all he can to take care of you.DR Quyen Luu MDFlor de maria V. ratedI was writing a Review, but sometime happened in my computer.

Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
