Turbopumps  Turbopumps - the pacesetters among vacuum pumps
Vacuum technology is essential for making many high-tech products used in everyday life. Numerous applications in research and industry, in fact, need a vacuum with an extremely low absolute pressure (high vacuum). Turbopumps have established themselves globally as the technological standard, having acquired their name from their turbine cousins. High-speed rotors with up to 90,000 rpm generate the pressure conditions required for application. This allows a vacuum of up to 10-11 mbar to be generated in the high and ultra-high vacuum range.
 


Turbopumps for perfect vacuum solutions to meet the highest requirementsPfeiffer Vacuum turbopumps are available for pumping speeds of between 10 and 2,700 liters per second. These pumps will win you over with their high cost-efficiency and flexibility. Pfeiffer Vacuum turbopumps with their optimized reliability use proven bearing systems which are available in two different options - a hybrid bearing system with a combination of a ceramic ball bearing on the forevacuum side and a permanently magnetic radial bearing on the high vacuum side, and a fully, active magnetic bearing system in which the rotor is levitated with no contact or wear at all.

 




  
Thanks to the sophisticated rotor design, extremely high pumping speed, critical backing pressure and gas throughput values are achieved as well as very good compression values for light gases.Pfeiffer Vacuum turbopumps stand for safetyModern turbopumps attain peripheral speeds of over 400 meters per second. This translates to a correspondingly high kinetic rotor energy which, if the rotor and stator were to touch, would transfer within a fraction of a second to the housing and the pump’s anchor system too. The stability of the outer casing of the pump is thus of vital importance and is tested both theoretically and experimentally. Our turbopumps are certified to UL 61010 and/or Semi S2. Besides the mechanical safety, the certification encompasses fire protection and two-fold protection against excess rotation speed, which Pfeiffer Vacuum has developed together with TÜV Rheinland. Key customer benefitsVacuum technology is often a key factor for successfully running production processes from start to finish. The costs incurred by faulty batches or production outages can easily run to millions of euros, depending on the application. This makes it all the more important to use components that provide maximum reliability. Today, it is not uncommon for turbopumps to reach an operating lifetime of up to 100,000 hours. This translates to an uninterrupted running time of some eleven years. During this time, the pump should result in as few scheduled interruptions as possible for maintenance or service work. Pfeiffer Vacuum turbopumps have extended diagnostic functions to meet this requirement. With the help of this data, maintenance is carried out based on the pump status. Any maintenance required is predictable and so can be scheduled by the user. Coupled with the unique fact that oil and bearing changes can be carried out on site, this results in maximum uptime. The turbopumps' integrated electronic drive unit significantly reduces cabling costs. State-of-the-art drive technology minimizes energy consumption while at the same time offering versatile control options. The IP 54 protection class design makes these pumps supremely suitable for industrial environments. Their compact design makes for easy integration even where space is at a premium. To minimize costs, there are various electronic drive units to choose from for each pump size. Even the weight factor has been subjected to scrutiny: a turbopump with a pumping speed of 250 liters per second weighs in at a mere 6 kilogrammes. The wide range of uses for Pfeiffer Vacuum turbopumps includes not only analytical, vacuum process and semiconductor technology but also coating, research and development and industrial applications.

ApplicationsIn the production of many products of everyday life and in many areas of engineering research, vacuum technology plays a decisive role. Here the turbopump is of decisive importance in providing extremely pure process conditions. Examples for applications can be found in many different areas: Analytics (mass spectrometry, electron microscopy)Semiconductor industry (electronic components, integrated circuits (ICs), solar cells)Optical/glass industry (heat protection, anti-reflection, reflection, optical filter coatings)Coating technology (surface protection, decorative coatings, displays, screens)Vacuum metallurgy (vacuum soldering, vacuum sintering, vacuum alloys, vacuum furnaces)Leak detection (vacuum systems, vehicle fuel tanks, airbag cartridges, packages)Research facilities (nuclear particle physics, fusion research, Laser applications)Lamp industry (lamp production)

Leak Detectors  Pfeiffer Vacuum leak detectors trace every leak.
Leak detectors: the answer to all your leaks, no matter how big or smallNo leak is too small or too big to escape our leak detectors. It doesn’t matter whether you are looking for water, oil, fuel, refrigerant, gas, steam, air or vacuum leaks. From miniature electronic units right up to large-volume vessels, from media escaping from vacuum systems to gases entering them – the uses for leak detectors are as broad as the range of industrial products. The extensive range of Pfeiffer Vacuum leak detectors provides the answer for all these requirements.
 




 




 




 




 




 




 




 




 




  
Leak detectors for various requirements: portable, compact and stationary unitsOur portable leak detectors are used both for mobile leak detection “on site”, such as company premises, as well as for worldwide service jobs in a variety of different locations. Our leak detectors stand out above all due to their high performance combined with low weight.The compact leak detectors are used first and foremost for stationary applications to detect leaks and test for leak tightness. They are also portable thanks to a special leak detector cart. Compact leak detectors are used in widely ranging industries, from applications in heavy industry right up to clean room applications. In this latter case, the dry versions of the leak detectors are being used.Stationary high-performance leak detectors are used where extremely short cycle times and fast cleanup of Helium background are required. Our leak detectors of the ASM 192 and ASM 1002 series are used in applications ranging from large-scale testing of electronic components for leak tightness up to highly sensitive applications in vacuum and medical technology or research and development.Leak detection with the test gas Helium: Safe. Quantitative. Repeatable.Helium leak detectors are the ideal solution for leak detection and leak-tightness testing under vacuum. The test gas Helium is safe and a small, light molecule which is suitable for detecting micro leaks. The detection range of Helium in vacuum tests lies between 10-2 and 10-13 Pa · m3/s. Helium leak detection is extremely accurate, quantitative and repeatable. Fast cycle times are a further advantage.     Manual sniffing or spraying is often the easiest way to detect a leak with Helium. But it is also possible to use automatic leak detection solutions which are independent of the operator and provide a considerably higher detecting speed. The integral leak detection is designed to achieve pre-defined quality and component throughput levels.The use of test gas leak detection methods has the bonus of delivering extra data compared to traditional leak detection methods such as bubble testing or pressure drop methods. These data can be used to improve production processes and successfully detect every leak.

Calibration systems  Calibration systems for vacuum gauges
In view of increasingly stringent quality assurance requirements where the accuracy and reproducibility of the vacuum measured during production and service work is essential as well as the vacuum gauges required for this, the demand for calibration systems is steadily increasing in the market place. In critical processes, the accuracy of vacuum measurements is important for process stability, quality and for monitoring these processes. The pharmaceutical industry requires precise vacuum measurements for safeguarding its high quality product. This is the case particularly in freeze drying expensive drugs. For this reason, regular calibration of vacuum gauges is required. This also applies for final vacuum measurements on vacuum systems in service applications in line with factory or international standards.  To cover the majority of applications, Pfeiffer Vacuum has developed two calibration systems - Basic and Pro system.
 


Calibration system BasicFor static and dynamic calibrationCalibration range 1.013 – 10-4 hPaEasy to use Chamber ISO/TS 3567- compliantUp to 3 reference gauges for medium accuracyDAkkS-certified reference gaugesFlexible  We also deliver customized solutions

 


Calibration system ProFor static and dynamic calibrationCalibration range 1.013 – 10-4 hPaEasy to use Chamber ISO/TS 3567-compliant Up to 5 reference gauges for high accuracy DAkkS-certified reference gaugesFlexible  We also deliver customized solutions

  
ApplicationsFreeze-drying in the pharmaceutical and food industryCoating systems for optics, ophthalmics, decorative coatings, diffusion barrier layers for PET bottles and packaging films, wear protection coatings for tools, etc., incorporating the use of multiple measuring instruments. Final vacuum measurement in pump production and service workshopsProcess monitoring and process control for determining the end of the process, in order to produce consistent quality and minimize rejection rates. Calibration methodsCalibration is based on a comparison of the measurement values of the gauge to be calibrated and the reference gauge according to ISO/TS 3567. The gauge to be calibrated and the calibrated reference gauges are connected to a standardized vacuum chamber (according to ISO/TS 3567, form b) and are exposed to the same vacuum. There are two basic methods of calibration – static and dynamic calibration. With the calibration systems supplied by Pfeiffer Vacuum, transmitters can be calibrated statically with a measuring range of > 1 hPa as well as dynamically with a measuring range of < 1 hPa.
  
Overview

The calibration accuracy required defines the number of reference gauges needed.

 
Calibration system Basic (calibration range 1,013 – 10-4 hPa)

Accuracy profile for the calibrated gauge with 5 reference gaugesDuring calibration with 3 reference gauges, the following calibrating accuracy is obtained:0.2% accuracy at 1,013 hPa0.8% accuracy at 2 hPa 0.2% accuracy at 0.1 hPa10% accuracy at 10-4 hPaCalibration with 3 reference gauges obtains an accuracy of 0.2 – 0.8% in the pressure range from atmospheric pressure (1,013 hPa) to 0.1 hPa. The Pfeiffer Vacuum Calibration system Basic is required for this purpose.

 
Calibration system Pro (calibration range 1,013 – 10-4 hPa)

Accuracy profile for the calibrated gauge with 5 reference gaugesDuring calibration with 5 reference gauges, the following calibrating accuracy is obtained:0.2% accuracy between 1,013 – 0.1 hPa 1.0% accuracy at 10-3 hPa10% accuracy at 10-4 hPaCalibration with 5 reference gauges obtains an accuracy of 0.2% in a wide pressure range from atmospheric pressure (1,013 hPa) to 0.1 hPa. It allows precise vacuum measurement over a wide range from 1,013 to 10-2 hPa. The Pfeiffer Vacuum Calibration system Pro is required for this purpose.




Example of accuracy level of reference and calibrated gauges
 


StandardUnit under calibrationp (hPa)p (hPa)1,003 · 10-41,004 · 10-42,001 · 10-42,002 · 10-44,004 · 10-44,006 · 10-47,003 · 10-47,005 · 10-41,001 · 10-31,005 · 10-3

 

 
  
The reference gauges values and the gauges to be calibrated must be determined for every defined pressure. According to ISO/TS 3567, at least 3 measuring points must be taken into account (e. g. 1, 2 and 7 in above table). The calibration results must be recorded in a calibration certificate in compliance with DKD 6-2 of the German Calibration Service (DKD) and be kept as proof of this. The user decides whether the deviations from the reference values are admissible. The deviations shown in the above table are sufficiently accurate.

Pfeiffer, Michael R
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Pfeiffer, Michael R carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Pfeiffer, Michael R



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Pfeiffer, Michael R



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
