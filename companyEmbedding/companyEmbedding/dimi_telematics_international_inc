(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS.  Forward-looking Statements  We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this quarterly report and other filings with the SEC, reports to our stockholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations, estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "project," "forecast," "may," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report to conform forward-looking statements to actual results. Important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning uncertainties, including but not limited to, uncertainties associated with the following:   Inadequate capital and barriers to raising the additional capital or to obtaining the financing needed to implement our business plans;   Our failure to earn revenues or profits;   Inadequate capital to continue business;   Volatility or decline of our stock price;   Potential fluctuation in quarterly results;   Rapid and significant changes in markets;   Litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties; and   Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this quarterly report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors.  Overview  Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. (the "Old Corporation") a Colorado corporation, was formed on July 29, 1988. Pursuant to a Plan of Merger dated February 24, 2004, the Old Corporation filed Articles and Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado merging the Old Corporation into Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. (the "Surviving Corporation"), a Colorado corporation. A previous controlling shareholder group of the Old Corporation arranged the merger for business reasons that did not materialize. On April 26, 2004, the Surviving Corporation effected a 1-for-200 reverse stock split. The name of the Surviving Corporation was changed to First Quantum Ventures, Inc., on April 27, 2004. On April 13, 2006 the Surviving Corporation formed a wholly owned subsidiary, a Nevada corporation named First Quantum Ventures, Inc., and on May 5, 2006 merged the Surviving Corporation with and into this subsidiary, referred to herein as DTII. On February 20, 2014 the Company effected a 1-for-100 reverse stock split and increased its authorized common stock shares to 800,000,000.  As disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 16, 2011, on October 28, 2011, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Andrew Godfrey, our Chief Executive Officer, DiMi Telematics, Inc. ("DTI") and the holders of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DiMi Telematics (the "DiMi Shareholders"). Under the Exchange Agreement, we exchanged 874,500 shares of our common stock (pre-split) (the "First Quantum Shares") for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of DTI (the "DiMi Shares"). The exchange of the DiMi Shares for the First Quantum Shares is hereinafter referred to as the "Share Exchange." The First Quantum Shares issued in the Share Exchange represent 85.8% of our issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, DTI became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the Share Exchange, (a) 150,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock owned by Kesgood Company, Inc. were surrendered for cancellation and (b) our officers and directors resigned and the following individuals assumed their duties as officers and directors:  Name Title(s) Barry Tenzer President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director Roberto Fata Executive Vice President - Business Development and Director  The Share Exchange qualified as a transaction exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and under the applicable securities laws of each jurisdiction where any of the stockholders reside.  On March 15, 2012, the Company changed its name to DiMi Telematics International, Inc.  On April 16, 2012 the Company issued a 1 for 1 stock dividend to its then stockholders of record whereby the Company issued an additional 1,018,792 shares of common stock. On May 16, 2012 the Company issued an additional 1 for 1 stock dividend to its then stockholders of record whereby an additional 2,138,585 shares were issued. The outstanding warrants were automatically adjusted accordingly. The Company has reflected the dividends as splits, which have been retroactively reflected in the financial statements.  The Company designs, develops and distributes Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications solutions used to remotely track, monitor, manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in real-time from virtually any web-enabled desktop computer or mobile device. Through our proprietary software and hosted service offerings, DTI is endeavoring to capitalize on the pervasiveness and data transport capabilities of wireless networks in order to facilitate communications and process efficiencies between commercial and industrial business owners/managers and their respective networked control systems, sensors and devices.  The Company is focused on the M2M market segments in which we can provide highly differentiated and value-driven solutions capable of unleashing tangible productivity gains, material cost reductions and quantifiable risk mitigation across an enterprise. Aside from the oversight and administration of our corporate, financial and legal affairs by the executive management team, our Company's operating activities are centralized in three core areas:  Sales and Marketing, which will employ both direct and indirect sales models utilizing an in-house business development team, partners and resellers and self-service through a service on-demand web interface.  Operations, which will be responsible for managing daily activities related to monitoring and administering our cloud-based server operations; 24/7 client service/help desk; professional services and installation support; and quality assurance and testing of our DiMi software and hosting platform, as well as the implementation and ongoing administration of our hosted clients' M2M communications platforms.  Product Development, which will be charged with enhancing our existing M2M software applications and services and introducing new and complementary hosted products and applications on a timely basis. We anticipate that the creative formulation of enhancements and new product conceptualization will be performed in-house by our officers and directors. Thereafter, we intend to outsource software enhancement and product development to outside third parties.  PLAN OF OPERATIONS  Product Development Plan  Product development will be charged with enhancing our existing M2M software applications and services and introducing new and complementary hosted products and applications on a timely basis.  The primary building blocks of M2M technology on which the Company has focused its development activities have been and will remain:  � Building an expert knowledge base of existing and emerging electronics/technologies that enable geo-location, remote monitoring and control, auto-diagnostics and object identification;  � Engagement of a cloud computing platform that enables ubiquitous, scalable and on-demand network access;  � Development of proprietary software that controls two-way communication events, acts on predefined rules and delivers users a customized web interface that is accessible 24/7 from any web-enabled computer or device anywhere on Earth; and  � Information systems that enable users to process management solutions that allow for exploiting the information gathered for intelligent decision-making purposes and enhanced situational awareness.  The Company's proprietary M2M solution utilizes a cloud-based, two-way communications delivery platform, marketed as "DiMi." Leveraging the power, scalability and flexible turnkey advantages of DiMi's patent-pending software and hosting platform, users are able to remotely track, monitor, manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in real-time from virtually any web-enabled desktop computer or mobile device while located anywhere in the world.  DiMi features a robust, customized interface that gives its users secure command and control functionality of multiple remote, connected sensors, alarms and diagnostic devices. Moreover, the intuitive DiMi framework readily adapts to and integrates both new and legacy monitoring/sensing equipment - irrespective of make, model or manufacturer - providing for simplified, economical M2M deployments.  DiMi is delivered as a monthly, hosted service that puts critical information into the palm of its user's hands with no major hardware investments. Our hosting platform can be tailored for each customer to create secure and reliable end-to-end connectivity between their specific remote connected equipment and DiMi's proprietary web interface.  The newest version of DiMi is currently being beta tested in anticipation of the initial commercial roll-out of version 4.0, which it is anticipated will take place in the first calendar quarter of 2015. Pursuant to an agreement dated September 18, 2014, we agreed to pay our outsource software developer, Creative Media Farm SL, an aggregate sum of $250,000 for the development of DiMi 4.0. On August 5, 2013, we agreed to extend and amend our agreement with our outsource software developer to: (i) continue to develop drivers and improvements to the DiMi version 4.0 platform, the work for which was initially anticipated to be complete by January, 2014 but is now anticipated to be complete by March, 2015; and (ii) begin work on smartphone apps to allow version 4.0 to be fully accessible from smartphones, the work for which was completed and delivered to us on February 10, 2014. The extended agreement requires us to pay our outsource software developer: (i) $14,400 per month for a total of six months in order to complete the development of the drivers and improvements to the DiMi version 4.0 platform; and (ii) a total of $13,800 for the development of smartphone apps to work in conjunction with DiMi version 4.0  Marketing Plan  Strategically, the Company is focused on the M2M market segments in which we can provide highly differentiated and value-driven solutions capable of unleashing tangible productivity gains, material cost reductions and quantifiable risk mitigation across an enterprise.  We have also taken - and will continue to take - the necessary steps to secure the proprietary aspects of our applications through patent filings in the U.S. and in key international markets. Moreover, we intend to remain focused on proactively developing best-of-breed Internet-enabled M2M solutions that will effectively meet the evolving needs of our primary target market, namely web-based remote asset tracking, management and control with applications in the commercial, industrial, educational, government and military sectors.  As soon as practicable, the Company intends to concentrate its commercialization efforts on marketing the DiMi solution to property management companies, commercial property developers, government/military installations, industrial facilities, retail and restaurant chains, colleges and universities, fleet managers, and any business or institutional concern with valuable fixed and mobile assets requiring remote surveillance, regular maintenance or general oversight.  In order to achieve accelerated market penetration and sustainable, recurring revenue from a global customer base, The Company expects to ultimately adopt a hybrid sales and marketing model involving direct sales (Solutions Team); channel sales (via leading Value-Added Resellers ("VARs") and distributors dedicated to niche market applications that DiMi is capable of addressing in target domestic and international markets); and strategic marketing and integration collaborations with industry leading system integrators, Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") and large cellular carriers and dealers.  Competition  We believe we have a competitive advantage and are well positioned as an M2M solution-centric business since our M2M communications platform is hardware-agnostic, and our hosting environment is in the cloud - this gives us the ability to help businesses lower their IT infrastructure costs and management requirements while improving performance, scalability and flexibility.  Our consultative approach to enabling hosted M2M technologies for our clients - as well as the attention we give to their specific needs, requirements and circumstances - are critical competitive differentiators that we are dedicated to preserving and nurturing as we grow. Moreover, prudent and timely integration of new and emerging digital and web technologies into our M2M communications platform will remain an underpinning mission for DTI if we are to earn and maintain distinction as a recognized industry leader.  Employees  As of May 31, 2015, the Company's CEO is the only employee.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  As of May 31, 2015, we had cash of $236,476 and net working capital of $220,743.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared contemplating a continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has reported a net loss of $214,519 for the nine months ended May 31, 2015 and had an accumulated deficit of $1,545,976.  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. The primary source of capital has been from the sale of equity securities. Our primary use of capital has been for professional fees, and general and administrative costs. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, found in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Where possible, we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as "anticipate," "believe," "intends," or similar expressions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements due to important factors and risks including, but not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.  Forward-looking Statements  We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this annual report and other filings with the SEC, reports to our stockholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations, estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "project," "forecast," "may," "should," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this annual report to conform forward-looking statements to actual results. Important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning uncertainties, including but not limited to, uncertainties associated with the following:  ? Inadequate capital and barriers to raising the additional capital or to obtaining the financing needed to implement our business plans;  ? Our failure to earn revenues or profits;  ? Inadequate capital to continue business;  ? Volatility or decline of our stock price;  ? Potential fluctuation in quarterly results;  ? Rapid and significant changes in markets;  ? Litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties; and  ? Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors.  Overview  Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. (the "Old Corporation") a Colorado corporation, was formed on July 29, 1988. Pursuant to a Plan of Merger dated February 24, 2004, the Old Corporation filed Articles and Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado merging the Old Corporation into Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. (the "Surviving Corporation"), a Colorado corporation. A previous controlling stockholder group of the Old Corporation arranged the merger for business reasons that did not materialize. On April 26, 2004, the Surviving Corporation effected a 1-for-200 reverse stock split. The name of the Surviving Corporation was changed to First Quantum Ventures, Inc., on April 27, 2004. On April 13, 2006 the Surviving Corporation formed a wholly owned subsidiary, a Nevada corporation named First Quantum Ventures, Inc., and on May 5, 2006 merged the Surviving Corporation with and into this subsidiary, referred to herein as DTII.  As disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 16, 2011, on October 28, 2011, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Andrew Godfrey, our then Chief Executive Officer, DTI and the holders of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DTI (the "DiMi Stockholders"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we exchanged 29,150,000 shares of our common stock (the "First Quantum Shares") for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of DTI (the "DiMi Shares"). The exchange of the DiMi Shares for the First Quantum Shares is hereinafter referred to as the "Share Exchange." The First Quantum Shares issued in the Share Exchange represented 85.8% of our issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, DTI became DTII's wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the Share Exchange, (a) 5,000,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock owned by Kesgood Company, Inc. were surrendered for cancellation and (b) our officers and directors resigned and the following individuals assumed their duties as officers and directors:  Name Title(s) Barry Tenzer President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director Roberto Fata Executive Vice President - Business Development and Director  The Share Exchange qualified as a transaction exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and under the applicable securities laws of each jurisdiction where any of the stockholders reside.  On March 15, 2012, the Company changed its name to DiMi Telematics, International, Inc.  On April 16, 2012 the Company issued a 1 for 1 stock dividend to current stockholders whereby the Company issued an additional 33,959,744 shares of common stock. On May 16, 2012 the Company issued an additional 1 for 1 stock dividend to current stockholders whereby an additional 71,286,155 shares were issued. The dividends include outstanding warrants. The Company has reflected the dividends as splits, which have been retroactively reflected in the financial statements.  The Company designs, develops and distributes Machine-to-Machine ("M2M") communications solutions used to remotely track, monitor, manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in real-time from virtually any web-enabled desktop computer or mobile device. Through our proprietary software and hosted service offerings, the Company is endeavoring to capitalize on the pervasiveness and data transport capabilities of wireless networks in order to facilitate communications and process efficiencies between commercial and industrial business owners/managers and their respective networked control systems, sensors and devices.  The Company is focused on the M2M market segments in which we can provide highly differentiated and value-driven solutions capable of unleashing tangible productivity gains, material cost reductions and quantifiable risk mitigation across an enterprise. Aside from the oversight and administration of our corporate, financial and legal affairs by the executive management team, our Company's operating activities are centralized in three core areas:  Sales and Marketing will employ both direct and indirect sales models utilizing an in-house business development team, partners and resellers and self-service through a service on-demand web interface.  Operations will be responsible for managing daily activities related to monitoring and administering our cloud-based server operations, 24/7 client service/help desk, professional services and installation support and quality assurance and testing of our DiMi software and hosting platform, as well as the implementation and ongoing administration of our hosted clients' M2M communications platforms.  Product Development will be charged with enhancing our existing M2M software applications and services and introducing new and complementary hosted products and applications on a timely basis. We anticipate that the creative formulation of enhancements and new product conceptualization will be performed in-house by our officers and directors. Thereafter, we intend to outsource software enhancement and product development to outside third parties.  Plan of Operations  Product Development Plan  Product development will be charged with enhancing our existing M2M software applications and services and introducing new and complementary hosted products and applications on a timely basis.  The primary building blocks of M2M technology on which the Company has focused its development activities have been and will remain:  ? Building an expert knowledge base of existing and emerging electronics/technologies that enable geo-location, remote monitoring and control, auto-diagnostics and object identification;  ? Engagement of a cloud computing platform that enables ubiquitous, scalable and on-demand network access;  ? Development of proprietary software that controls two-way communication events, acts on predefined rules and delivers users a customized web interface that is accessible 24/7 from any web-enabled computer or device anywhere on Earth; and  ? Information systems that enable users to process management solutions that allow for exploiting the information gathered for intelligent decision-making purposes and enhanced situational awareness.  The Company's proprietary M2M solutions utilize a cloud-based, two-way communications delivery platform, marketed as "DiMi." Leveraging the power, scalability and flexible turnkey advantages of DiMi's patent-pending software and hosting platform, users are able to remotely track, monitor, manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in real-time from virtually any web-enabled desktop computer or mobile device while located anywhere in the world.  DiMi features a robust, customized interface that gives its users secure command and control functionality of multiple remote, connected sensors, alarms and diagnostic devices. Moreover, the intuitive DiMi framework readily adapts to and integrates both new and legacy monitoring/sensing equipment - irrespective of make, model or manufacturer - providing for simplified, economical M2M deployments.  DiMi is delivered as a monthly, hosted service that puts critical information into the palm of its user's hands with no major hardware investments. Our hosting platform can be tailored for each customer to create secure and reliable end-to-end connectivity between their specific remote connected equipment and DiMi's proprietary web interface.  The newest version of DiMi is to begin beta tested in anticipation of the initial commercial roll-out of version 4.0, which it is anticipated will take place in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Pursuant to an agreement dated September 18, 2014, we agreed to pay our outsource software developer, Creative Media Farm SL, an aggregate sum of $250,000 for the development of DiMi4.0. On August 5, 2013, we agreed to extend and amend our agreement with our outsource software developer to: (i) continue to develop drivers and improvements to the DiMi version 4.0 platform, the work for which was initially anticipated to be complete by January, 2014 but is now anticipated to be complete by March 2016; and (ii) begin work on smartphone apps to allow version 4.0 to be fully accessible from smartphones, the work for which was completed and delivered to us on February 10, 2014. The extended agreement requires us to pay our outsource software developer: (i) $14,400 per month for a total of six months in order to complete the development of the drivers and improvements to the DiMi version 4.0 platform; and (ii) a total of $13,800 for the development of smartphone apps to work in conjunction with DiMi version 4.0. The services were complete and payments for the extensions were paid between August 2013 and April 2014.  Marketing Plan  Strategically, the Company is focused on the M2M market segments in which we can provide highly differentiated and value-driven solutions capable of unleashing tangible productivity gains, material cost reductions and quantifiable risk mitigation across an enterprise.  We have also taken, and will continue to take, the necessary steps to secure the proprietary aspects of our applications through patent filings in the U.S. and in key international markets. Moreover, we intend to remain focused on proactively developing best-of-breed Internet-enabled M2M solutions that will effectively meet the evolving needs of our primary target market, namely web-based remote asset tracking, management and control with applications in the commercial, industrial, educational, government and military sectors.  As soon as practicable, the Company intends to concentrate its DiMi commercialization efforts on marketing the solution to property management companies, commercial property developers, government/military installations, industrial facilities, retail and restaurant chains, colleges and universities, fleet managers, and any business or institutional concern with valuable fixed and mobile assets requiring remote surveillance, regular maintenance or general oversight.  In order to achieve accelerated market penetration and sustainable, recurring revenue from a global customer base, the Company expects to ultimately adopt a hybrid sales and marketing model involving direct sales (solutions team), channel sales (via leading Value-Added Resellers (VARs) and distributors dedicated to niche market applications that DiMi is capable of addressing in target domestic and international markets) and strategic marketing and integration collaborations with industry leading system integrators, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and large cellular carriers and dealers.  Employees  As of August 31, 2015, the Company employed no full time and no part time employees other than its Chief Executive Officer.

DiMi Telematics International, Inc.    www.dimitelematics.com & www.DiMispeaks.com    The Missing Piece of the Cloud M2M Computing Puzzle     Meet the new kid on the M2M block growing over 500% in 2012. With nearly $1 million in working capital DiMi Telematics International, Inc.'s target date to go commercial with its unique cloud-based DiMiSpeaks'  software and communications platform  is early 2013. DiMi's initial focus will be   on property management companies. Other key sectors like education, health care and the military will be targeted too.   Entrepreneur Roberto Fata believes M2M (machines-to- machines) internet will be the largest most profound technology revolution of our lifetime. It has limitless potential for transforming how people and companies remotely track, monitor, manage and protect multiple fixed and mobile assets in their supply chain and develop cost savings in real-time from anywhere on earth. Hardware indifferent, DiMi is the missing piece of the Cloud M2M computing puzzle. Says Fata, "We intend to lead the charge!"    By Robert J. Flaherty and Arnaldo Arroyo    In this issue we are featuring DiMi Telematics International (OTCQB:DIMI), a development-stage software start-up. DiMi is currently in the process of completing and honing the latest version of its cloud-based M2M proprietary business intelligence communications platform to go commercial in the first quarter of 2013. What promises to give DiMi's technology platform a strong competitive edge is that it is "hardware indifferent." That edge is what its creator believes makes DiMi the only technology that captures and integrates real-time data from virtually all of the standard networked control systems, sensors and devices. Through use of a PC, laptop or mobile phone, DiMi Speaks software and DiMi platform will enable the end user in a very cost-effective way to monitor and control multiple fixed facilities and mobile assets remotely from anywhere in the world in real time.   DiMi's solution is currently being used to actively monitor property management systems in seven of the Fata family's commercial and residential buildings in East Harlem, NY - all beta sites which have served to successfully prove the technology and M2M communications platform. DiMi has also successfully worked out all of the bugs from previous versions of DiMi. "Dimmi" means "tell me" in Italian. Right now, programmers are in the process of developing the DiMi 4.0 version. Besides making the control console more attractive, the upgrade will provide a number of technological advancements as well as voice-over-the-internet protocol. Two new APPs are being added. Commercial launch is anticipated in the first quarter of 2013. The company has filed for patent protection in the U.S. as well as 40 other countries.   This DiMiSpeaks start-up appears to be in the right place at the right time. The global market for M2M should soar from $50 billion in 2011 five -fold to $250 billion in 2012, according to Focal Point Consulting Group. Beecham Research reports that service- enablement- services (like DiMiSpeaks software and DiMi hosting) are set to become a key differentiator in the machine-to-machine (M2M) market and achieve a total market value of $2.2 billion worldwide by 2014 , up from just $350 million in 2011. Jupiter Research forecasts that new service revenues across industries including energy, automotive, transport and healthcare will top $35 billion by 2016.    According to GSMA, an industry association representing the interests of over 800 mobile operators worldwide, there will be a connected universe of up to 50 billion M2M devices developed over the next 15 years. Dumb devices which are not networked will rapidly decrease in value and new dumb models will be more difficult to market. Consequently, this will create even greater pressure to make buildings and devices smarter and to be connected online.   The race is on to develop the software systems which will make this meteoric growth happen. DiMi's proprietary M2M solutions utilize a cloud-based, two-way wireless communication delivery platform, marketed as "DiMi." Leveraging the power , scalability and flexibility turnkey advantages of DiMi's patent-pending software and hosting DiMi platform , users are able to remotely track , monitor , manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in real-time from virtually any web-based computer or mobile device located anywhere in the world.   DiMi features a robust, customized interface that gives its users secure command and control functionality of multiple remote, connected sensors, alarms and diagnostic devices. The intuitive DiMi framework readily adapts to and integrates both new and legacy monitoring/sensing equipment-irrespective of make, model or manufacturer providing for simplified, economical M2M deployments.   DiMi is delivered as a monthly, hosted service that puts critical information into the palm of its user's hands with no major hardware investments. DiMi's hosting platform can be tailored for each customer to create secure and reliable end-to-end connectivity between their specific remote connected equipment and DiMi's proprietary web interface.   Since the hosting platform is cloud-based, DiMi's ability to help property managers lower their IT infrastructure costs and management requirements will make the DiMi communications platform more commercially attractive. What will separate DiMi from other companies in its property management technology niche is that its M2M communications platform is hardware indifferent. What this term basically means is that regardless of the type of hardware system that a property management company is now using they can all be operated, monitored and controlled over the DiMi platform. This is a big selling point considering that current systems on the market such as Crestron, Lutron and Elk Security, among others, can only be operated and controlled over their own individual platforms.   "This is what makes DiMi different than anything else- all the other systems work only with their own devices," says Roberto Fata, who is co-founder, executive vice president and creator of the DiMi technology. "We're software-based, so we're indifferent to what your hardware is. As long as it can communicate, we can make your lighting system talk to your car key access system, talk to your air conditioning /heating system, talk to water sensors, talk to all sorts of different systems. What's more, the DiMi system is user friendly. If you can text, you can use DiMi."   Because this property manager has been tinkering with DiMi since 2002 Fata's system has a surprisingly broad menu of what can be monitored and controlled from his portable I-Pad as he walks along. He is especially proud of how proper access and some other activities by cleaning people, vendors and importantly former employees can be monitored. Current employees or students also can be monitored to see when they arrive or leave or fail to show up.   While the company's initial marketing efforts naturally will focus on the commercial and residential property management sectors, DiMi plans to expand its commercial efforts to include a number of other key economic sectors such as government and military installations, industrial facilities, retail and restaurant chains, colleges and universities, fleet managers and any business or institutional concern with valuable fixed and mobile assets requiring remote surveillance, regular maintenance or general oversight. Roberto has four "dynamite ideas" to apply to healthcare but doesn't dare be more specific for competitive reasons. Why give potential copycats a head start?   To achieve strong accelerated market penetration and sustainable revenue from a global customer base, DiMi will adopt a hybrid sales and marketing model. It will involve strategy to include direct sales solutions teams, channel sales through leading value-added resellers and distributors dedicated to niche applications that DiMi is capable of addressing and strategic marketing and integration collaborations with industry leading system integrators, original equipment manufacturers and large cellular carriers and dealers.   Necessity is indeed the mother of invention. Being a New York City property manager tied Fata down, but he still desperately wanted and needed to travel to race cars for Ferrari in the North American Challenge Series. So he designed his DiMi to enable him to remotely access, control and monitor any aspect of his private houses as well as seven of the commercial buildings his family owns in Manhattan from his iPhone, BlackBerry, desktop computer or laptop computer. Then he couldn't stop what he started. In 2002, he hired programmers to write the code for DiMi. Since then, he has spent over $6 million in the development of DiMi 1.0, DiMi 2.0, DiMi 3.0 and the installation of sensors in seven of his buildings in East Harlem and some of the family's residential properties.   In order to start getting the word out on DiMi, Fata spent more than half-a-million dollars to be part of a large trade show at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City for home building and property management technologies. As a result of participating DiMi continues to receive interest for its technology from commercial and residential property managers in Chicago , California and around the U.S. and also from abroad including Dubai and Moscow.   Remote control and monitoring of one's property or assets is an area that is experiencing explosive growth within the M2M global market. That is why it is an area of significant emphasis for DiMi. By using M2M communications, a building of nearly any size can have its lighting, air conditioning, heating and access systems remotely monitored and controlled by management, or a designated user, from virtually anywhere in the world using a device as simple as a smartphone. In fact, when Fata first installed DiMi in several of his properties in mid-2003, he began to see significant annual cost and energy savings. The following two examples illustrate how much cash and energy Fata was able to save just from the initial installation:   * In two of Fata's properties, room temperature sensors were installed to identify specific heat load loss and window position sensors were installed to identify open windows. He also replaced heat timers with demand-based heating. As a consequence of DiMi's remote monitoring and control capabilities, oil consumption dropped by up to 65% in the first year, resulting in annual cost savings of $15,000 per building. "In one building we learned we were baking the tenants," Roberto Fata recalls. "The average temperature in one building was 96 degrees in the winter of 2004. Everyone had their windows open. With the help of sensors we adjusted the temperature. All the windows closed and our heating costs normalized."   * It is general practice (and often required by city code) to install drip pans wherever water, condensation or moisture build-up may collect in a building. Overlooked water overflows from these drip pans routinely caused damage to lower floors and tenant spaces, costing the Fata Organization an estimated $16,000 per year per building for repairs and rent "interruption compensation" paid to inconvenienced tenants. To combat this, water sensors were installed in all drip pan and surrounding areas. In the event of a water leak, DiMialerted the building superintendent through his smartphone, who then immediately reacted by emptying the drip pan before damages occurred. Aside from the cost saving benefits, the Fata saw improved tenant satisfaction and annual retention rates increased.   Fata claims that there isn't any technology on the market today that can integrate the three most widely used monitoring systems in smart buildings: BACnet, LonTalk and Smart-BUS. He plans to change that. "We are developing an app that will allow us to speak to the Smart-BUS world, the BACnet world and the LonTalk world," he says. "Right there, that is 90% of automation. So we can walk into almost any existing facility and plug into say the BACnet module and read everything that is already connected and programmed in their system and populate the DiMi server up in the cloud. Now that the end user will have the ability to create rules, create custom reports as to what they want to see. Today, they're limited by their present system."   Once all of the systems and data are integrated in the cloud the property owner, manager, or designated end user will have around the clock access to all of the information and be able to remotely control all of the systems from anywhere in the world on an online command and control dashboard through the secure DiMi internet portal.   In New York new legislation will go into effect August 1, which Fata believes will create a great marketing opportunity for the DiMi system right in his own backyard. Any commercial building in New York with over 50,000 square feet of space will be required to have some kind of smart technology to monitor efficiencies such as water and electricity and to report that data to the city government. "Right now, there are 125,000 commercial buildings on the Island of Manhattan alone," he says. "How's that for opportunity?"   A management team with a strong background in commercial and residential property management       Barry Tenzer, 79, who is co-founder, president and CEO, has more than 50 years hands-on experience founding, managing and/or serving as a board member of numerous private and public companies operating in a broad range of industries, including real estate, property management, construction, legal services, commercial packaging, cemetery, auto sales and chartered aviation services, just to name a few. He was General Partner of 527 Madison Avenue Company NY, LP, and No. 34th St. Company, L.P., and Limited Partner in approximately 20 real estate investments. As CEO of HIG Corporation, he owned and operated six cemeteries in Maryland, Virginia and Florida. Tenzer also founded and served as president and CEO of Motorcars Auto Group, Inc., a company engaged in the ownership and operation of exotic, high performance car dealerships and auto accessory businesses.   A veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Tenzer graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree and earned a law degree (LLB) from New York University. He was admitted to the New York Bar Association in 1957 and practiced law at the prominent New York-based Tenzer, Greenblatt P.A., where his father, Congressman Herbert Tenzer, was a founding partner. Tenzer's real estate contacts should be invaluable to open doors for new sales.   Roberto Fata, 43, is co-founder and executive vice president of business development. Since 1991, Fata has risen through the ranks of the family business:  Fata Organization, a New York City-based real estate company that has owned and managed commercial and residential properties in Manhattan for over 70 years.  As the firm's president, he has played a leadership role in the revitalization of Harlem, Manhattan's most famous neighborhood, and currently serves on the board of directors for both the Greater Harlem Board of Realtors and the 125th Street Business Improvement District.   In 2006, he founded DiMi PA, Inc. to commercialize DiMiSpeaks, a facility management software and hosting solution that he developed to better manage the many building operating systems that supported all of the Fata Organization's real estate properties.  In 2010, Fata sold the assets of DiMi PA to DiMi Telematics and is currently providing counsel and oversight to the company's management team as it prepares to take the DiMi M2M communications solution to market in the first quarter of 2013.   Fata earned bachelor degrees in both Real Estate and Finance from the University of Miami. He completed the Negotiations program at Harvard University - John F. Kennedy School of Government.  In 2008, he was named the Ferrari Challenge Champion of the North American race series.   Lyle Hauser, 41, is co-founder and the largest shareholder of DiMi. He is not an officer or director but serves as an advisor to management on business development. Hauser is chairman and CEO of Vantage Group Ltd., a private equity firm with a specialized business consultancy serving early stage companies. Vantage Group's primary investment strategy is focused on providing capital and professional managerial guidance to select high growth companies in a broad range of industries. Since 1994, Hauser has advised and consulted many private and public companies on capital structure, debt financing, mergers and acquisitions, capital formation and reverse merger transactions.   Finance   As a development stage software start-up, DiMi Telematics International has not generated any revenue and as a start-up shares all the upside potential and downside perils of being a new company. With net working capital of nearly $1million and no debt, DiMi has sufficient cash to complete the upgrade of DiMi 4.0 technology, which is estimated to cost $580,000.   As of February 29, 2012, DiMi had cash and cash equivalents of $950,695 and a net working capital of $938,047. DiMi boasts a very low internal cash burn and can be considered to be in what venture capitalists call "the incubator period." For example, none of the executive officers currently receives a salary from the company. They all work for equity. And since DiMi is based in one of the Fata family's Manhattan locations there is no office rent specifically associated with the day-to-day operations of DiMi.   Naturally after the prototype passes muster, DiMi will need to raise more capital as it ramps up to go commercial in the first quarter of 2013. This will require a major funding effort to raise as much as $5 million.   After its second recent 2 for 1 forward stock split total shares outstanding now are around 327 million, adjusted for a give back to the company treasury to be retired of 100 million shares by co-founder Lyle Hauser on June 14, 2012. In exchange DiMi issue Hauser 1,000 shares of preferred stock which will be returned to DiMi at the option of Hauser. The consideration would be 100 million common shares if DiMi's earnings per share for its fiscal year ended August 31, 2013 are less than $0.01 and no consideration if DiMi earnings are higher. This important share give back resulted in a reduction in shares outstanding of 23%.   Commenting Barry Tenzer, President and CEO of DiMi, stated, "The exchange and retirement of these common shares is viewed by our management team as a very positive step toward improving our Company's overall capital structure and enhancing value for both our new and existing shareholders. Moreover, Lyle's decision to enter into this share exchange represents a much-appreciated vote of confidence in DiMi's exciting business plan and positions us well to implement our strategic growth initiatives in 2012 and beyond."   Trading in May and June was only a few thousand shares but it exploded on June 14 to 5.1 million shares. On that volatile day the stock price of DiMi ranged between a high of $1.12 to a low of $0.53 and closed at $0.835. At the close of June 14th and adjusting shares outstanding for the 100 million share give back to 327.7 million, total stock market capitalization is $274 million. The float is about 27 million shares.   History   In the winter of 2004, Roberto Fata succeeded in making his then 80-year-old father, Eugene Fata, then head of the Fata Organization, a believer in technologies Gene really did not understand such as sensors and computers.   A delightful New York Times story of October 19, 2010 "A landlord learns from his son" described how Roberto showed his father that by installing sensors in each of his properties he no longer had to go from building to building with a piece of paper and pencil in order to monitor his each one. He could monitor his properties remotely by using a computer or mobile phone. That year, Roberto installed water sensors to show when toilets were backing up, temperature sensors in every living room and oil sensors to provide evidence if a delivery was 200 gallons short.   Roberto, who discovered that he had a talent for tinkering with things when he was a child, saw the enormous cost-savings potential that could be generated by the sensors that he developed a web-based system around the sensors and called it DiMi. "Dimmi" means "tell me" in Italian. He developed the DiMi solution so that it's able to capture and integrate real-time data from virtually all of the standard networked control systems, sensors and devices.   The DiMi solution is now actively monitoring property management systems in seven of Fata's commercial and residential buildings in East Harlem, NY - all beta sites which have served to successfully prove the technology and M2M communications platform. Fata family private residences elsewhere are also being monitored with good results.   Recognizing the enormous global market potential for DiMi, Fata and an old college friend, Lyle Hauser, chairman and CEO of a private equity firm Vantage Group Ltd., formed DiMi Telematics. In November 2011 the company went public by backing into a shell company First Quantum Ventures, Inc. On March 15, 2012 the entity changed its name to DiMi Telematics International, Inc. In April the company executed a forward 2 for 1 stock split and trading commenced on the Pink Sheets under the symbol DIMI.PK. In May DiMi executed a second 2 for 1 forward stock split to increase the float to 27 million shares. On June 14th as we go to press Lyle Hauser returned 100 million of his founder's shares to the company treasury reducing estimated shares outstanding to around 327 million. See Finance section for a description of this transaction.   Currently, the DiMi product and software is being styled to go commercial in the first quarter of 2013 when DiMi will shift into gear.   Competition   DiMi boasts that it is uniquely hardware indifferent. This will separate it from the crowd and enable DiMi to integrate many rival platforms on to Dimi's. Cloud-based businesses that share the M2M space can be viewed as competitors. These include M2M application service providers, mobile virtual network operators, system integrators and wireless operators/carriers that offer a variety of the components and services required for the delivery of complete M2M solutions. Also because the growth of M2M is so meteoric many new entries are sure to jump in.   Risks   As a development stage start-up DiMi faces all the perils of being new. Boasting the only cloud-based M2M software technology which can integrate the most widely used property management devices, DiMi has a great opportunity to make a substantial inroads in the commercial property management space and enhance the company's valuation. However, once the DiMi system reaches the commercial stage DiMi will have to raise perhaps as much as $5 million in order to staff up and hit the ground running. Timing is important. There's always the chance that another M2M company that's better financed and that operates in the property management space may develop its own superior cloud-based software technology. What's more, although DiMi is a proven technology in the Fata properties, the technology's real test will come when the platform goes commercial. Old Timers always warn that a new company is a concept company until outsiders buy the product, reorder or renew and the company becomes profitable.   In a start-up where a dream is being turned into a reality the future never evolves exactly as expected. The rubber really hits the road when the unexpected happens. Then management must react positively, correctly and quickly. That is what separates the legends from the rest of the pack.

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.
