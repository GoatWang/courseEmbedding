Harpoon Therapeutics Announces Completion of $45M Series B Financing




MPM Capital, Arix Bioscience, New Leaf Venture Partners and Taiho 
      Ventures Participate in Immuno-Oncology Financing 






May 25, 2017 07:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Harpoon Therapeutics, a biotechnology company developing novel T-cell 
      recruiting biologic therapies for the treatment of cancer, today 
      announced the completion of a $45M Series B financing, which included 
      Arix Bioscience, New Leaf Venture Partners and Taiho Ventures, who are 
      all new investors in the company, and existing investor MPM Capital. The 
      financing was co-led by Arix Bioscience and New Leaf Venture Partners. 
      Mark Chin, Investment Manager at Arix, and Ron Hunt, Managing Director 
      at New Leaf, will join the Harpoon Therapeutics board of directors. In 
      addition, Sakae Asanuma, President of Taiho Ventures, will join the 
      board of directors in an observer capacity.
    


      Proceeds from the financing will be used to advance Harpoon 
      Therapeutics’ novel, proprietary, tri-specific T-cell activating 
      construct (TriTAC™) immuno-oncology platform, including moving two lead 
      programs into clinical trials and expanding the product pipeline through 
      discovery and partnering initiatives. In addition, the company is 
      increasing its commitment to developing additional therapeutic platforms 
      including those that become activated by proteases present in the tumor 
      microenvironment.
    

      “We are delighted to have top-tier investors supporting the Series B 
      financing, and welcome new investors as Harpoon shareholders,” said 
      Jerry McMahon, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Harpoon 
      Therapeutics. “This investment is a clear validation of Harpoon’s 
      TriTAC™ platform, which offers a new way to unleash the targeted 
      cell-killing properties of a patient’s own immune system with a 
      potential best-in-class T-cell engager platform.”
    

      “We have been strong advocates of Harpoon Therapeutics from inception, 
      and are pleased to participate in this latest round of financing, which 
      provides capital to transition Harpoon to a clinical-stage company as 
      well as to advance critical discovery and research efforts,” said Luke 
      Evnin, PhD, Co-Founder and Chairman of Harpoon, and Founder and Managing 
      Director at MPM Capital.
    

      “Harpoon Therapeutics has a novel, T-cell engager platform which we 
      believe will be instrumental to the discovery and development of 
      important new therapeutics in oncology,” said Mark Chin, Investment 
      Manager at Arix Bioscience, a global healthcare and life science company 
      supporting medical innovation. “Coupled with its scientific expertise 
      and strong management team, Harpoon is well-positioned to play a leading 
      role in the immuno-oncology field.”
    

      “New Leaf looks for experienced management teams, strong science and 
      high-impact clinical benefit potential, all of which Harpoon 
      Therapeutics significantly offers,” said Ron Hunt, Managing Director at 
      New Leaf Venture Partners, a leader in healthcare investing. “We are 
      pleased to be co-leading this Harpoon investment with Arix and look 
      forward to helping the company make important strides as it continues to 
      advance its pipeline.”
    

      Harpoon’s first clinical candidate, HPN424, is a prostate-specific 
      membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting TriTAC™. HPN424 is in development for 
      the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and is expected to enter 
      Phase 1 clinical trials in 2018. The company anticipates identifying and 
      moving into development additional clinical candidates within the next 
      year.
    

About Harpoon Therapeutics — Harpoon Therapeutics is an 
      immuno-oncology company founded by Patrick Baeuerle, PhD, a pioneer in 
      the development of T-cell engaging therapies, and MPM Capital. The 
      company is focused on the discovery and development of novel T-cell 
      engaging biologics for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. 
      Harpoon Therapeutics created a novel antibody-based drug discovery 
      platform called TriTAC™ (tri-specific T-cell activating construct) to 
      unleash the targeted cell-killing properties of a patient’s own immune 
      system through T-cell activation. This approach has been optimized to 
      penetrate tissues and extend serum exposure, and has the potential to 
      address a broad range of cancers, including solid tumors, and 
      immunologic diseases. HPN424, a prostate-specific membrane antigen 
      (PSMA)-targeting TriTAC™ biologic, is in development for the treatment 
      of prostate cancer and is expected to enter a clinical trial in 2018.
