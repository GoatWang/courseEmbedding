Geeking Out at Amazon - MIT Technology Review























































Geeking Out at Amazon
Jeff Wilke, SM ‘93, is genuinely passionate about the art–and science–of keeping customers happy.


					by 
Gigi Marino

October 15, 2007




















Talk to Jeff Wilke, SM ‘93, for five minutes about his eight-year career at Amazon.com, and you will feel as if you have met Earth’s biggest talking billboard. “The beauty of our model is that we want to give our consumers whatever they want,” he might say. “When the technology changes, we also will give consumers what they want.” Ask if it surprises him that your last purchase from the Internet retailer was not a book, DVD, or CD but a solar-powered bird bath, and his response will be, “First, just let me say, ‘Thank you.’” This is a man who will tell you with a straight face that he sometimes wakes up in a cold sweat “worried about the customer experience we’re creating.” His demeanor does not shout “salesman,” though he may work a subtle pitch for Amazon Prime, which offers unlimited free shipping for $79 a year, into the conversation. He is a man who uses the first person plural when he talks about his work, his earnestness almost palpable when he insists, “We want to be, and think we are, among Earth’s most customer-centric companies.” It’s no stretch to imagine the mantra “There is no ‘I’ in ‘team’ ” running like a news ticker around his frontal lobe.





Wilke, who came to Amazon in 1999 as vice president and general manager of worldwide operations, is now the company’s senior vice president of North American retail. It’s not hard to imagine the boyish 40-year-old as a grown-up Harry Potter–and he is indeed a bit of a wizard, says Erik ­Brynjolfsson, PhD ‘91, director of MIT’s Center for Digital Business. When Wilke first visited the now-defunct Seattle distribution center eight years ago, all he saw was chaos. “There were people, product, carts with product, moving randomly about all over the place,” he says. “Too much hustle and bustle. I thought it was under­automated, chaotic, not enough focus on safety.” But he made that chaos disappear.
Brynjolfsson credits Wilke with being the behind-the-scenes guy largely responsible for streamlining Amazon’s operations, an achievement that helped propel the company’s annual sales from $1 billion in 1999 to an estimated $14 billion today. “A huge part of Amazon’s success is the logistics, and Jeff was the secret ingredient behind that,” ­Brynjolfsson says: in focusing on getting goods to customers efficiently and inexpensively, Wilke took the model to a new level, dealing with a new set of issues and an unprecedented scale. “He figured out the logistics puzzle almost like it was a manufacturing problem,” Brynjolfsson says. “Jeff Wilke is recognized as the whiz at pulling together multiple components and delivering them on time in as few shipments as possible.”
Brynjolfsson will also tell you that Wilke is “very generous with time, both in terms of research and teaching.” Wilke, who earned a master’s in chemical engineering and a master’s in management through the Institute’s Leaders for Manufacturing (LFM) program, tries to come back to MIT to work with students each year. Brynjolfsson recalls a moment in the classroom when a student asked a question about operations research, and Wilke, who says that he’s a “fan of mathematics,” launched into a long, complicated, quantitative answer. Eventually, he caught himself and apologized for being such “a nerd,” pressing his spread thumb and forefinger to his forehead in the time-honored “loser” symbol. “But the reality,” Brynjolfsson says, “is that every student in that room wanted to be just like him, working at one of the coolest Internet companies in the world.”
“I probably skew toward the nerd side,” Wilke readily admits. “People usually geek out on something in their life. For some people, it’s beer, or music, or football, and for other people, it’s direct-to-consumer fulfillment. I happen to like beer, music, football, and direct-to-consumer fulfillment. If I am going to geek out, I’m proud to be at a company that is filled with nerds.”
It was “with the eye of an operations nerd” that Wilke says he went after the chaos in Amazon’s distribution center. He adds, “To be clear, LFM graduates operations nerds, no question. Those nerds think operations is cool, too. I approached it in a pretty systematic way. It’s the way I’ve thought about assembly and manufacturing processes for the last 16 years. LFM is the place that gave me the playbook.”
Part of Wilke’s systematic approach was to make road trips to different fulfillment centers, sometimes rolling up his sleeves and wrangling merchandise himself. When he was in charge of worldwide operations, he and Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s president and CEO, spent a week each year visiting different sites to help devise ways to speed up the process of filling and delivering orders.
One Christmas season a few years after Wilke joined Amazon, the two Jeffs traveled to Kentucky, where they helped pack folding chairs into cardboard boxes that took 20 minutes each to assemble. Wilke says, “After we made three or four of them, we asked the associates on the floor if this is what they did for each one of the chairs, and they said, ‘Yes, it’s pretty stupid, isn’t it?’ We came back and launched a program called ‘Get the CRAP out.’” Getting the CRAP (which stands for “can’t realize any profit”) out of Amazon’s inventory meant looking at all the items that weren’t making any money; if the company couldn’t figure out how to change the process to make an item profitable, it got rid of the item. “With the case of the chairs,” Wilke recalls, “the vendor came back and said, ‘Of course we can package the product in a preconstructed cardboard box that will meet your needs.’ Hence, the problem went away.”
The Christmas season is by far the busiest for the Internet retailer, and something it plans for year round. According to Wilke, on the peak day in 2006, Amazon shipped more than 3.4 million units worldwide–an average of more than 140,000 items per hour. “We’ve gotten to the size now,” he says, “that we actually influence the air capacity for freight around the world.” He remembers one year getting a call at midnight on the 22nd of December from Amazon’s head of transportation, who wanted approval to rent a jumbo jet to fly all the orders waiting at the fulfillment center in Reno to the Louisville distribution center for UPS pickup. “We found a 747 somewhere in the California desert,” he says, “and got all those packages delivered by Christmas.”
The last week before Christmas at Amazon is like “having your family over for the holidays–always crazy and boisterous,” Wilke says. “You’re tired, but there’s also a lot of adrenaline, excitement, passion, and pride.” On the last shipping day before the holiday, he says, workers in the warehouse invariably find that the last items needed to fill some orders are broken. “What we’ve done is send a small team of people to the mall to buy items,” he says. “For those few customers, it could make the difference between having a perfect Christmas and not.” Wilke has noticed that people are waiting later and later to finish their shopping each year. “We’ve trained customers to wait until the last minute, and that it’s okay,” he says. “It becomes a foundation for trust, and it’s hard to imitate.”
In his new position at the company, Wilke focuses on pricing, merchandising, buying, and marketing. Now, he’s weighing whether Amazon’s prices are low enough. “Can the consumer go to the Web and find a better price and say that Amazon is not competitive and go somewhere else?” he says. “We use every means at our disposal to understand how the marketplace is competitive.” When asked if he was responsible for the recent price slashing at Amazon, he insists, “It’s not me, it’s us. The management team and the company decided several years ago that we were going to focus on low prices. I participated with my peers in making that decision. Now it’s my turn to execute it.”
He’s also intent on executing Amazon’s North American retail-marketing strategy, which in 2007 included a push to promote Amazon Prime. After multiple interviews for this story, Wilke learned that he had convinced an initially reluctant reporter to purchase the service. “Ding! Ding! Ding!” he cried. “Are you addicted to it?” Upon hearing that the lure of free shipping had already steered several sales Amazon’s way, he responded like a reassuring coach. “Good,” he said. “It’s okay. It’s just like rappelling. At some point, you have to let go of the rope, just let go. You’re getting a low price and great product, and you’re getting it in two days. It works.” 
That unwavering conviction and sincerity may well be the magic behind Wilke’s operational wizardry.

Blow Away Your Competition by Replacing Your Old CRM Program with the New Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM) Model – Part 2: The Necessary Components.


March 18, 2012
4 Comments






1) Introduction:

In my previous blog, I covered what the new Customer Relevant Relationship Model (CRRM) is and the benefits of adopting this new model. In this blog, I will cover the components of the new CRRM model and what you need to put in place to make this new model a reality.


Ever wonder why companies like ESPN, Apple, Google, Zynga, Amazon, and Marriott dominate their respective markets? The reason is that they are ‘Customer First’ organizations and are passionate about listening to, understanding and then delighting their customers based on leveraging true customer insights. They treat their customers as business partners vs. commodities and include them in many critical decision making processes. They get this new CRRM model. Why/how ? – Read the rest of this blog to find out…


The differences between the old CRM model and how these companies are embracing the newer CRRM model are depicted in the following chart:

The Old CRM Model vs. New CRRM Model – Customers as Business Partners
2) Customers are fed up with old Dictatorial Management Style & Want to be Empowered as Business Partners
Customers and stakeholders today are longing for a company to partner with them and include them in the corporate decision making process.  These same constituencies are sick and tired of political, corporate, and other organizations making unilateral decisions for them that are really not in-line with their needs,  wants, etc. The backlash from this unwanted dictatorial management style of some companies can be seen in the Bank of America fee customer rebellion, the customer backlash from Netflix deciding to  split their company without first consulting with their customers and HPs initial decision to exit the computer market.
3) Components of the New CRRM Model:
In order to progress your organization from the old CRM model to the new CRRM  model, a few key essentials must be put in place and are as follows:
A. New CRRM Model that includes the 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights.  This model enables a 360° view of all customer and market insights including customer feedback, preferences, likes, dislikes, social sentiment, competitor activity, etc. This new model takes your insights to an entirely new level whereby you are now enabled to delight customers, stakeholders and stockholders by having insights that are light-years ahead of insights provided by a traditional CRM model.

B. Customer First Culture driven by management that is passionate about their customers including a set of customer first principles and guidelines developed by company leaders

C. Customer Ratings & Feedback Structure that will identify areas where you will collect customer 360° feedback from customer and stakeholder interactions

D. Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process and corresponding infrastructure in order to allow your customers to continually rate how well you are serving them

E. Customer Health Scorecard that provides real-time insights on how well the customers, stakeholders and stockholders perceives you as serving them as well as insights into a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that enables you to continually improve your customer perceptions, satisfaction, brand loyalty, etc.
These components can apply to large enterprises as well as Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs).
The following graphics are all sample components from the list above (A-D) that need to be put in place to enable this new CRRM Model.


New CRRM Model – 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights


 3A) The above chart “New CRRM Model – 360 Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights” demonstrates the new insights model that must be put in place to deliver world-class stakeholder and customer programs. 
These enhanced insights will enable you to deliver products and services that delight your customers, stakeholders and stockholders as well as enable you to leapfrog the competition in terms of market share if they continue to rely on their antiquated CRM data and analytics insights only model.  
For Small to Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), some of the insights do not apply, but the following charts (3B-3E) most certainly apply and can be tracked via simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.



CRRM Customer First Policies & Organizational Principles
3B) The above chart “CRRM Organizational Guiding Principles” demonstrates the principles that must be in-place to be customer first culture. This culture is driven by management that is passionate about their customers and governs the company around a set of customer first policies.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure
3C) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure” illustrates a sample structure (will vary for each type of business) whereby customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Enterprise CRRM Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process
3D) The above chart “CRRM Customer Ratings & Feedback Cultivation Process” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization
3E) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be visually represented in a scorecard. 
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Metrics
3E-2) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be rolled up into an analytical scorecard that provides insights into customer trends,  customer feedback, customer issues, core customer strengths and weaknesses, etc. 
This scorecard can also be used to manage a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that continually drives improvements to customer perceptions, ratings, satisfaction, etc. 
Sample Scorecard for “Shopping Experience”
The above depicts how analytics and metrics would be maintained for a business who had a retail or wholesale shopping function.
Sample Shopping Experience Scorecard – #2
Robust Scorecard Analytics and Metrics should support Customer Trend Identification and Root Cause Analysis for Customer Issues.
Sample Branding & Public Relations Scorecard
Sample Public Relations Scorecard Above gives you insights into how well your company and brands are perceived by customers, stakeholders, stockholders, etc. 
Sample Customer Service Scorecard
Sample Customer Scorecard Above from Customer Service tells how well you are serving your customers.
Sample Marketing Scorecard
Sample Marketing Scorecard Above Gives you insights into how well your Marketing Efforts are resonating with your customers.
Sample Product Management Scorecard
The Sample Product Management Scorecard above gives you insights into how well perceived your products and services are with customers and prospects.
4) Company & Customer Benefits of Adopting the CRRM Model:
By treating customers as business partners (vs. commodities) and including them in the corporate decision making process, as well as allowing them to rate how well you are serving them from an array of customer facing areas, companies can reap huge rewards including the following:
1. Better insights into the types of products and services customers want & need
2. Fiercely loyal customers who feel part of the corporate team
3. Customers who are most likely to spend more, be retained longer and purchase at premium prices with higher profit margins
4. Customers who are very likely to be brand advocates and refer others to your company, brands, and services.
5. Customers who feel connected to the company and empowered to improve company operations
The following are actual customer comments from those who have participated in a customer feedback program to help shape products & services:
“I feel like xyz company cares about me since they ask my opinion”
“Finally a company that listens to us”
“It is so refreshing to have a company ask you your opinions on products and services vs. ramming something down our throats that we don’t like”
“Wow – this is fun. I enjoy providing my opinion”
“As silly as this might sound, xyz company is the only company that ever asked me what I wanted”
“In my opinion, xyz company is much more progressive than their competitors by seeking consumer opinions, what matters to them, etc. 
 5) Conclusion:
More dynamic companies like Goodle, Zynga, Amazon, etc. are inviting customers to become part of the corporate decision making process and empowering them to provide feedback, insights and rate company operations in order to drive continous customer improvements. Companies who adopt this new CRRM model whereby company management is democratized by including stakeholders and customers into the decision making process will reap the rewards of ever higher customer acquisition, retention and spend – leading to ever higher profits and share price.
