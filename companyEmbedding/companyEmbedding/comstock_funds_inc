Why EVERY High Net Worth Investor Should Consider Selling Commodities Options













If you currently limit your asset mix to traditional investments, even if you write stock options, you’re missing out on what could be a powerful tool for growing and protecting your net worth.


…selling options was, in my opinion and not without risk, the single most productive approach I’d ever found to build equity in an account.




James Cordier, Founder







TOP 10 Reasons Why Every High Net Worth Investor Should Consider Selling Options








1. Powerful and Complete Diversification: Enjoy the relief that comes from finally getting properly diversified by owning a portfolio that is uncorrelated to everything – including the commodities indexes. You’ll no longer have to rely so heavily on the direction of the stock market for growing wealth for you and your heirs.


READ MOREClose


Discover Real Diversification


A commodity option selling portfolio offers a true diversifier – a freedom that is rare in the financial markets. Option Selling can be the key to the chains that bind you to your overweighted stock portfolio. Now you may argue that either 

a. I already own commodities in my portfolio… -or-
b. Commodities sometimes track the stock market – they’re not that diversified

Both of these statements could be true. And they would also both be irrelevant. For a commodities option selling portfolio can be totally uncorrolated to anything else, even the commodity indexes themselves. Why?






Two reasons.

1.Because commodities markets are much less correlated to each other than are stocks. For instance, if you buy shares of Exxon, Apple and Caterpillar and the DOW tanks, chances are your share values are all going down, regardless of how “good” they are. The are all stocks and there are many macro-economic factors that affect all stock prices. To commodity traders, “stocks” are simply one of many futures contracts. On the other hand, if you own contracts of natural gas, silver and soybeans, those are three widely different products with very different fundamentals that affect their price. The price of one has little to do with the price of the other. That gives you broad diversification. But that’s not the biggest reason.
2.Because as an option seller, you can sell puts and/or calls. That means that in addition to having positions in a variety of unrelated markets, you can be long, short or neutral – or all at the same time! As an option seller, you often don’t care what way the market is moving on a net basis. Your only concern is that it does not move sharply against your position in a short period of time. A macro economic event that tanks stocks or moves commodities indexes can be good, bad or neutral to your position as an option seller. An oil shock can have little effect on your position in coffee. Make sense?










2. Potential for outsize growth and/or income:  Option Selling Portfolios can produce 10-20 even 30%+ returns over the longer term making them a potentially high octane tool for wealth generation.


READ MOREClose


The Potential for Outsized Returns

If you are purely seeking an investment with some horsepower, this could be reason #1 for you. For while option selling can be “slow and boring” for the action oriented trader, the accumulated premiums and leverage of the futures markets can make them anything but. Stock option sellers take note: This ain’t selling covered calls on your Microsoft. This is option selling on steroids.
If you sell a stock option and take a $200 premium, you are generally paying 10 to 20 times that amount in margin to hold that position. In commodities options, you can sell options for


a. Much Higher premiums (we target $500 to $700 each)
b. Much Lower Margins (generally 1 ½ to 2 times the premium)

Thus a margin for a $500 option premium may only require a $750 to $1,000 margin requirement from you. We’ll let you do the math.





Suffice to say, if you get satisfaction from targeting potentially high ROI on your investments and are comfortable with a certain degree of risk, option selling on commodities could be a good choice for you.
Using commodities leverage to your advantage is covered thoroughly in our book The Complete Guide to Option Selling (3rd Edition) on sale in fine bookstores or here now. 










3. The Ability to be profitable in nearly ANY kind of market, economic or interest rate environment.


READ MOREClose


Can be Effective in Nearly Any Kind of Market
A major benefit of option selling (and one that makes if a favorite of the high net worth crowd) is that it can be effective in nearly any kind of market conditions. As covered above, this is especially true in commodities, where individual markets tend to move somewhat independently of each other. 

If you have a big chunk of your cash in stocks, it’s all good until you hit a market correction, a wave of volatility on some economic or geopolitical event, or an outright bear market. 
As an option seller, especially a commodities option seller, you have the ability to be successful in these kinds of markets.Option writing can be profitable in bull, bear or listless markets. Market volatility? Great! Volatile markets are the BEST markets in which to be an option writer. It was Buffet who said to be greedy when others are fearful. While your golf buddies are complaining about the “rough waters” the market is in, you can (potentially) be sailing in a cool breeze. Remember, you’re deep out of the money – way over or way under the market. While this doesn’t make you bulletproof to all market events, it does give you a great deal of flexibility and diversity to deal with what may come along. The end result for you is the peace of mindof knowing your portfolio has the potential to produce no matter what is happening in the financial markets.












4. Consistency of Trading with the Odds now on Your Side: Tired of always hearing about Wall Street Insiders and Hedge Fund managers having the drop on individual investors? Selling options lets you level the playing field. 


READ MOREClose


Trading with the Odds

This is one of the biggest advantages of selling options. As Alan Greenspan once said: “Amateurs want to be right. Professionals want to make money.” Option sellers don’t have to be right to make money. In option selling, you give up your chance to hit “home runs” in exchange for the consistency of hitting “singles” – over and over and over again. It is estimated that 75-85% of all options held at expiration will expire worthless. By using a few simple tools – you can select options with even higher odds than this of expiring worthless. If buying options is like going to the casino, selling options is like being the casino- where the odds are tilted in your favor.
A black jack dealer in Vegas only has a tiny edge over any particular player at his table. Yet if players sit there long enough, the dealer will eventually get all of their money. This exemplifies the power of using applied odds over time. 
The fact of the matter is, you can choose options with a 90, 95 even 99% chance of expiring worthless. When is the last time you got those kinds of odds buying a stock? While risk of loss is always present, as an option seller, you gain the confidence of knowing you are now trading with the percentages. 





“The strategy of selling options is, at its core, a strategy of using applied odds over time.”




The 80% figure (rightly) grabs people’s attention. Chat room “option geniuses” may argue this figure’s relevance. But few will argue an option sellers advantage over an option buyer. The fact that most investors don’t know how to harness these odds is not your problem. Let it be theirs.
This consistency – having the majority of your trades as winners instead of losers- can be not only psychologically beneficial to you, the trader, but give you more focus to act when there is a risk measure to be employed or a new opportunity to capture. 










5. Time is now Your powerful ally:  Investing is fraught with uncertainties. But there is no greater certainty than the passage of time. As an option seller, time is your greatest ally, ticking away at the value of your option as each day passes.


READ MOREClose


Time is on your Side

When selling (or writing) an option, time value works for you instead of against you. That means that whatever else is going on in the underlying market, you enjoy the comfort of knowing that the unwavering hands of Father Time are always working in your favor. 
When you sell an option, the buyer of the option pays you a premium for that option. If you sell an out of the money option, the entire value of that option is in time value. As time passes, all other things remaining constant, the option will gradually lose its value. This is called Time Decay and it’s one of the main reasons selling options can be so effective. It is for this reason that OptionSellers.com pursues a strategy of selling deep out of the money options in client portfolios.




The closer an option gets to expiration, the faster its rate of time decay.




The graph above illustrates the principle of time decay and its acceleration as expiration draws near. An option is considered a “wasting asset.” Time value erodes as each day passes, accelerating as the option’s expiration nears. This is referred to as time-decay. If the underlying contract’s price does not move to the option’s strike price by expiration, the option will have no value left and expire worthless and the option seller will keep the premium. Of course, as in any trading, a large move in the underlying may result in a loss. This is the concept on which our entire portfolio strategy is based. Notice that the value decays the fastest during the last 30-60 days of the option’s life.









6. Every trade has an expiration date:  Whether you own a stock, a piece of real estate, or even a commodities futures contract, one of the toughest decisions you’ll ever have to make is where to take profits on a successful trade. Avoiding that gut-wrenching decision is a big benefit enjoyed by the option seller.  


READ MOREClose


No Profit Taking Decisions

You have a profit on your trade? Now what? Do you take the money off the table now and risk that your about to miss out on an even bigger move? Or do you “let it ride” and risk the profit you’ve already made? 
One of the hardest parts of futures or any trading is deciding when to take profits. With option selling, if the market behaves favorably towards your position, you are relieved from the responsibility of making this decision. As time value decays your option, the market will gradually take profits for you. 
Upon expiration, if the option is still out of the money (has not reached your strike price), the entire premium for which you sold the option will be in your account. At this time, your position automatically closes out. 






However, you reserve the right to close out your short option position at any time prior to expiration as well – either as a loss limiting measure, or as a profit taking move. It’s a personal choice. In regard to taking a profit, some of the investors we’ve worked with find that it can be easier and require less effort to simply let the market “do it for them.”
Of course no “safe” trading system has ever been devised and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss.










7. Ease of low maintenence:  Unlike a stock option selling account, if you sell options in the manner described on this website, you won’t need to be by a computer screen all day. 


READ MOREClose


Low Maintenance Account

Deep out of the money options tend to move slowly and do not require minute by minute maintenance. That being said, this isn’t a sell it and forget it strategy either. Your positions will need some adjustments from time to time. Many high net worth investors choose to remove themselves from the trading equation entirely, instead hiring a professional to handle the day to day trading and position management for them. Now that’s low maintenance!











8. Security of investing in hard commodities:  Commodities, unlike stocks, will always have a value.

Investing in Real Products that will Always Hold Value – Not a piece of paper.**
2008 may seem like a long time ago. But investors that watched their net worth melt away through that market collapse took a key lesson away from it – At the end of the day, shares of stock are merely a piece of paper. If you really want to drive that lesson home, look up a little blip in the stock market that took place in 1929. 
We all remember 9/11. Remember Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns? How about Enron? On the days and weeks any of those events occurred, when companies and paper became worthless, (or perceived to be worthless), people still woke up and ate their corn flakes and drank their orange juice. They still put gasoline in their cars and drove to work, where they drank their coffee and ate their chocolate doughnut made with wheat, sugar and cocoa. And to comfort themselves, they went home to their nice warm natural gas heated home, got out a pound of ground beef (raised on USDA approved soybean meal) for dinner and retired to their den. Here they retrieved their gold and silver coins they had hidden in the safe and counted them to comfort themselves in the moment. Why? Because they had value. And they feared when they turned on their computer screen tomorrow, all of that paper they had their money in would not. 


“Sugar can’t go bankrupt. Soybeans can’t go out of business.”
Does this mean the commodities are always a better investment than stocks? Not at all. One is not necessarily superior to the other. Are we suggesting that stocks are more dangerous or “risky” than commodities? Of course not. 
What it does mean is that no matter what goes on in the world, commodities, such as the ones listed above, will always have some kind of demand. And where there is demand there will always be value. It may not always be the same value. But a value nonetheless. A pound of sugar will always be worth something to someone. Same for a barrel of oil or a bushel of wheat. 
As a high net worth investor, you are likely already aware of the crucial practice of diversifying your assets. With commodities, you gain an extra feeling of security in knowing you have a component of your assets in investments you can hold in your hand –a lump of silver, a gallon of gas, a bushel of corn – things you can touch, feel, use. No matter what happens in the world, it remains likely that Americans are still going to want breakfast in the morning and dinner at night, fill up the gas tank, stay warm or cool, and feel “safe” with some precious metal in the closet. The same cannot be said for pieces of paper that have names like “Enron” or “Lehman” printed on them.





“Sugar can’t go bankrupt. Soybeans can’t go out of business. Commodities will always have a value.”











9. Relax. You don’t have to try to predict the future anymore.

No More Trying to Guess Market Direction

No matter what they say, nobody knows what any market is going to do, especially on a short-term basis. However, do enough homework, and it is sometimes possible to make a fairly accurate projection of where prices will not go on a longer term basis. By selling deep out of the money options, you avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today, tomorrow or next week. Instead you are only projecting where you think prices won’t go. For instance, if you are bullish the natural gas market, you might sell a deep out of the money put option. In this case, the market can move up, stay the same or even move down, as long as it is above your strike price upon expiration, you will still take your full profit.
As an Option Seller, you accept the fact that you cannot predict the future. You free yourself from the “need” for the market to move in a particular direction. You are satisfied to simply “bet” against the unlikely events and then take a payment for your efforts – over and over again. While there is still risk in this strategy, you have the ability to profit regardless of which direction the market is moving, or even if it does not move at all. And you relieve yourself of the stress that comes from trying to accomplish the nearly impossible. 
At the same time, you’ll also free yourself from the requirement of having perfect timing. When buying a stock or futures contract, when you enter your position is just as important as what you are buying. In selling deep out of the money options, the option values typically aren’t moving as quickly as the underlying stock or commodity. The fact that they are deep out of the money can mean that daily fluctuations in the underlying market may not have a large impact on the price of the option. Thus your timing becomes less important. 
Although all futures trading carries some degree of risk, done correctly, option selling can place your position in the market far enough away that short term swings in the market may not dramatically affect your position. This not only gives you staying power but allows you to focus on longer term market fundamentals. Relief from this decision means lower stress for you.





“Avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today, tomorrow or next week. The purpose of analyzing a market now simply becomes a practice of picking a far away point where it won’t go.”










10. Efficiency in keeping more of what you earn:  Option Selling is a tax-friendly strategy.

10. The Option Sellers Tax Advantage

If you think you pay your “fair share” and then some, commodity option selling could be the right strategy for you. Profits on option selling are taxed on the “60/40” rule – 40% as short term capital gains but 60% at the same rate as dividends. This makes them a favorable investment for those in high tax brackets. 
In addition, your end of year taxes on your commodity option selling account are surprisingly simple. You get a straight 1099 (profit/loss) statement and you pay your taxes based on that one figure. No more reconciling each and every trade for the year.This aspect makes the investment both simple to account for and tax efficient.











The Downside of Option Selling
There is, of course, no perfect investment. Like any other form of wealth generation, option selling has its risks and drawbacks. The two main ones are these:

It can be slow and boring: If you’re into active trading and the daily action of the markets – selling options in the manner prescribed here is not for you. Sure, there will be days where some sort of activity is required. However, for the most part, selling deep out of the money commodities options holds all of the excitement of watching paint dry – at least over the short term.
Fat tail risk: There is, of course, risk in selling options – even deep out of the money options. While the risk of your options ever going in the money (using the method we prescribe) is remote, your primary risk is that of the value of your option increasing (usually the result of a sudden and sharp move in the underlying combined with a surge in volatility) That is why experienced and diligent risk management is so critical to your performance. Contrary to popular belief, there are a few simple, yet highly effective methods of managing risk when selling options. 

That being said, in my 30+ years of professional trading experience, selling options is, in my opinion and not without risk, the single most productive approach I’ve ever found to growing long term equity in an account. 
If you are an intelligent, rational, high net worth individual who is looking for an investment approach that targets high returns with reasonable risks, has relatively high odds of success on each individual trade and requires a semi passive, lower stress type of management style, option selling could be right for you. To learn the complete strategy of option selling and how to use it in your portfolio – I recommend our third book The Complete Guide to Option Selling, 3rd Edition (McGraw Hill 2014). For a more introductory outline of the strategy, our free no obligation booklet – The Option Selling Solution will do the trick for you. If you’d like to learn more about how we can manage an option selling account for you, you’ll want to get our comprehensive Investor Discovery Pack. 
While only you can decide if this type of investing is right for you and your wealth management goals, I recommend any high net worth investor consider it as a crucial component of an overall asset mix.

As a glance at the crowded roster of Republican wannabe candidates for the presidency in next year's election makes clear, the powers that be in the GOP obviously have taken quite literally Sondheim's injunction that served as the title of the song, while the Democrats already have their very own barker and no shortage of mountebanks ensconced in their big tent.

  What Others Say

Financial Sanity3/11/13Dear Sirs,
 
         Just had to say to you thank you, thank you for your wonderful financial sanity.
 Comment on Cycle of Deflation2/15/13Hello from Ireland again (i've mailed a few years over the past). I still enjoy checking your excellent site every friday morning. One comment on the cycle of deflation - you have plant closing & debt defaults happening after competitive devaluation however this, to a large degree and in Ireland anyways, seems to have come first. Maybe you could explain this? 
Also, I have to say that even though I think you are right and will be proven so soon enough, you tend to underestimate [having read your column for ten years now I think you underestimate by a 2-4 years] the reflationary power of Central Banks and for how long they can keep them up for.  [More] Cycle of Deflation theory1/18/13I'm sure that other regular readers of your commentary have noticed the term "beggar-thy-neighbor" showing up more and more in the press and online.  It seems to validate the "cycle of deflation" theory you have posed for so long. We've been warned.  Thanks. Wonderful analysis that I have been reading for many years9/03/11I would like your permission to send a copy of your 8/25/11 market commentary to them since I agree that we are in a major credit/debt contraction of hugh scale and a good deal of the asset write-downs are ahead not behind us. irrespective of your answer I want to thank you for wonderful analysis that I have been reading for many years. Your Message is Loud & Clear8/25/11Your weekly commentary plus the weekly postings on John Hussman's site should serve as required reading for anybody trying to follow this market.

Your message (much more concise than Dr Hussman's, I have to say)is loud & clear.

Investment Philosophy & Comstock Partner Bios
  




Comstock’s approach is wide-ranging, including the analysis of specific equities, general stock market strategy, interest rates and real estate as well as long term macroeconomic themes centering on the interaction of inflation, debt, interest rates, economic growth and their effects on the stock, bond, commodity and currency markets. Comstock Partners started implementing these strategies when they began managing the Dreyfus Capital Value Fund (presently the Comstock Partners Capital Value Fund) in 1987 and launched the Comstock Partners Strategy Fund in 1988. In May of 2000 the Shareholders of Comstock Funds voted to join the Gabelli Family of Mutual Funds. Investment Style Comstock Partners, Inc. analyzes economic and financial conditions from a long-term macro-economic perspective and makes adjustments based on cyclical and shorter-term considerations. In pursuit of its goals, the firm invests in various asset classes including domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, currencies and derivatives including indices and options. For the Capital Value Fund, Comstock Partners can buy or sell short and make use of leverage in order to maximize returns under various market conditions. In effect, we believe our operation resembles a modern-day hedge fund in its scope of activities. For each of its asset classes, Comstock adheres to macro-economic themes while also utilizing a disciplined investment philosophy that attempts to remove the emotional element of investing by focusing on data that, in the past, has exhibited a correlation with an asset’s future price movement. Such data may be fundamental or technical and includes indicators relating to the economy, money and credit, valuation, price momentum and investor sentiment. While each of these indicators may provide some degree of insight into the future performance of a particular investment, Comstock believes that an appropriate combination of these tools provides the highest probability of accurate market timing and security selection. Investing, of course, inherently involves subjective judgements and there can be no assurance that Comstock’s investment approach will prove successful.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return through growth of capital and current income.

			
			
				
			
		



Diamonds in the rough
An actively managed strategy that aims to build wealth over time. The fund seeks to outperform by making early and patient investments in large companies whose true value isn't recognized by the market.

Experience our high-conviction approach


Competitive returns


A history of adding value
      Since manager inception, the fund’s Class A shares has delivered higher returns than its benchmark on a cumulative basis, 256% versus 210% and on an annualized basis, 7.49% versus 6.65%.1 



Contrarian approach


A focus on portfolio diversification through contrarian investing
      The team's high-conviction, contrarian approach is designed to uncover undervalued companies during market downturns, setting the fund apart from its benchmark, and providing portfolio diversification aiming to participate in market upswings. 



Added value with our contrarian approach for the 20-year period shown through March 31, 2017
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $56,785, beating its benchmark.





The fund returned 428% over the last 20 years1
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $52,777 beating its benchmark and peers.

            have reduced the performance. Inflection points shaded in gray include: Jan. 1, 1999, through Dec. 31, 2000 — dot.com bubble, Jan. 1, 2001, through Dec.
            31, 2002 — technology and telecommunications bubble, Jan. 1, 2008, through Dec. 31, 2008 — commodity bubble and the great recession, and Jan. 1, 2014,
            through Dec. 31, 2015 — overwhelming global macro volatility. Underweight and Overweight exposures are shown for educational and illustrative purposes only.

For standardized fund performance, visit the fund’s performance page.
Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Visit invesco.com for the most recent month end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end sales charge. If sales charges had been reflected, performance would be lower. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.
 Additional information

Diversification does not guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.
1 Sources: Invesco, FactSet Research Systems, Inc. Cumulative performance since manager inception on Aug. 31, 1999. Benchmark is the Russell 1000 Value Index. Information shown is for the fund's Class A shares at NAV. If sales charges had been included, performance would have been lower.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.

 About risk
			 


Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the
same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the
underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to
distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights
with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The
Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than
if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on
(and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including
counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that
the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay
the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative
contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require
payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the
derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying
asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater
than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund’s
returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments
may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may
be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or
price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during
which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions.
Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to
changing government regulation that could impact the Fund’s ability to use
certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the
expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more
governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed
markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be
subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than
companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement
of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change
quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets
securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in
settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund’s foreign investments may be
adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or
taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or
increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible
seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in
which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and
the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange
controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign
securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate
fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such
foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure
to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may
fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging
strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser’s judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund’s portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative,
regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the
Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund’s investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund’s shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual
stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain
other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the
financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When
markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments
held by the Fund will rise in value.
REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. Investments in real estate related
instruments may be affected by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or
technological factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of
real estate related to the Fund’s holdings. Shares of real estate related
companies, which tend to be small- and mid-cap companies, may be more
volatile and less liquid.
Sector Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a significant
amount of its assets (i.e. over 25%) in one market sector or group of related
industries. In this event, the Fund’s performance will depend to a greater
extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there
is increased risk that the Fund will lose significant value if conditions
adversely affect that sector or group of industries.

Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to
the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity
securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall
stock market.

A RECESSION COULD BE COMINGAnd Asset Bubbles Caused by Central Banks May Burst7/06/17 11:40 AM

The Wall Street Journal recently published an article by
Greg Ip entitled “Why Soaring Assets and Low Unemployment Mean It’s Time to
Start Worrying”.  While Mr. Ip stops
short of predicting a recession or its timing, he details a list of
preconditions for recession, all which exist now. These include a labor market
at full strength, frothy asset prices, tightening by central banks, and a
pervasive sense of calm, as illustrated by the very low levels of the VIX
Index.  
At the same time, the Fed, led by Janet Yellen, continues
the narrative that they will normalize interest rates while slowly reducing the
Fed balance sheet.   This follows what we
believe was an insane monetary experiment beginning with the bursting of the
“Housing Bubble” in 2008 and lasting until the present day.  The Fed would have you believe that its
policies, after helping the economy avoid an outright collapse, have helped the
economy grow at a moderate rate with low inflation.  In our view, the word moderate is a gross overstatement.  We think the better description is “anemic”,
because no recovery since the Great Depression has been as slow as this one,
even though it’s the second longest in the country’s history.
As the situation now stands, the trailing 12 month (TTM) P/E
ratio of the S&P 500 based on GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles) earnings stands at just over 24X, which is among the most expensive
in history.  A casual observer might
think, therefore, that a TTM P/E of 24X means that the stock market is
expecting growth to accelerate.  After
all, there is no shortage of television commentators and portfolio managers
that think we are on the path to an accelerating economy.  All one needs to do is tune into any of the
financial news networks to confirm that observation.
We do not agree with that assessment, and to no surprise,
neither does the bond market.  One of the
most telling indicators of what the bond market “sees” as prospects for
economic growth is the spread between 10 year and 30 year US Government
Bonds.  The steeper the slope of the
yield curve, the more the bond market sees growth, and vice versa.  So for the month ending 6/30/17 the 10 year
to 30 year spread closed at 53 basis points. 
To find a lower monthly close for that series, one has to go all the way
back to December of 2008, just as the effects of the bursting of the “Housing
Bubble” were hitting with full force.  So
while the stock market “sees” prospects for growth as strong, as evidenced by the
24X TTM P/E, the bond market is just the opposite.  Not only is the yield curve relatively flat,
but the absolute level of bond yields are also very low.  It should be also noted that an inversion in
the yield curve, should that occur, would be a clear alarm bell as it pertains
to the possibility of a recession.  In
the past, on the 12 occasions when the yield curve has been this flat,
according to Mr. Ip, it went on to invert on 10 of those occasions.
In our view, the Fed, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank
of Japan (BOJ) all recognize that the main result of the massive money printing,
and the low to negative interest rates of the last several years have done
little more than increase the value of financial assets rather than generating
solid economic growth.  We, and others,
have said as much for quite some time now. 
We also believe the central banks are “between a rock and a hard place”.
 They realize the need to not burst the
“bubble”, but on the other hand, they do not want to negatively affect the
already anemic economic growth rates of their respective economies.  So the Fed continues on the path to
“normalization”, speaking of one more rate increase this year and three each in
2018 and 2019.  We agree with the Fed
Funds market, which is calling the Fed’s bluff. 
The futures market on Fed Funds is priced for one increase this year and
only one each in the next two.  
The Fed is, of course, fully aware of the fact that of the
thirteen tightening cycles since the Great Depression, ten of those were
followed by recession.   So the odds are
not good, as we see them.  We think the
bond market will prove to be right and the stock market will prove to be
wrong.  As we have written in the past,
the economy is swimming against a stream of rising debt, unfunded federal,
state and local liabilities, low productivity growth, and negative labor force
demographics.  At the same time, the
booming stock market has been partially fueled both by stock buybacks (that
strip equity from shareholders, as in the money stock options are exercised by
corporate managements) and “yield chasing” by return starved investors around
the world.  
Whether the Fed tightens aggressively,or not, remains to be
seen.  But in our view the damage has
already been done by its policies and those of the other major central
banks.  Years of artificially low
interest rates have resulted in mal investment and asset bubbles. When the
market does start down in earnest, our view is that the move will be large and rapid.  We believe it will then take considerable time, as in years, for the stock market to get back to highs that were achieved courtesy of "The Central Bank Bubble".

 VALUATION WILL MATTER...IT ALWAYS DOES6/01/17 5:00 PM
As the U.S.
stock market continues to make new all-time highs it may appear to many
investors that valuations no longer matter. 
We do not see it that way now, nor have we ever in the past.   We maintain our long held belief that the
U.S. stock market is extremely overpriced, relative to past earnings and future
earnings prospects.   This overpricing is
the direct result of the largest financial experiment in history, i.e., the
growth in the Fed’s balance sheet from $800bn. to $4.5tn. and the setting of
the overnight Fed Funds rate to near zero from December of 2008 to December of
2015.  Today, eighteen months after the
first rate increase in seven years, the daily effective Fed Funds rate
typically comes in at a mere 91 bps.  We
have repeatedly referred to this period as the “Central Bank Bubble”, as asset
values have inflated.
By growing
its balance sheet and keeping interest rates low, the Fed reasoned asset prices
would be backstopped and stimulated.  The
increase in asset prices would create a “wealth effect” as those in our society,
fortunate enough to own these assets, would feel wealthier and spend
money.  This, in turn, would result in
economic growth that would benefit society as a whole, including those at the
bottom end of the economic ladder.  The
result has not been what the Fed intended, and in fact, has caused some
unintended consequences.  The economy has
grown at the most anemic rate ever, around 2% per year, when recovering from any
recession.  Wealth disparity in our
society is at an all-time high.  At the
same time, by many different valuation metrics, the stock market is near or in excess
of the highest valuations in history.  As
of this writing, the trailing 12 month P/E based on generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) is approximately 24.2, a historically very high
number when the economy is not in a recession and earnings have already dropped
more than prices.
We believe
that in the long run, corporate earnings should grow about as fast as the
economy.  The stock market, in our view,
is imputing a higher growth rate to future earnings than we think is likely, or
even possible, for the following reasons:
We believe that the debt outstanding
in the US, which consists of federal, state, local, corporate, household, and
student loans, has been a major factor in the anemic growth of the past several
years.  This number currently stands at
$66tn, or about 330% of GDP.   The
servicing of this debt diverts resources from otherwise productive uses.  In addition, given the artificially low level
of interest rates, the exposure to rising rates is enormous and a major risk that
is not, in our view, universally appreciated. 
There is also the non-trivial matter of the unwinding of the Fed’s
balance sheet.  Selling bonds in the
market does not appear to be a consideration as that could cause a stampede out
of fixed income markets here and around the world.  We would like to point out that the “running
off” of the balance sheet (letting bonds mature) is another “experiment”.  In addition, estimates of the size of the
U.S. government’s unfunded liabilities and entitlements range from $80tn. to
$150tn.; and that is not even in the above numbers.  (More on this below.)The ECB, BOJ, and BOE have also adopted
“whatever it takes” policies.  They too
have greatly expanded their balance sheets and have even “upped the ante” with
previously unheard of negative interest rate policies.  Because of the liquidity of currency spot and
forward markets, much of that money has come into the U.S. to “chase
yield”.  This has further inflated and
distorted asset prices in the US.  Also,
the world’s second largest economy, China, has inflated a credit bubble with
breathtaking speed that, relative to its banking system, is the largest in the
world.  All of this further adds fuel to
the worldwide credit bubble fire.The growth rate in GDP is a function of
the change in total hours worked and the output per hour.  With the economy at, or near, full employment
there is not much room for growth in the total hours worked.  In addition, we are now at the point that the
“baby boomers” are retiring at the rate of about 10,000 people per day, while
new workers entering the work force number much less than that.  Immigration of skilled workers could
potentially help the problem, but thus far we see no rush on the part of the
Trump administration to address this meaningfully.On the productivity side, the alarm
was recently sounded by former Fed Chairman Greenspan.  He contends that the growth in entitlements
has crowded out savings, which in turn, means less capital flowing into
productive assets.  He calls entitlement
reform the third rail of US politics as our leaders are afraid to confront the
problem head on, for fear of being voted out. 
We completely agree.  
Thus, given the level of debt and commensurate interest rate
exposure, along with negative population demographics, and the lack of
addressing entitlement reform as it relates to long term productivity growth,
it is our strong belief that the US economy will not grow at rates that will
vindicate current equity market valuations. 
We remain committed to the thesis that the experimental Fed policies of
the past years have inflated and distorted equity and other asset prices
tremendously (while generating “unintended consequences”). 
In our view, this time is NOT different.  Ultimately the stock market will reflect an
economic reality much different than it does currently.  When that happens, as in past times when bull
markets ended, stocks will likely fall much faster than they went up.   HOW DOES GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROW?Population Demographics Will Work Against President Trump's Plan5/01/17 9:00 AM
A major
variable in the determination of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the growth of
the labor force.  What a nation produces
can be thought of, in simple terms, as the number of hours worked multiplied by
the output per hour (productivity).  It
is a documented fact that the growth rate of the U.S. labor force is declining
and is expected, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, to only increase by
.5% per year over the coming decade. 
This is slower than it has grown in past decades and is due to a combination
of many demographic factors, including the relative aging of the population.
President
Trump and members of his cabinet have stated that once his agenda items are
signed into law, the country will be on its way to 3%-4% growth.  As our viewers know, we have written many
times on the anemic sub 2% economic growth of the Obama years.  President Trump intends to reverse the trend
of lower growth by 1), Repealing and replacing the ACA (Affordable Care Act),
which has thus far been rejected.   2)
Shrinking regulations, including Dodd Frank. 3) Lower taxes for individuals and
corporations, both large and small. 4) Repatriation of $2 tn. to $ 3tn of
corporate cash residing abroad. 5) Implementing a national infrastructure
rebuilding plan that will replace many roads, bridges, airports and other major
items in desperate need of repair.
What
President Trump left out of these 5 “agenda” items is the fact that the only
way to double the growth in GDP is to increase population enough that more
people enter the labor force.   The
increase in the labor force should also coincide with an increase in
productivity. Anything that President Trump does that inhibits growth of the
part of the population that could become part of the labor force (such as
curbing legal immigration) will have a negative effect on the increase in
growth that he seeks to achieve.
Please
understand that President Trump is expressing his position of doubling the
growth rate of GDP with U.S. population demographics as a major road
block.  Due to the aging of the “baby boomers”,
10,000 potential labor force participants are retiring every day.  According to the Bureau of the Census, about
5,800 people are added to the U.S. population daily.  That is the net difference between births,
deaths, and immigration.  This is hardly
the situation that took place in the mid 70’s, 80’s and 90’s when “baby
boomers” entered the workforce in great numbers and the economy grew rapidly as
a result.  Thus, Presidents Reagan, GWH
Bush, and Clinton had relatively great economies in their presidential years,
from a growth standpoint.  
President
Trump needs to understand that the population demographics are working against
him, as never before, with fewer and fewer people entering the workforce.  Policies that he and his cabinet espouse need
to reflect the fact that our economy needs more, not less, workers.  Those workers should be as highly skilled as
possible, so that the productivity side of the equation is also a tailwind.
 Debt Can be Looked Upon in Various WaysWhat is the Real Total Debt in the U.S.A.?4/07/17 10:00 AM 
Comstock has
been discussing the debt situation in our country for years.  We wrote a “special report” discussing the
various forms of debt and explained how the debt is incorporated in “The Cycle
of Deflation” (see attachment) as the debt was hindering many speculators and
investors just before the dot.com bubble was about ready to collapse.  We warned that the debt was the main reason
that the valuations were the highest in history and would eventually break the
market.  This was exactly what took place
starting in March of 2000 when the stock market crashed and a severe recession
began.  
We again
warned our viewers about the problems of excessive debt during the housing
bubble of 2005 to 2008 when Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve
at the time, decided to lower interest rates to 1% in June of 2003.  This caused the largest housing mania of all
time.  Banks were virtually pushing money
to anyone that wanted a loan to buy a house (whether they could afford it or
not.)  Back then--they called these loans
“no doc loans”.  These were loans that
were made without any documentation whatsoever.
The amazing
part of this era was that Greenspan warned stock investors about the
“irrational exuberance” that was taking place in the late 1990s as the stock
market rose almost every day. The “irrational exuberance” speech drove the
market down, but that only scared off investors for just a few days and the
stock investors regained the losses almost immediately.  After observing the voracity of the market
that could not be held down, Greenspan changed his mind and confessed to being
wrong about his warnings just before the real break took place in early
2000.  He also witnessed the housing
bubble, and not only did he support the banks making the loans, but actually
encouraged the banks to continue making these insane loans.  
This leads
us to the old time phrase, “fool us one time, shame on you, fool us twice shame
on us.”  When the current debt bubble
breaks and the stock market collapses we could say, “Fool us 3 times and we
should be banned from trading and investing in the financial markets.”  Unless we can understand why the debt caused
the collapse in 1929 (after the roaring 1920’s), in 2000, and 2008, we should
be forced to compare the debt to GDP in all of these times to the present.
If you were
forced to do this you would look at the debt and be shocked at how much the
debt grew over the past two decades.  If
you are a Democrat you might compare how much the debt grew under President George
W. Bush and use examples of how much it grew during the eight years of his
administration. You could make comparisons like the debt grew more under George
W. than all past presidents (going back to George Washington).  If you are a Republican, you could make the
same comparisons of how much the debt grew under Barack Obama and make the same
comparisons (going back again to George Washington).  If you did make these comparisons you would
come close to going out of your mind, because it would have to scare you.  
The amazing
thing is the fact that you would be making the comparisons erroneously since
you would look at the debt doubling under George W. and then doubled again
under Barack Obama, and think we are in real trouble.  However, the debt you would be using is
strictly the government debt, and get scared as hell when you see the debt is
now just about equal to the GDP of the greatest country in the world at about
$20 trillion apiece.  
If, on the
other hand, you were looking deeper into the debt and could see that the debt
has grown much more than the GDP of our country.  In fact, the real debt relative to GDP is
actually about 370% of GDP if you include the government debt, the state and
local debt, student debt, credit market debt, and the loans made to foreign
banks overseas.  The 370% of debt
relative to GDP also should include all of the entitlements and other off
balance sheet debt that we include now. 
These are obligations that have been guaranteed to most of the people in
this country such as the entitlement promises of Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, and government employee pensions. 
If you take all of them into consideration the debt to GDP would not be
just 370% but closer to another $40 trillion of debt which would take the total
debt to over 500% of our GDP.  If that
doesn’t scare you nothing will!!
Now that
President Donald Trump will probably have as much trouble with his other agenda
items as he did with his repeal and replace of healthcare, the market could
have real problems.  And when this
enormous debt comes to light, we would expect the market to decline sharply.  The only way that the Trump Administration can survive without moving his agenda quickly this year would be to grow the economy close to the rate of 3 to 4 % as he predicted.  But it is very hard to grow nearly that fast with these demographics, retiring baby boomers, fewer immigrants--it is impossible to get corporations to make capital expenditures and productivity to increase without being able to increase the labor force. This is why they are in such a bind! THE STOCK MARKET IS PRICED FOR PERFECTIONBut Politics, Debt, and Stagflation May Change Things2/28/17 1:05 AM
The Trump
rally, which began during the overnight session the night of November 8th has,
in our view, built perfection into prices, which we think were already priced
to near perfection.  In the bull case, fundamentals
were already improving and President Trump’s proposed cutting of regulations,
taxes, and instituting pro-growth fiscal spending, just adds fuel to the fire.  It seems to us that every possible benefit of
the doubt is being given to the new administration in an economic and political
climate that is unprecedented in our lifetime, and possibly our country’s
history.
In addition,
there is nothing that says that President Trump will get all he wants from Congress.  The most positive outcome is being discounted
by the stock market presently and if there is resistance or delay with his
programs, the stock market will suffer. The U.S. will need to raise the debt
ceiling in mid-March, and we do not believe the market has focused on
that.  With debt and interest rate
exposure that are enormous, we do not believe that Republican deficit hawks,
that have spent their careers as such, will be so eager to approve spending
increases that are not offset by spending cuts.    Additionally, we expect Democratic
opposition to the President’s agenda to be fierce.  So the Trump programs which have been treated
by the market as a forgone conclusion will, in our view, be much more difficult.
The Fed
continues to state that three rate increases are on the table for 2017.  Our view of the matter is that the Fed is
walking a tightrope as the $20tn. of US debt is relatively short in duration, with
a maturity of just over 5 years, and just under a 2% average coupon.  Thus, there is enormous interest rate
exposure in terms of the debt and deficit, for that reason alone, it is likely
the Fed will be behind the curve.  The
exposure created by the $20tn. of debt (and possibly much more debt under President
Trump), along with $100tn. in unfunded liabilities and entitlements, puts the
US and the Fed in a very serious bind as each 1% increase in funding cost to
the government will add $200bn. to the national debt.  Additionally, as labor markets tighten (with
corresponding negative effects on profit margins), the Fed moving gingerly risks
an acceleration in inflation.
As our
readers know, we are believers that high debt is, in and of itself, a dampening
factor on economic growth.  We have also written
many times about how the 8 years of close to zero interest rates has caused
risk assets to be mispriced.  The European
Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) mimicked us, and even upped the ante
with negative rates.   And the BOJ
purchases of equities, has further inflated the bubble in Japan.  The newest economic superpower, China, is in
a credit bubble of its own that is even larger than ours as a percentage of its
economy.  While President Trump has
referred to China as a currency manipulator, they are doing exactly the
opposite.  A weak currency will only
exacerbate an already serious capital flight problem.  Therefore, they have been trying to
strengthen the Yuan.
There is an
argument being made currently by Alan Greenspan, that we are headed from
“Stagnation to Stagflation”.  In the
beginning of this cycle, profit margins and the stock market should move up as
inflation gains momentum.  But it will
not continue because what is really going on longer term is a problem with the
productivity of the economy.  As our
country ages and retires, we will not have an influx of baby boomers entering
the workforce like we had in the 1980’s and 1990’s. These population
demographics cause a problem with growth in entitlements.  The entitlements crowd out savings which
results in less investment in productive assets.  We subscribe to this argument and strongly
believe this to be a headwind to growth that will exist unless we get many more
workers entering the labor force.  More
working immigrants entering the country would ease the situation, but would
bring its own additional set of problems.
 On the subject of valuation, our favorite
measure is the trailing twelve month Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
P/E of the S&P 500.  With 92% of
S&P companies reporting (as of 2/24/17) it appears the trailing twelve
month GAAP earnings are just under $96. 
That’s a current P/E of 24.7. We don’t believe that a 2% growth
environment justifies that valuation.   Furthermore, analyst’s estimates compiled by
S&P, project that earnings growth in the next two years will be just under
17% a year.  This is in an economy which
has not been able to get above 2% annual growth and stay there.  Even if earnings did grow at that rate, the GAAP
P/E in 2 years (at this level of the market) would still be around 18, which is
historically expensive.  If the economy
and earnings are growing at that rate, one would have to think that interest
rates and inflation will rise.  And if GAAP
earnings are capitalized at significantly higher interest rates, it will
naturally be a problem for stocks. 
In summary, it
is our view that the market is in the third credit driven bubble of this
century.  We believe that the strong move
since the election has more to do with hopes and dreams of what could happen
rather than the reality of what is likely to happen.  The additional growth that could come as a
result of less regulation and lower taxes pales beside the inflation in asset
values, especially stocks, due to the policies of the Fed.  In that sense, it doesn’t actually matter all
that much who the president is. Debt and demographics are working against us
and it will take, in our view, a bear market of epic proportions to correct the
excesses in valuation that exist.

Why EVERY High Net Worth Investor Should Consider Selling Commodities Options













If you currently limit your asset mix to traditional investments, even if you write stock options, you’re missing out on what could be a powerful tool for growing and protecting your net worth.


…selling options was, in my opinion and not without risk, the single most productive approach I’d ever found to build equity in an account.




James Cordier, Founder







TOP 10 Reasons Why Every High Net Worth Investor Should Consider Selling Options








1. Powerful and Complete Diversification: Enjoy the relief that comes from finally getting properly diversified by owning a portfolio that is uncorrelated to everything – including the commodities indexes. You’ll no longer have to rely so heavily on the direction of the stock market for growing wealth for you and your heirs.


READ MOREClose


Discover Real Diversification


A commodity option selling portfolio offers a true diversifier – a freedom that is rare in the financial markets. Option Selling can be the key to the chains that bind you to your overweighted stock portfolio. Now you may argue that either 

a. I already own commodities in my portfolio… -or-
b. Commodities sometimes track the stock market – they’re not that diversified

Both of these statements could be true. And they would also both be irrelevant. For a commodities option selling portfolio can be totally uncorrolated to anything else, even the commodity indexes themselves. Why?






Two reasons.

1.Because commodities markets are much less correlated to each other than are stocks. For instance, if you buy shares of Exxon, Apple and Caterpillar and the DOW tanks, chances are your share values are all going down, regardless of how “good” they are. The are all stocks and there are many macro-economic factors that affect all stock prices. To commodity traders, “stocks” are simply one of many futures contracts. On the other hand, if you own contracts of natural gas, silver and soybeans, those are three widely different products with very different fundamentals that affect their price. The price of one has little to do with the price of the other. That gives you broad diversification. But that’s not the biggest reason.
2.Because as an option seller, you can sell puts and/or calls. That means that in addition to having positions in a variety of unrelated markets, you can be long, short or neutral – or all at the same time! As an option seller, you often don’t care what way the market is moving on a net basis. Your only concern is that it does not move sharply against your position in a short period of time. A macro economic event that tanks stocks or moves commodities indexes can be good, bad or neutral to your position as an option seller. An oil shock can have little effect on your position in coffee. Make sense?










2. Potential for outsize growth and/or income:  Option Selling Portfolios can produce 10-20 even 30%+ returns over the longer term making them a potentially high octane tool for wealth generation.


READ MOREClose


The Potential for Outsized Returns

If you are purely seeking an investment with some horsepower, this could be reason #1 for you. For while option selling can be “slow and boring” for the action oriented trader, the accumulated premiums and leverage of the futures markets can make them anything but. Stock option sellers take note: This ain’t selling covered calls on your Microsoft. This is option selling on steroids.
If you sell a stock option and take a $200 premium, you are generally paying 10 to 20 times that amount in margin to hold that position. In commodities options, you can sell options for


a. Much Higher premiums (we target $500 to $700 each)
b. Much Lower Margins (generally 1 ½ to 2 times the premium)

Thus a margin for a $500 option premium may only require a $750 to $1,000 margin requirement from you. We’ll let you do the math.





Suffice to say, if you get satisfaction from targeting potentially high ROI on your investments and are comfortable with a certain degree of risk, option selling on commodities could be a good choice for you.
Using commodities leverage to your advantage is covered thoroughly in our book The Complete Guide to Option Selling (3rd Edition) on sale in fine bookstores or here now. 










3. The Ability to be profitable in nearly ANY kind of market, economic or interest rate environment.


READ MOREClose


Can be Effective in Nearly Any Kind of Market
A major benefit of option selling (and one that makes if a favorite of the high net worth crowd) is that it can be effective in nearly any kind of market conditions. As covered above, this is especially true in commodities, where individual markets tend to move somewhat independently of each other. 

If you have a big chunk of your cash in stocks, it’s all good until you hit a market correction, a wave of volatility on some economic or geopolitical event, or an outright bear market. 
As an option seller, especially a commodities option seller, you have the ability to be successful in these kinds of markets.Option writing can be profitable in bull, bear or listless markets. Market volatility? Great! Volatile markets are the BEST markets in which to be an option writer. It was Buffet who said to be greedy when others are fearful. While your golf buddies are complaining about the “rough waters” the market is in, you can (potentially) be sailing in a cool breeze. Remember, you’re deep out of the money – way over or way under the market. While this doesn’t make you bulletproof to all market events, it does give you a great deal of flexibility and diversity to deal with what may come along. The end result for you is the peace of mindof knowing your portfolio has the potential to produce no matter what is happening in the financial markets.












4. Consistency of Trading with the Odds now on Your Side: Tired of always hearing about Wall Street Insiders and Hedge Fund managers having the drop on individual investors? Selling options lets you level the playing field. 


READ MOREClose


Trading with the Odds

This is one of the biggest advantages of selling options. As Alan Greenspan once said: “Amateurs want to be right. Professionals want to make money.” Option sellers don’t have to be right to make money. In option selling, you give up your chance to hit “home runs” in exchange for the consistency of hitting “singles” – over and over and over again. It is estimated that 75-85% of all options held at expiration will expire worthless. By using a few simple tools – you can select options with even higher odds than this of expiring worthless. If buying options is like going to the casino, selling options is like being the casino- where the odds are tilted in your favor.
A black jack dealer in Vegas only has a tiny edge over any particular player at his table. Yet if players sit there long enough, the dealer will eventually get all of their money. This exemplifies the power of using applied odds over time. 
The fact of the matter is, you can choose options with a 90, 95 even 99% chance of expiring worthless. When is the last time you got those kinds of odds buying a stock? While risk of loss is always present, as an option seller, you gain the confidence of knowing you are now trading with the percentages. 





“The strategy of selling options is, at its core, a strategy of using applied odds over time.”




The 80% figure (rightly) grabs people’s attention. Chat room “option geniuses” may argue this figure’s relevance. But few will argue an option sellers advantage over an option buyer. The fact that most investors don’t know how to harness these odds is not your problem. Let it be theirs.
This consistency – having the majority of your trades as winners instead of losers- can be not only psychologically beneficial to you, the trader, but give you more focus to act when there is a risk measure to be employed or a new opportunity to capture. 










5. Time is now Your powerful ally:  Investing is fraught with uncertainties. But there is no greater certainty than the passage of time. As an option seller, time is your greatest ally, ticking away at the value of your option as each day passes.


READ MOREClose


Time is on your Side

When selling (or writing) an option, time value works for you instead of against you. That means that whatever else is going on in the underlying market, you enjoy the comfort of knowing that the unwavering hands of Father Time are always working in your favor. 
When you sell an option, the buyer of the option pays you a premium for that option. If you sell an out of the money option, the entire value of that option is in time value. As time passes, all other things remaining constant, the option will gradually lose its value. This is called Time Decay and it’s one of the main reasons selling options can be so effective. It is for this reason that OptionSellers.com pursues a strategy of selling deep out of the money options in client portfolios.




The closer an option gets to expiration, the faster its rate of time decay.




The graph above illustrates the principle of time decay and its acceleration as expiration draws near. An option is considered a “wasting asset.” Time value erodes as each day passes, accelerating as the option’s expiration nears. This is referred to as time-decay. If the underlying contract’s price does not move to the option’s strike price by expiration, the option will have no value left and expire worthless and the option seller will keep the premium. Of course, as in any trading, a large move in the underlying may result in a loss. This is the concept on which our entire portfolio strategy is based. Notice that the value decays the fastest during the last 30-60 days of the option’s life.









6. Every trade has an expiration date:  Whether you own a stock, a piece of real estate, or even a commodities futures contract, one of the toughest decisions you’ll ever have to make is where to take profits on a successful trade. Avoiding that gut-wrenching decision is a big benefit enjoyed by the option seller.  


READ MOREClose


No Profit Taking Decisions

You have a profit on your trade? Now what? Do you take the money off the table now and risk that your about to miss out on an even bigger move? Or do you “let it ride” and risk the profit you’ve already made? 
One of the hardest parts of futures or any trading is deciding when to take profits. With option selling, if the market behaves favorably towards your position, you are relieved from the responsibility of making this decision. As time value decays your option, the market will gradually take profits for you. 
Upon expiration, if the option is still out of the money (has not reached your strike price), the entire premium for which you sold the option will be in your account. At this time, your position automatically closes out. 






However, you reserve the right to close out your short option position at any time prior to expiration as well – either as a loss limiting measure, or as a profit taking move. It’s a personal choice. In regard to taking a profit, some of the investors we’ve worked with find that it can be easier and require less effort to simply let the market “do it for them.”
Of course no “safe” trading system has ever been devised and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss.










7. Ease of low maintenence:  Unlike a stock option selling account, if you sell options in the manner described on this website, you won’t need to be by a computer screen all day. 


READ MOREClose


Low Maintenance Account

Deep out of the money options tend to move slowly and do not require minute by minute maintenance. That being said, this isn’t a sell it and forget it strategy either. Your positions will need some adjustments from time to time. Many high net worth investors choose to remove themselves from the trading equation entirely, instead hiring a professional to handle the day to day trading and position management for them. Now that’s low maintenance!











8. Security of investing in hard commodities:  Commodities, unlike stocks, will always have a value. 


READ MOREClose


Investing in Real Products that will Always Hold Value – Not a piece of paper.**
2008 may seem like a long time ago. But investors that watched their net worth melt away through that market collapse took a key lesson away from it – At the end of the day, shares of stock are merely a piece of paper. If you really want to drive that lesson home, look up a little blip in the stock market that took place in 1929. 
We all remember 9/11. Remember Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns? How about Enron? On the days and weeks any of those events occurred, when companies and paper became worthless, (or perceived to be worthless), people still woke up and ate their corn flakes and drank their orange juice. They still put gasoline in their cars and drove to work, where they drank their coffee and ate their chocolate doughnut made with wheat, sugar and cocoa. And to comfort themselves, they went home to their nice warm natural gas heated home, got out a pound of ground beef (raised on USDA approved soybean meal) for dinner and retired to their den. Here they retrieved their gold and silver coins they had hidden in the safe and counted them to comfort themselves in the moment. Why? Because they had value. And they feared when they turned on their computer screen tomorrow, all of that paper they had their money in would not. 


“Sugar can’t go bankrupt. Soybeans can’t go out of business.”
Does this mean the commodities are always a better investment than stocks? Not at all. One is not necessarily superior to the other. Are we suggesting that stocks are more dangerous or “risky” than commodities? Of course not. 
What it does mean is that no matter what goes on in the world, commodities, such as the ones listed above, will always have some kind of demand. And where there is demand there will always be value. It may not always be the same value. But a value nonetheless. A pound of sugar will always be worth something to someone. Same for a barrel of oil or a bushel of wheat. 
As a high net worth investor, you are likely already aware of the crucial practice of diversifying your assets. With commodities, you gain an extra feeling of security in knowing you have a component of your assets in investments you can hold in your hand –a lump of silver, a gallon of gas, a bushel of corn – things you can touch, feel, use. No matter what happens in the world, it remains likely that Americans are still going to want breakfast in the morning and dinner at night, fill up the gas tank, stay warm or cool, and feel “safe” with some precious metal in the closet. The same cannot be said for pieces of paper that have names like “Enron” or “Lehman” printed on them.





“Sugar can’t go bankrupt. Soybeans can’t go out of business. Commodities will always have a value.”











9. Relax. You don’t have to try to predict the future anymore. 


READ MOREClose


No More Trying to Guess Market Direction

No matter what they say, nobody knows what any market is going to do, especially on a short-term basis. However, do enough homework, and it is sometimes possible to make a fairly accurate projection of where prices will not go on a longer term basis. By selling deep out of the money options, you avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today, tomorrow or next week. Instead you are only projecting where you think prices won’t go. For instance, if you are bullish the natural gas market, you might sell a deep out of the money put option. In this case, the market can move up, stay the same or even move down, as long as it is above your strike price upon expiration, you will still take your full profit.
As an Option Seller, you accept the fact that you cannot predict the future. You free yourself from the “need” for the market to move in a particular direction. You are satisfied to simply “bet” against the unlikely events and then take a payment for your efforts – over and over again. While there is still risk in this strategy, you have the ability to profit regardless of which direction the market is moving, or even if it does not move at all. And you relieve yourself of the stress that comes from trying to accomplish the nearly impossible. 
At the same time, you’ll also free yourself from the requirement of having perfect timing. When buying a stock or futures contract, when you enter your position is just as important as what you are buying. In selling deep out of the money options, the option values typically aren’t moving as quickly as the underlying stock or commodity. The fact that they are deep out of the money can mean that daily fluctuations in the underlying market may not have a large impact on the price of the option. Thus your timing becomes less important. 
Although all futures trading carries some degree of risk, done correctly, option selling can place your position in the market far enough away that short term swings in the market may not dramatically affect your position. This not only gives you staying power but allows you to focus on longer term market fundamentals. Relief from this decision means lower stress for you.





“Avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today, tomorrow or next week. The purpose of analyzing a market now simply becomes a practice of picking a far away point where it won’t go.”










10. Efficiency in keeping more of what you earn:  Option Selling is a tax-friendly strategy.


READ MOREClose


10. The Option Sellers Tax Advantage

If you think you pay your “fair share” and then some, commodity option selling could be the right strategy for you. Profits on option selling are taxed on the “60/40” rule – 40% as short term capital gains but 60% at the same rate as dividends. This makes them a favorable investment for those in high tax brackets. 
In addition, your end of year taxes on your commodity option selling account are surprisingly simple. You get a straight 1099 (profit/loss) statement and you pay your taxes based on that one figure. No more reconciling each and every trade for the year.This aspect makes the investment both simple to account for and tax efficient.











The Downside of Option Selling
There is, of course, no perfect investment. Like any other form of wealth generation, option selling has its risks and drawbacks. The two main ones are these:

It can be slow and boring: If you’re into active trading and the daily action of the markets – selling options in the manner prescribed here is not for you. Sure, there will be days where some sort of activity is required. However, for the most part, selling deep out of the money commodities options holds all of the excitement of watching paint dry – at least over the short term.
Fat tail risk: There is, of course, risk in selling options – even deep out of the money options. While the risk of your options ever going in the money (using the method we prescribe) is remote, your primary risk is that of the value of your option increasing (usually the result of a sudden and sharp move in the underlying combined with a surge in volatility) That is why experienced and diligent risk management is so critical to your performance. Contrary to popular belief, there are a few simple, yet highly effective methods of managing risk when selling options. 

That being said, in my 30+ years of professional trading experience, selling options is, in my opinion and not without risk, the single most productive approach I’ve ever found to growing long term equity in an account. 
If you are an intelligent, rational, high net worth individual who is looking for an investment approach that targets high returns with reasonable risks, has relatively high odds of success on each individual trade and requires a semi passive, lower stress type of management style, option selling could be right for you. To learn the complete strategy of option selling and how to use it in your portfolio – I recommend our third book The Complete Guide to Option Selling, 3rd Edition (McGraw Hill 2014). For a more introductory outline of the strategy, our free no obligation booklet – The Option Selling Solution will do the trick for you. If you’d like to learn more about how we can manage an option selling account for you, you’ll want to get our comprehensive Investor Discovery Pack. 
While only you can decide if this type of investing is right for you and your wealth management goals, I recommend any high net worth investor consider it as a crucial component of an overall asset mix.

 View Chart Explanation
 Download Chart Data (.CSV)
How can the Fund trade at a premium/discount to its NAV?
The primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the NAV and the closing price of the Fund. Since shares of the Fund trade on the open market, prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors, corporations and financial institutions. Depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment, shares of the Fund may deviate slightly from the value of the Fund's underlying assets. As a result, shareholders may pay more than NAV when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices. However, due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to ETFs, market makers are able to minimize these deviations from NAV by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
What causes these time discrepancies?
Close of Trading Times. Although both the NAV and the closing trade of the Fund are generally calculated at the closing time of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies.
Time of Last Trade. Trading of Global X funds generally takes place during normal trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time). However, it is important to note that the last trade - from which the closing price is determined - may not occur at exactly 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Therefore, changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the NAV to deviate from the closing price.
International Holdings. The premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets. Because the Funds trade during U.S. market hours while the underlying securities may not, the time lapse between the markets can result in differences between the NAV and the closing price.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The investable universe of companies in which the Fund may invest may be limited. The Fund invests in securities of companies engaged in Information Technology which can be affected by rapid product obsolescence, and intense industry competition. In addition to normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. The fund is non-diversified which represents a heightened risk to investors.
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Global X NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees, expenses or sales charges. One cannot invest directly in an index.
Since the Fund’s Shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund’s inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns.
Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Fund’s full or summary prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-888-GX-FUND-1 (1.888.493.8631), or by visiting globalxfunds.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
