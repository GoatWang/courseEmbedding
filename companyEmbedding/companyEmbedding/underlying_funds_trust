Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5 business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Fees

•

Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities. None

•

Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities. None

Product management
Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Trust II uses an asset allocation strategy designed for investors planning to retire between 2018 and 2022. The trust seeks to provide growth of capital and current income consistent with its current target allocation by investing in a gradually more conservative mix of the following Vanguard funds: Total Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Total International Bond Index Fund, and Total International Stock Index Fund. The combination of funds produces a portfolio that is diversified by asset class and holdings.Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Trust II is one of a series of Vanguard life-cycle funds that use a targeted maturity approach as a simplified way to meet investors’ different objectives, time horizons, and changing risk tolerances. As your retirement date approaches, the trust’s allocation will grow more conservative and will begin to invest in the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund to provide a hedge against inflation while dampening the overall volatility of the portfolio. In this regard, the trust diversifies both stock and conventional bond exposure. Within seven years after 2020, the trust’s asset allocation should resemble that of the Target Retirement Income Trust II.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
The trust is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the trust’s current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the trust’s overall level of risk should be higher than those trusts that invest mostly in bonds, but lower than those investing mostly in stocks. As the trust’s allocation between underlying funds gradually changes, the trust’s overall level of risk also will decline. In addition to the risks inherent in the asset classes of the underlying funds, the trust also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the trust to underperform other trusts with a similar investment objective. Investments in Target Retirement Trusts are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the trust name refers to the approximate year 2020 when an investor in the trust would retire and leave the work force. The trust will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in the Target Retirement Trust is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.

		*Since Inception performance is as of the first full month the fund was open. Total return assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains for the periods indicated. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Gross performance has been calculated before the deduction of investment management and client service fees, but after the deduction of all other expenses applicable to the fund. Net Performance has been calculated after the deduction of the Annual Expense Ratio of the fund as well as a hypothetical management fee of 0.35%. Investment return and principal value will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares.
Amounts withdrawn may not be transferred to a competing option for 90 days after withdrawal.


The Barclays U.S. Treasury Bellwethers 3-Month Index is tracked by Barclays to provide performance for the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill. An investment cannot be made directly in an index.

Investment Objective
The primary investment objective of the Fund will be to seek the preservation of principal and to provide interest income reasonably obtained under prevailing market conditions and rates, consistent with seeking to maintain required liquidity.


Investor Profile
The Invesco Stable Value Trust may be appropriate for investors who seek little fluctuation in the value of their invested principal, a competitive interest rate, and a low level of overall risk.


Investment Strategy
The Fund's returns are based on returns generated by an actively managed, highly diversified portfolio of investment grade, fixed and floating rate securities. The Fund may invest in such securities directly or indirectly through commingled investment vehicles (the 'building block strategy'). This building block strategy may provide greater diversification than could be achieved by investing in individual bonds. This building block strategy also may reduce the unintended impact on portfolio characteristics created by participant cash flow.
The Sub-Advisor takes diversification a step further by retaining unaffiliated managers to manage a portion of the portfolio, whether directly or indirectly through commingled investment vehicles. The style diversification provided by unaffiliated managers may lead to improved consistency. The minimum average credit rating of the Fund's investments (or if such investments are interests in commingled investment vehicles, the underlying investments held by such vehicles) must be Aa3/AA- by Moody's/S&P or an equivalent as determined by another NRSRO (as defined below). Duration, maturity selection, spread volatility, sector and security selection are each potential sources of return.
In addition to the fixed income investments above, the Fund may enter into security investment contracts (sometimes called 'wrap agreements') issued by banks and insurance companies. These contracts are linked to the Fund's fixed income investments and are generally intended to allow for plan participant transactions to be effected at book value and the amortization of underlying fixed income gains and losses over a specified period of time through adjustments to the future contract interest crediting rate (which is the rate earned by investors in the Fund). The investment contracts provide that the adjustments to the interest crediting rate will not result in a future interest crediting rate that is less than zero. In general, if the contract value of the investment agreements exceeds the market value of the underlying investments (including accrued interest), the investment contract issuer becomes obligated to pay that difference to the Fund in the event that permitted plan participant redemptions result in a total contract liquidation. The circumstance under which payments are made and the timing of payments between the Fund and the contract issuer may vary based on the terms of the investment contracts, and the investment contract issuer's obligation to pay is subject to significant conditions relating to, among other things, the types and frequency of redemptions from or by the Fund.
The Fund may also invest in traditional guaranteed investment contracts or insurance company separate account contracts as defined in the investment guidelines.
Valuation and Reporting
The Fund's assets will be valued and reported in accordance with the Declaration of Trust and the provisions of and any amendments to ASC 825, Financial Instruments, ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and ASC 946-210, Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts Held by Certain Investment Companies Subject to the AICPA Investment Company Guide and Defined Contributions Health and Welfare and Pension Plans (FSP AAG INV-1 and SOP 94-4-1), and other standards of financial accounting and reporting, if any, applicable to the Fund's investments.

Investment Guidelines
Permitted Investments
In general, the Fund's assets will consist of units of various high quality commingled fixed income investment funds that, when held inside investment contracts as described below, are intended to provide stable account values.
Investment Contracts
Investment contracts selected for the Fund are those that are acceptable to the Investment Manager considering creditworthiness, contract features, and administrative capabilities at the time of purchase. Investment contracts contain provisions that generally require the issuing institution to provide plan permitted liquidity from the Fund as needed at book value.

Security Investment Contracts
Approved security investment contracts may be purchased from insurance companies, banks, or other financial institutions. The investment performance of these contracts is typically related to a portfolio of investments held in custody accounts associated with the contracts. The acceptable assets held inside security investment contracts are described below under Acceptable Assets.
Traditional Investment Contracts
Approved traditional investment contracts may be purchased from insurance companies, banks or other financial institutions. A traditional investment contract is a direct obligation backed by the creditworthiness of the issuing entity.
Separate Account Contracts
Approved separate account contracts may be purchased from insurance companies. The investment performance of these contracts is typically related to a portfolio of investments held inside the related separate accounts. The assets are held in a separate account of the issuer and are protected from other creditors of the issuer. The acceptable assets held in separate account contracts are described below under Acceptable Assets.

Acceptable Assets
Acceptable assets that may be held inside investment contracts are publicly or privately issued fixed, floating or variable rate obligations of the following issuers (held either directly or indirectly through affiliated or unaffiliated commingled investment vehicles):

U.S Treasury Notes and Bonds
U.S. Agency or Government-Sponsored Entity (GSE) Notes and Bonds.
Mortgage Pass Through Securities (MBS) and Mortgage TBA rolls as a strategy.
Structured Securities (including, Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS), Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMO), Asset-Backed Securities (ABS), and other structured trusts.

Non-corporates: Sovereign; Supranationals; Foreign Agencies; and Foreign Local Governments (including Yankee bonds).
Municipal securities.
Bank-sponsored short-term investment funds, cash and cash equivalents (including Section 4(2) commercial paper).
Repurchase Agreement. The maximum term of these agreements will be 60 days, and the collateral must be marked-to-market daily.
Interest rate futures, options and interest rate swaps.

Interest rate futures, options and swaps may be used to manage yield curve or duration or other risk positions. Derivatives must abide by the duration, credit quality, and all other constraints under these guidelines. Purchases and sales may be transacted for regular or deferred/forward settlement.
Investment Constraints
Credit and Diversification

Traditional investment contract issuers must, at the time of purchase, be rated at least A- by Moody's, S&P, or other Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) and approved by the Investment Manager. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested with a traditional investment contract issuer shall not exceed 5% at the time of purchase. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested in traditional investment contracts shall not exceed 25% at the time of purchase.
Separate account contract issuers must be approved by the Investment Manager at the time of purchase. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested with a separate account contract issuer shall not exceed 33% at the time of purchase.
Security investment contract issuers must be approved by the Investment Manager at the time of purchase. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested with a security investment contract issuer shall not exceed 33% at the time of purchase.
The minimum credit rating of the Fund's investments must be investment grade (BBB-/Baa3) or equivalent by another NRSRO. Split rated securities are permitted provided that at least one rating is of investment grade. For all ratings, the higher rating applies. A security no longer meeting this minimum must be sold within 6 months, unless an exemption is granted by the Investment Manager.
The minimum average credit rating of the Fund's investments must be Aa3/AA- by Moody's, S&P, or another NRSRO.

Duration
The Fund shall normally be managed with a weighted average duration of not less than one and one half years and not more than four years. Short-term investments must be included in the calculation of the Fund's duration. While a range of two to four years is preferred, the Fund will be managed opportunistically, consistent with the investment objectives set forth above.
Other Constraints
The Investment Manager may hold short-term investments or other fixed income vehicles allowing ready access to cash for plan participant liquidity needs, such as plan participant withdrawal and transfer requests.


Additional Information

 Principal Risks of Investing
			 


The Fund is designed to preserve principal investment and provide a competitive level of interest income. However, when investing in a the Fund, you should consider the following risks:
General Investment Risk - Investors could lose all or a portion of their investment in the Fund. Investors should not invest in the Fund unless they can readily bear the consequences of such loss.
Suitability Risk - Investors are expected to select investments whose investment strategies are consistent with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Wrap Contract Risk - default by a wrap issuer; costs reduce Fund performance; new wraps have less favorable terms or higher costs; poor Fund performance may lead to constrained Fund investments, reducing Fund performance; small number of wrap issuers concentrates exposure; termination of a wrap could result in loss of book value coverage.
Crediting Rate Risk - The Fund's credited rate will generally lag market interest rates. Wrap contract crediting rates may go down if a large number of participants request redemptions from the Fund.
Market Risk - The prices of securities held by the Fund may go down due to general market and economic conditions.
Inflation Risk - The Fund's principal investment may not maintain the same purchasing power in the future if inflation rises.
Leverage Risk - Leveraging magnifies changes, favorable or unfavorable, in the value of the portfolio's securities.
Interest Rate Risk - Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and rise as interest rates fall. Bond portfolios are riskier when interest rates rise. Long maturity bonds have more interest rate risk.
Yield Curve Risk - Yield curve risk refers to the risk that the Fund will be adversely impacted by changes in the differences between interest rates on shorter term and longer term debt instruments.
Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk of an issuer's financial health deterioriating, which may result in a credit rating downgrade and the issuer's inability to make timely bond payments.
Spread Risk - Spread risk is the risk that changes in the difference between the yields of debt instruments (whether due to credit quality or otherwise) could adversely affect the Fund.
Liquidity Risk - When the Fund has difficulty in selling an asset quickly, it faces liquidity risk.
Call Risk - If a callable bond is redeemed before maturity, the Fund may be forced to reinvest the principal at a lower interest rate.
Prepayment Risk - Homeowners may pay off their mortgages early. This forces the Fund to reinvest the principal sooner than expected, which could be at a lower interest rate.
Derivatives Risk - For some derivatives, the Fund could lose more than the amount invested. If the Fund uses derivatives to "hedge" portfolio risk, the hedge may not succeed.
Active Trading Risk - The Fund may engage in frequent trading to achieve its investment objective. If the Fund does trade frequently, it may incur increased costs, which can lower the Fund's return.
Management Risk - The investment techniques and risk analyses used by the Fund's portfolio managers may not produce the desired results.
Securities Lending Risk - The Fund or the vehicles in which it invests may may participate in securities lending programs. The lending fund bears the risk of investment loss associated with any reinvestment of securities lending collateral held by the lending fund.
Risks Associated with Investing in an Investment Vehicle  - The Fund may itself invest in an investment vehicle, such as a private investment or commingled fund. When it does so, the investing fund is subject to the underlying risk of that investment vehicle's portfolio securities.
Increase in Expenses Risk - The actual cost of investing may be higher than the expenses listed in the expense table for a variety of reasons, including termination of a voluntary fee waiver or losing portfolio fee breakpoints if average net assets decrease. The risk of expenses increasing because of a decrease in average net assets is heightened when markets are volatile.
Not FDIC Insured Risk - The investment is not a deposit or obligation of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other U.S. governmental agency.
Accounts of Affiliates of the Investment Manager - Affiliated managers may trade in securities at the same time as the Fund and, therefore, may potentially affect prices or available opportunities.
No Securities Registration - The Fund is exempt from registration with the SEC. Units of the Fund are exempt from registration with the SEC. Neither is registered with any state securities regulator.
No CFTC Registration - The Fund is not registered as a commodity pool with the CFTC because the Trustee is exempt from having to register as a commodity pool operator under CFTC Rule 4.5.

 *About fees and expenses


The Annual Expense Ratio does not include the management fee or any client service fees that may be paid to third party administrators. 
Contact your Plan Sponsor to obtain the management fee in effect for your plan and the names of any third parties receiving any client servicing fees for this fund. 

The Standard Management Fee listed is the standard fee used to calculate net performance. The actual investment management fee varies for each Plan based on the fee negotiated with the Plan. This negotiated fee can fluctuate daily based on the various asset level breakpoints reached at the time the daily fee accrual is calculated for each Plan.

Fund operating expenses are annualized as of the most recent year end. Operating expenses may include: portfolio valuation and accounting, transfer agency, custody, annual report and audit fees. The investment manager does not asses any fee in connection with the purchase or redemption of units of the fund.

This fund invests in other funds/investment vehicles. There are expenses ('Acquired Fund Expenses'), such as sub-advisor fees, associated with those investments which are estimated. The acquired fund expenses are included in the total fund expense ratio. All acquired fund expenses for the underlying funds/vehicles in existence for greater than one year are as of the prior calendar year end audited financial statements. All funds/vehicles less than one year are unaudited and as of the most recent period.

There are fees associated with financial institutions providing wrapped investment contracts. These fees are included in the operating expenses of the fund and are reflected in the gross crediting rate, gross and net performance.

Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5 business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Fees

•

Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities. None

•

Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities. None

Product management
Vanguard Target Retirement 2010 Trust I uses an asset allocation strategy designed for investors who planned to retire between 2008 and 2012. The trust seeks to provide growth of capital and current income consistent with its current target allocation by investing in a gradually more conservative mix of the following Vanguard funds: Total Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Total International Stock Index Fund, Total International Bond Index Fund, and Short-Term Inflation-Protected Index Fund. The combination of funds produces a portfolio that is diversified by asset class and holdings.Vanguard Target Retirement 2010 Trust I is one of a series of Vanguard life-cycle trusts that use a targeted maturity approach as a simplified way to meet investors’ different objectives, time horizons, and changing risk tolerances. As your retirement date approaches, the trust’s allocation will grow more conservative and will invest more in the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund to provide a hedge against inflation while dampening the overall volatility of the portfolio. In this regard, the trust diversifies both stock and conventional bond exposure. Within seven years after 2010, the trust’s asset allocation should resemble that of the Target Retirement Income Trust I.

The trust is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the trust’s current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the trust’s overall level of risk should be higher than those trusts that invest mostly in bonds, but lower than those investing mostly in stocks. As the trust’s allocation between underlying funds gradually changes, the trust’s overall level of risk also will decline. In addition to the risks inherent in the asset classes of the underlying funds, the trust also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the trust to underperform other trusts with a similar investment objective. Investments in Target Retirement Trusts are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the trust name refers to the approximate year 2010 when an investor in the trust would retire and leave the work force. The trust will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in the Target Retirement Trust is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
