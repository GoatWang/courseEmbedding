History[edit]
Dillard's is the outgrowth of a department store founded in 1938 by William T. Dillard; its corporate headquarters remain located at the eastern edge of Little Rock's Riverdale area, and many of its executives and directors are members of the Dillard family. The family still controls the company through its ownership of Class B Common Stock; the Class A common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[5]

Beginnings[edit]
Dillard sold the original five and dime store in Nashville, Arkansas, to develop a department store in Texarkana, Arkansas, initially as the minority partner in Wooten & Dillard. In 1956, Dillard led an investment group that acquired the Mayer & Schmidt store in Tyler, Texas. This store eventually took on the name "Dillard's Mayer & Schmidt" until 1974, when it was replaced with a mall-based location south of downtown Tyler.
In 1960, Dillard acquired and turned around the failing Brown-Duncan store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The success of this turnaround was followed in late 1963 by acquiring the Joseph Pfeifer store in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in early 1964 acquiring the other main store in Little Rock, Gus Blass Co. Dillard used this as an opportunity to relocate his headquarters to Little Rock. In 1969, Dillard and his investors took Dillard Department Stores, Inc., public on the American Stock Exchange.
Thereafter, the chain expanded rapidly as an anchor in suburban shopping malls, and took advantage of market conditions to acquire smaller chains as well as its ability to turn around locations that other companies could not operate profitably.
Acquisitions and expansion[edit]
Expansion of the Dillard's chain increased rapidly during the 1970s, mainly through expanding into new malls being built in smaller cities in Texas. In 1971 five Texas units were acquired from Fedway, a division of Federated Department Stores (the stores were rebadged as Dillard's in 1972). In 1974 five Leonard's stores were acquired in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as a commitment to open a new downtown Fort Worth store at the Tandy Center (site of the original Leonard's). Also in 1974, the former Brown-Dunkin, Blass, Pfeifer and Mayer & Schmidt stores were fully renamed Dillard's.

The 1980s brought the purchase of many local chains. In 1982, Dillard's leased three units of the defunct Lowenstein's chain in Memphis, Tennessee. In early 1984, Dillard’s acquired 12 Stix, Baer & Fuller stores in St. Louis and Kansas City from Associated Dry Goods Corp., while in fall 1984 two department store divisions were purchased from Dayton-Hudson Corporation: Diamond's and John A. Brown, with locations in Arizona, Nevada and Oklahoma. Twelve stores in Kansas and Missouri belonging to R. H. Macy & Co.'s Midwest Division, which was later dissolved in 2006, were acquired in early 1986, while the three-unit Hemphill-Wells company in West Texas was purchased in the summer. The stores at Sunset Mall in San Angelo and South Plains Mall in Lubbock were both converted, while the third in downtown Lubbock was closed.[6]

In 1987, Dillard's purchased 26 of Joske's 27 stores in Texas and Arizona as well as the four unit Cain-Sloan chain in Nashville, Tennessee, from Allied Stores Corp. This deal gave Dillard's two major anchor locations at several malls in Texas and Arizona with many of the second locations being converted to a separate, expanded home and men's stores, a format that Dillard's utilized greatly, both to grow its store size cost effectively and to prevent competitors from gaining valuable real estate. Additionally the Joske's acquisition gave Dillard's entry into the Houston market.
Dillard's in 1988 acquired the former Selber Bros. clothing department store chain, founded in 1907 in Shreveport, Louisiana, which also had a few locations in Texas.[7]
In 1988, Dillard's purchased the three-unit Miller & Paine chain in Lincoln, Nebraska, as well as more significantly, a half-interest and operational control of The Higbee Co., based in Cleveland, Ohio, with partner Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd., of New Orleans, was purchased in 1989, bringing 18 units primarily in Louisiana, as well two former Diamond's units in Tucson, Arizona.
1990s acquisitions[edit]
The Ivey's chain of 23 stores in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina was acquired from BATUS in 1990. This was followed by the acquisition of eight Florida Gulf Coast stores from Maison Blanche Co. in 1991 (which had acquired them as Robinsons of Florida only a few years before). In 1992, the remaining interest in the Higbee's stores were acquired, as well as five Ohio stores from Horne's (as part of a legal settlement, Dillard's having canceled a 1988 deal to acquire the chain). Also in 1992, three stores from the Hess's chain liquidation (five other former Hess's were acquired in 1994), two E.M. Scarbrough's locations in Austin, Texas, two former Thalhimer's in South Carolina and Tennessee, a former Lord & Taylor store in Memphis, Tennessee and three former Belk-Lindsey stores in Florida were acquired by Dillard's. Except for two Belk of Columbia stores acquired in 1995, acquisitions were eschewed for several years until in early 1997 ten buildings in Florida were acquired from Mervyns, seven southern Virginia stores were purchased from Proffitt's (which had acquired them from Hess's in 1993), and the three suburban Macy's stores in Houston were absorbed.
Late 1990s[edit]
The deal-making culminated with the purchase of Mercantile Stores Co., Inc., in 1998. The purchase of this Fairfield, Ohio-based department store company brought several chains, including Bacon's, Castner Knott, de Lendrecie's, Gayfers, Glass Block, Hennessy's, J.B. White, Joslins, Lion Store, Maison Blanche, McAlpin's, Root's and The Jones Store. Dillard's sold 26 stores of the former Mercantile Stores to May Department Stores Co. and Saks Incorporated and traded an additional seven stores to Belk for nine of theirs in southern Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Overall this deal enabled Dillard's to enhance its position in several markets in the South, Midwest and Mountain states.
Also in 1998, the chain entered California, opening its first store in a former Weinstock's at Weberstown Mall in Stockton, California.[8] In 1999 Dillard's opened a store at Mall of Georgia near Atlanta, Georgia.
Recent events[edit]




Dillard’s in Fairview, Texas opened on March 10, 2010.


After the acquisition of Mercantile, Dillard's ceased expanding through acquisitions, although eight locations of the defunct Montgomery Ward in the Midwest, and four locations from ZCMI in Utah and Idaho were acquired in 2001.
In 2004, Dillard's store credit card operation, operated as Dillard's National Bank, was sold to GE Money Bank. Customers can now be issued Dillard's/American Express cards as well the traditional Dillard's store charge. These cards can be used at any store that accepts the American Express brand.
In 2005 Dillard's opened a store at Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2008, Dillard's closed their travel agency, Dillard's Travel, alongside all in-store locations due to economic conditions. Dillard's Travel previously operated in 43 of the 318 stores.[9][10]
Current operations[edit]

Map of Dillard's locations


The chain continues to expand and has recently added stores in non-traditional mall shopping centers. Currently, the largest Dillard's store at 365,000 square feet (33,000 m²) is located at Scottsdale Fashion Square, an enclosed super-regional mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. Within the Dallas area, the chain has two flagship stores with a 299,000-square-foot (27,800 m2) store at the Northpark Center in Dallas and a 310,000-square-foot (29,000 m2) store at the North East Mall in Hurst.[11] Its flagship store in the East Coast region, at 260,000 square feet (24,000 m2), is located in the MacArthur Center in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. The home store for the chain is in Little Rock; the divided store is located in the trend-conscious Park Plaza Mall, one of the city's oldest continuously operating shopping centers in its midtown section.
In several "upper-scale" locations - like Simon Malls-owned Midland Park Mall, Texas, or in locations where another acquired store existed before the merger, Dillards operates both Men's and Women's stores; both are located within the same mall but in separate, distinct "anchor" (locations). Dillard's also maintains separate Men's and Women's anchor stores at Cielo Vista Mall and Sunland Park Mall, both in El Paso, Texas; the Mall of Abilene in Abilene, Tx; the Battlefield Mall in Springfield, Missouri; Melbourne Square Mall in Melbourne, Florida; Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; First Colony Mall in Sugar Land, Texas (suburban Houston); South Plains Mall in Lubbock, TX; Westgate Mall in Amarillo, TX; Golden Triangle Mall in Denton, TX; Central Mall in Fort Smith, Arkansas; Lakeline Mall in Cedar Park, Texas (suburban Austin); Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio, (suburban Cleveland); Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas (suburban Kansas City); Towne West Square in Wichita, Kansas; Sikes Senter Mall in Wichita Falls, TX; Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Northpark Mall in Ridgeland, Mississippi; and the Frontier Mall in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The two Great Lakes Mall stores, however, have since consolidated into one, with the other, located around the corner from the Macy's, sitting empty with signs redirecting customers to the consolidated store.
At Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach, Florida, Dillard's operates three separate two-story buildings: Dillard's East, a men's/home store; Dillard's South, a children's/juniors store; and Dillard's West, a women's store.[12]

History[edit]
Dillard's is the outgrowth of a department store founded in 1938 by William T. Dillard; its corporate headquarters remain located at the eastern edge of Little Rock's Riverdale area, and many of its executives and directors are members of the Dillard family. The family still controls the company through its ownership of Class B Common Stock; the Class A common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[5]

Beginnings[edit]
Dillard sold the original five and dime store in Nashville, Arkansas, to develop a department store in Texarkana, Arkansas, initially as the minority partner in Wooten & Dillard. In 1956, Dillard led an investment group that acquired the Mayer & Schmidt store in Tyler, Texas. This store eventually took on the name "Dillard's Mayer & Schmidt" until 1974, when it was replaced with a mall-based location south of downtown Tyler.
In 1960, Dillard acquired and turned around the failing Brown-Duncan store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The success of this turnaround was followed in late 1963 by acquiring the Joseph Pfeifer store in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in early 1964 acquiring the other main store in Little Rock, Gus Blass Co. Dillard used this as an opportunity to relocate his headquarters to Little Rock. In 1969, Dillard and his investors took Dillard Department Stores, Inc., public on the American Stock Exchange.
Thereafter, the chain expanded rapidly as an anchor in suburban shopping malls, and took advantage of market conditions to acquire smaller chains as well as its ability to turn around locations that other companies could not operate profitably.
Acquisitions and expansion[edit]
Expansion of the Dillard's chain increased rapidly during the 1970s, mainly through expanding into new malls being built in smaller cities in Texas. In 1971 five Texas units were acquired from Fedway, a division of Federated Department Stores (the stores were rebadged as Dillard's in 1972). In 1974 five Leonard's stores were acquired in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as a commitment to open a new downtown Fort Worth store at the Tandy Center (site of the original Leonard's). Also in 1974, the former Brown-Dunkin, Blass, Pfeifer and Mayer & Schmidt stores were fully renamed Dillard's.

The 1980s brought the purchase of many local chains. In 1982, Dillard's leased three units of the defunct Lowenstein's chain in Memphis, Tennessee. In early 1984, Dillard’s acquired 12 Stix, Baer & Fuller stores in St. Louis and Kansas City from Associated Dry Goods Corp., while in fall 1984 two department store divisions were purchased from Dayton-Hudson Corporation: Diamond's and John A. Brown, with locations in Arizona, Nevada and Oklahoma. Twelve stores in Kansas and Missouri belonging to R. H. Macy & Co.'s Midwest Division, which was later dissolved in 2006, were acquired in early 1986, while the three-unit Hemphill-Wells company in West Texas was purchased in the summer. The stores at Sunset Mall in San Angelo and South Plains Mall in Lubbock were both converted, while the third in downtown Lubbock was closed.[6]

In 1987, Dillard's purchased 26 of Joske's 27 stores in Texas and Arizona as well as the four unit Cain-Sloan chain in Nashville, Tennessee, from Allied Stores Corp. This deal gave Dillard's two major anchor locations at several malls in Texas and Arizona with many of the second locations being converted to a separate, expanded home and men's stores, a format that Dillard's utilized greatly, both to grow its store size cost effectively and to prevent competitors from gaining valuable real estate. Additionally the Joske's acquisition gave Dillard's entry into the Houston market.
Dillard's in 1988 acquired the former Selber Bros. clothing department store chain, founded in 1907 in Shreveport, Louisiana, which also had a few locations in Texas.[7]
In 1988, Dillard's purchased the three-unit Miller & Paine chain in Lincoln, Nebraska, as well as more significantly, a half-interest and operational control of The Higbee Co., based in Cleveland, Ohio, with partner Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd., of New Orleans, was purchased in 1989, bringing 18 units primarily in Louisiana, as well two former Diamond's units in Tucson, Arizona.
1990s acquisitions[edit]
The Ivey's chain of 23 stores in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina was acquired from BATUS in 1990. This was followed by the acquisition of eight Florida Gulf Coast stores from Maison Blanche Co. in 1991 (which had acquired them as Robinsons of Florida only a few years before). In 1992, the remaining interest in the Higbee's stores were acquired, as well as five Ohio stores from Horne's (as part of a legal settlement, Dillard's having canceled a 1988 deal to acquire the chain). Also in 1992, three stores from the Hess's chain liquidation (five other former Hess's were acquired in 1994), two E.M. Scarbrough's locations in Austin, Texas, two former Thalhimer's in South Carolina and Tennessee, a former Lord & Taylor store in Memphis, Tennessee and three former Belk-Lindsey stores in Florida were acquired by Dillard's. Except for two Belk of Columbia stores acquired in 1995, acquisitions were eschewed for several years until in early 1997 ten buildings in Florida were acquired from Mervyns, seven southern Virginia stores were purchased from Proffitt's (which had acquired them from Hess's in 1993), and the three suburban Macy's stores in Houston were absorbed.
Late 1990s[edit]
The deal-making culminated with the purchase of Mercantile Stores Co., Inc., in 1998. The purchase of this Fairfield, Ohio-based department store company brought several chains, including Bacon's, Castner Knott, de Lendrecie's, Gayfers, Glass Block, Hennessy's, J.B. White, Joslins, Lion Store, Maison Blanche, McAlpin's, Root's and The Jones Store. Dillard's sold 26 stores of the former Mercantile Stores to May Department Stores Co. and Saks Incorporated and traded an additional seven stores to Belk for nine of theirs in southern Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Overall this deal enabled Dillard's to enhance its position in several markets in the South, Midwest and Mountain states.
Also in 1998, the chain entered California, opening its first store in a former Weinstock's at Weberstown Mall in Stockton, California.[8] In 1999 Dillard's opened a store at Mall of Georgia near Atlanta, Georgia.
Recent events[edit]




Dillard’s in Fairview, Texas opened on March 10, 2010.


After the acquisition of Mercantile, Dillard's ceased expanding through acquisitions, although eight locations of the defunct Montgomery Ward in the Midwest, and four locations from ZCMI in Utah and Idaho were acquired in 2001.
In 2004, Dillard's store credit card operation, operated as Dillard's National Bank, was sold to GE Money Bank. Customers can now be issued Dillard's/American Express cards as well the traditional Dillard's store charge. These cards can be used at any store that accepts the American Express brand.
In 2005 Dillard's opened a store at Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2008, Dillard's closed their travel agency, Dillard's Travel, alongside all in-store locations due to economic conditions. Dillard's Travel previously operated in 43 of the 318 stores.[9][10]
Current operations[edit]

Map of Dillard's locations


The chain continues to expand and has recently added stores in non-traditional mall shopping centers. Currently, the largest Dillard's store at 365,000 square feet (33,000 m²) is located at Scottsdale Fashion Square, an enclosed super-regional mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. Within the Dallas area, the chain has two flagship stores with a 299,000-square-foot (27,800 m2) store at the Northpark Center in Dallas and a 310,000-square-foot (29,000 m2) store at the North East Mall in Hurst.[11] Its flagship store in the East Coast region, at 260,000 square feet (24,000 m2), is located in the MacArthur Center in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. The home store for the chain is in Little Rock; the divided store is located in the trend-conscious Park Plaza Mall, one of the city's oldest continuously operating shopping centers in its midtown section.
In several "upper-scale" locations - like Simon Malls-owned Midland Park Mall, Texas, or in locations where another acquired store existed before the merger, Dillards operates both Men's and Women's stores; both are located within the same mall but in separate, distinct "anchor" (locations). Dillard's also maintains separate Men's and Women's anchor stores at Cielo Vista Mall and Sunland Park Mall, both in El Paso, Texas; the Mall of Abilene in Abilene, Tx; the Battlefield Mall in Springfield, Missouri; Melbourne Square Mall in Melbourne, Florida; Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; First Colony Mall in Sugar Land, Texas (suburban Houston); South Plains Mall in Lubbock, TX; Westgate Mall in Amarillo, TX; Golden Triangle Mall in Denton, TX; Central Mall in Fort Smith, Arkansas; Lakeline Mall in Cedar Park, Texas (suburban Austin); Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio, (suburban Cleveland); Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas (suburban Kansas City); Towne West Square in Wichita, Kansas; Sikes Senter Mall in Wichita Falls, TX; Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Northpark Mall in Ridgeland, Mississippi; and the Frontier Mall in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The two Great Lakes Mall stores, however, have since consolidated into one, with the other, located around the corner from the Macy's, sitting empty with signs redirecting customers to the consolidated store.
At Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach, Florida, Dillard's operates three separate two-story buildings: Dillard's East, a men's/home store; Dillard's South, a children's/juniors store; and Dillard's West, a women's store.[12]

      Address: Dillard's Department Stores, 1600 Cantrell Road, Little
      Rock, Arkansas 72201; http://www.dillards.com.
    

      ■ William Dillard II began his career in 1967 at Dillard's,
      the company his father, William T., had founded in 1938 in Little Rock,
      Arkansas. Dillard's is known as an upscale department store chain
      and by 2004 ranked number three in the United States, with Dillard family
      members owning 99 percent of the voting stock and electing two-thirds of
      the company's directors.
    

      William Dillard II was named executive vice president in 1973, rising to
      the position of chief executive officer by 1998. He made his mark on the
      company almost immediately through the introduction of computers in the
      1970s. Dillard took the company through its largest acquisition with the
      $3 billion purchase of Mercantile Stores Company in 1998. Despite
      criticism from industry analysts that they risked becoming a discount
      chain, Dillard's also initiated its own brand of clothing in 2002
      to help reduce debt while increasing sales. Dillard was criticized for not
      being aggressive enough in slashing prices when inventory did not sell and
      possessing a weaker management style than his father. He and his younger
      brothers adamantly refused to sell the company despite falling sales and
      stock prices and open criticism from nonfamily stockholders.
    

      INHERITING THE GOOD AND BAD FROM A FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS
    

      Dillard grew up as the oldest son of a retailing pioneer. At the time of
      his birth, Dillard's had been operating for seven years.
      Dillard's father ran the company with an iron fist and groomed all
      five of his sons to take over management roles as they came of age. After
      receiving degrees in business from the University of Arkansas and Harvard,
      Dillard immediately began working for the family business, where he
      received all of his retail training under the watchful eye of his father.
    

      Many critics of Dillard's noted the family's penchant for
      keeping the status quo and not allowing anyone else into the
      family's inner circle of running the business. In 1991 
      
        Forbes
      
       referred to the family as insulated and private.
    

      Even though the company went public two years after Dillard began working
      there, its structure remained a dual-class stock, where the family owned
      the majority of voting stock yet retained a small percentage of the
      company. In 2000 the Dillard family owned 10 percent of the company but
      held 99 percent of the voting stock. They also kept control of the board
      by placing family members on it. The elder Dillard held the
      chairman's position until 1998, when he turned over the reins to
      his eldest son.
    

      As the retailing market changed in the 1990s, Dillard remained loyal to
      his father's example of holding on to inventory and waiting too
      long to mark down out-of-season items. When the company began losing
      profits steadily each quarter by the end of the decade, however, Dillard
      began to introduce new strategies in an effort to reduce debt and bring
      Dillard's back to the retail giant once dubbed in 1991 a company
      with "profit margins that would knock your eyes out" (as
      quoted in 
      
        Forbes
      
      , September 18, 2000).
    

      DILLARD MAKES STRIDES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY
    

      Dillard made his mark in the company by introducing data processing as
      early as 1973, when he became the executive vice president.
      Dillard's was at the forefront of computerizing purchase orders.
      Dillard was also praised for being a computer whiz long before other
      companies began using computers.
    

      In 1998 Dillard made a surprising move for the company, which had
      typically bought stores on the cheap. He made a
       bid for Mercantile Stores in 1998 for $3.1 billion in cash. Dillard won
      the bid, but analysts claimed the company paid too much, which caused
      Dillard's to accumulate a high level of debt. Dillard ended
      in-store promotions and stopped an easygoing return policy at Mercantile
      Stores. Both of those customer-friendly policies had been the hallmark of
      Mercantile. By 2002 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
       noted that the acquisition was disappointing and resulted in damaging the
      company's stock price. Dillard blamed the poor performance on
      losing time to consolidating Mercantile Stores into Dillard's.
    

      Dillard began in 2002 to make up for the Mercantile purchase by
      selectively buying one store at a time in malls where businesses had
      exited or closed. In some locations, this gave Dillard's two anchor
      stores within one mall, each one specializing in different departments.
      Dillard called this "a doubleheader." Dillard's led
      the industry with these doubleheader stores, with two anchor stores in 50
      different malls by May 2002.
    

      The ownership of real estate by Dillard's continued to be the
      company's strong point as it struggled to keep pace with the
      changes in the retail industry. Analysts noted that investors seemed more
      interested in the land holdings than in sales when profits plunged in 2002
      and 2003. Experts noted not only that Dillard has continued to make wise
      decisions on real estate but also that the location of the properties has
      been a positive for the company. By 2001 Dillard's owned 75 percent
      of its stores, making it a company with a strong book value, unlike other
      chains that lease most of their stores.
    

      DILLARD STARTS A PRIVATE LABEL
    

      With discount retailers taking business away from the malloriented stores
      such as Dillard's by the end of the 1990s, Dillard began making
      decisions that seemed aggressive compared with the strategies previously
      employed by the company. Developing a private brand of merchandise led to
      a rise in sales by 2002. When the brand was first introduced, many thought
      it would hurt Dillard's by making the stores more of a discount
      chain; others felt the move would improve sales. One industry insider said
      that Dillard's started its private-label program before many other
      chains, which helped them get a boost on the competition. Dillard was
      praised for offering customers a choice between the core brands and their
      own brand, which was discounted. Other analysts said that consumers are
      obsessed with known brand-name labels and criticized Dillard's for
      attempting to give consumers something they did not want to buy.
    

      Dillard told shareholders in 2002 that the company sought the perfect
      balance between the known labels and private ones. By 2003 the strategy
      had paid off, with the private label steadily increasing its profits to
      18.2 percent of total store sales. However, the old problem left over from
      the elder Dillard continued to plague the company. Large amounts of
      inventory and huge markdowns hit the gross profit margins hard. Insiders
      said the markdowns were so drastic because Dillard waited too long to make
      the decision to discount the overabundant inventory at the end of the
      season. Dillard's became desperate to move the merchandise and
      slashed prices too low. Despite increasing sales of the private label,
      this other strategy left the company in a sales slide by mid-2003.
    

      Along with its private label, Dillard also instituted a policy to help
      move merchandise faster at the end of the season. The movement of items
      out of the store helped stabilize the profit margins. Dillard increased
      the private-label merchandise and negotiated up-front vendor allowances. 
      
        Forbes
      
       noted in 2000 that Dillard's had made strides with these
      decisions. Dillard closed unprofitable stores while reducing staff. 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
       said in 2002 that these new strategies had finally taken hold to improve
      the net income despite dropped net sales. Dillard said in a press release,
      "We consider our accomplishments in the fourth quarter [fiscal year
      2002] to be solid affirmation that we are on the right track with our
      strategies" (March 11, 2002).
    

      PRIVATE EVEN WITH STOCKHOLDERS
    

      Dillard's career cannot be separated from the successes and
      failures of the company. Critics often lambasted the man and the company
      for the lack of communication with the media, industry analysts, and
      shareholders. 
      
        Forbes
      
       noted in an article in 2000 that Dillard refused to be interviewed for
      the story. He made it a policy never to comment on criticisms and
      speculations regarding the company.
    

      One of the shareholders did speak to 
      
        Forbes
      
       for the article, complaining about management's lack of response
      to written requests for information. Thomas Jackson, a managing director
      of Prudential Investment Corporation, was the second-largest shareholder
      in 2000, owning 9.2 percent of Dillard's stock. Jackson told 
      
        Forbes
      
       that even though he was disgusted with what he perceived as arrogance, he
      held on to his stock, hoping Dillard would make the decision to sell the
      company.
    

      When the founder of Dillard's died in 2002, many insiders
      speculated that his son would make the decision either to sell or to make
      significant changes in the policies governing the company. The speculation
      occurred because the elder Dillard was seen as the spiritual guide of the
      company despite his son's appointment as CEO in 1998. An editorial
      in 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
       in 2002 said that even Wall Street was betting the heirs would sell the
      company. Dillard, although reticent to speak to the media, had sent word
      through friends that the family remained committed to Dillard's and
      entertained no ideas of selling.
    

      Dillard said he kept shareholders informed on the company's status
      at the annual meetings and held conference calls
       with investors and any other interested parties, the media included, on a
      regular basis. He issued a statement after the 
      
        Forbes
      
       piece came out, noting that what some refer to as
      "snubbing" he called "fair disclosure." By
      2003, however, investors were concerned that Dillard had not participated
      in the last four conference calls held, despite the investors'
      request that Dillard be present. Robert Buchanan, an analyst for A. G.
      Edwards, told the America's Intelligence Wire on September 9, 2003,
      "In the interest of the shareholders he [Dillard] should sell the
      company." Analysts blamed Dillard's lack of forthrightness
      as one of the reasons that forecasting the earnings of the company was
      nearly impossible. This secretiveness kept Wall Street wary.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLES
    

      Analysts praised Dillard and his hands-on style of management during his
      early years as president. Nothing reached the floor for sale until Dillard
      had made a decision about it. In 1983 Dillard was praised for creating
      market dominance for the company through his computer system, which led to
      higher efficiency. However, criticisms regarding management's
      conservative approach to change began to surface despite the innovation in
      tracking merchandise through computerized files.
    

      What had once worked for Dillard's in the 1980s no longer helped,
      because the nature of retail stores changed in the 1990s. Dillard made
      some adjustments, but he remained steadfast to his father's
      original strategies even with dire predictions from industry analysts as
      of 2004.
    

      As Dillard began to change strategies toward private-label brands and
      real-estate acquisition, profits fluctuated for the decade from 1994 to
      2004. When the elder Dillard died in 2002, speculation that Dillard and
      his brothers would sell the company created ups and downs in stock
      valuations. While the changes Dillard instituted did help profit margins,
      some of the same criticisms of management's style remained.
    


        Forbes
      
       magazine charged in 2000 that Dillard hung on stubbornly to the belief
      that the family could handle the downturn in sales. The magazine said
      Dillard lacked his father's business sense. In 2003 analysts said
      that sales fell because the company had waited too long to lower prices on
      summer stock. By 2004 Moody's Investors Services expressed anxiety
      over the value of Dillard's performance and its ability to recover.

With Dillard’s, the consensus is that little to no training is provided and employees are often unprepared or under-equipped.Lack of training leads to no increase in self efficacy; therefore, workers are less motivatedHigh turnover rate causes low employee morale and a low sense of security.Need for achievement stifled due to lack of promotion opportunities.How to ImproveFirst there needs to be a clearly defined pay scale to ensure equity among employees. A training system that improves employee skill and thus increases self-efficacy should also be implemented.A new reward or commission based pay system should also be implemented for the sales force. “Rewards should be contingent on performance, and employees must perceive the link between the two. Regardless of how strong the relationship is, if individuals perceive it to be weak, the results will be low performance, a decrease in job satisfaction, and an increase in turnover and absenteeism.”Dillard'sAmanda Rae RodriguezMaribel SolisJose MendezArthur BarberTeam LionThank you for watchingFull transcriptMore presentations by

William T. Dillard II
Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerDillard's Inc.Little Rock, Arkansas
 


Bill Dillard, chair and chief executive officer of Dillard's Inc., is the oldest son
                     of retailing pioneer William T. Dillard, founder of Dillard Department Stores. He
                     was born in Nashville, Arkansas, on March 4, 1945.
                  
Bill Dillard began working part-time in his father's retail operations while still
                     in school. In 1966, he graduated from the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the
                     University of Arkansas with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration as an
                     accounting major. Two years later, he earned a Master of Business Administration from
                     Harvard University.
                  
He began his career at Dillard's in 1967 and joined the company's board of directors
                     the same year. From 1977 to 1998, Dillard served as president and chief operating
                     officer of the company. He succeeded his father as chief executive officer in 1998
                     and was named chair of the company in 2002. He has been a member of the boards of
                     directors of Acxiom Corp. since 1988 and Barnes & Noble since 1993.
                  
In April 2015, Dillard received the University of Arkansas Chancellor's Medal. He
                     served on the university's Campaign Steering Committee and the Corporate and Foundation
                     Relations Committee of the Campaign for the Twenty-First Century and now serves as
                     a member of the Executive, Campaign Steering, and Corporate and Foundation Relations
                     committees for Campaign Arkansas. He is a former member of the Dean's Circle and Dean's
                     Executive Advisory Board of the Walton College and has been a member of the Razorback
                     Foundation for more than five decades.
                  
His father, William Dillard Sr., was inducted into the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame with the inaugural class in
                     1999.

William Dillard III
Vice President
Dillard's Inc. Little Rock 





William Dillard III
			Bill Dillard III entered the family-controlled department store business in a Phoenix regional division in January 1994. Along the way to becoming a vice president of Dillard's Inc., he gained international experience in Hong Kong at William E. Connor Associates, a sourcing firm for manufacturing and retail companies. He has also worked in buying, sales management, product development and merchandising, giving him the opportunity to put his legendary grandfather's philosophy to work: "Business without integrity isn't good business and in the long run won't be successful."Dillard said he has also "more and more come to realize we're all created uniquely and creatively" and believes a manager's role is to bring out those qualities in employees to full positive impact.Dillard has worked with Habitat for Humanity and the American Heart Association's Heart Walk. He's also part of a newly formed "common cause" community group at Fellowship Bible Church and supports Young Life.Born and reared in Little Rock, Dillard graduated from Hall High School and attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a bachelor's in history in 1993. He also earned an MBA from Kellogg Graduate School of Business at Northwestern University.
