 TX-002HR (Oral Progesterone)

TherapeuticsMD temporarily stopped trial.*
WHAT IT IS:
TX-002HR is an investigational progesterone product under consideration for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. This natural progesterone formulation does not contain the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil, which is contained in currently available FDA-approved oral progesterone formulations. The product is chemically identical to the hormone that naturally occurs in a woman’s body.
TX-002HR has completed a pivotal PK study, and we are reevaluating the phase 3 clinical development program.
DEVELOPMENT PHASE: PHASE 3 UNDER CONSIDERATION
In July 2014, we temporarily suspended enrollment in the Spry Trial, and in October 2014, we temporarily stopped it in order to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. We intend to update the phase 3 protocol to, among other things, target only those women with secondary amenorrhea due to polycystic ovarian syndrome and to amend the primary endpoint of the trial.
ABOUT AMENORRHEA:
Amenorrhea is the absence of a menstrual period in a woman of reproductive age. Secondary amenorrhea (menstruation cycles ceasing) is often caused by hormonal disturbances from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or from premature menopause or intrauterine scar formation. It is defined as the absence of menses for three months in a woman with previously normal menstruation.

 Hormone Therapy – Medical Overview

MENOPAUSE
Menopause is diagnosed after a woman has not had a menstrual period for twelve consecutive months. At this time, her ovaries have stopped releasing eggs and have largely stopped producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. According to The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), “Most women experience menopause between ages 40 and 58. The average age is 51.”1 A woman may experience menopause as early as her thirties, brought on by medical interventions such as having a hysterectomy or undergoing chemotherapy.2 The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that hot flashes and vaginal dryness are the most common menopause symptoms – with as many as 75% of menopausal women experiencing hot flashes.3Postmenopausal women may experience vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), a component of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). VVA is a medical condition caused by loss of estrogen after menopause. One of the most bothersome symptoms of VVA is dyspareunia (vaginal pain from sexual activity). Additional symptoms may include vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, and painful urination. Approximately 50% of menopausal women or 32 million women in the United States experience VVA symptoms, yet only about 7% (2.3 million) of these women use prescription treatment.4
ESTROGEN AND ESTROGEN/PROGESTIN THERAPY
Hormone therapy has been used for more than one-half century for the management of menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms (VMS – hot flushes, night sweats) and postmenopausal symptoms associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA).
Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)
Estrogen Therapy
The use of estrogen alone therapy is used in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor (VMS) symptoms associated with menopause. These symptoms, appearing in postmenopausal women, are called hot flashes or hot flushes. The severity of VMS symptoms may range from:

Mild – the sensation of feeling hot without sweating
Moderate – the sensation of feeling hot, accompanied by sweating, and able to maintain activity
Severe – the sensation of feeling hot, accompanied by sweating, and needing to cease activity

Prescription estrogen-alone therapy may be recommended for women who experience moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and have had a hysterectomy.
Estrogen/Progestin Therapy 
Estrogen/progestin therapy may be recommended for women who experience VMS symptoms, particularly severe hot flashes, and have not had a hysterectomy. The addition of progestin is used to help counteract possible adverse effects of estrogen alone on the endometrium of women with their uterus intact.
Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy (VVA)
Estrogen Therapy 
Estrogen therapy alone is also used locally in the treatment of moderate to severe vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms associated with menopause. VVA symptoms may include:

Vaginal dryness
Dyspareunia (vaginal pain associated with sexual intercourse)
Dysuria (painful urination)
Vaginal itching or irritation
Bleeding after sexual intercourse

 TX-001HR (Oral Estradiol + Progesterone)

WHAT IT IS:
TX-001HR is a novel combination of 17ß-estradiol and progesterone using SYMBODA technology, under investigation for treating vasomotor symptoms (VMS) related to menopause. TX-001HR is believed to be the first and only combination drug product candidate designed to replace the 17ß-estradiol and progesterone hormones the ovary has nearly stopped producing. About VMS
DEVELOPMENT PHASE: PHASE 3 –THE REPLENISH TRIAL
The purpose of the Replenish Trial is to evaluate an investigational bio-identical medication that may help reduce the frequency and severity of VMS symptoms, particularly daily hot flashes and night sweats often experienced during menopause.
The Phase 3 Replenish Trial was fully enrolled Q3 2015. Topline data anticipated Q4 2016 – Q1 2017.


Replenish Trial Study Design Summary

 Projected number of subjects
 1,750


 Projected number of US sites
 ~110


 Treatment arms (n=400/arm)




Estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg
Estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg
Estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg
Estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg
Placebo






 Length of study
 12-month study for endometrial safety with 12-week vasomotor substudy endpoints


 Endpoints




Vasomotor substudy: number and severity of hot flashes (Weeks 4 and 12)
Endometrial safety: incidence of endometrial hyperplasia (12 months)







ABOUT VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS (VMS)
It is estimated that more than 90% of women experience VMS, particularly frequent hot flashes and night sweats during menopause. Most rate the severity of their hot flashes as moderate to severe.1

Proprietary TechnologyResulting in novel drug candidates in key women’s healthcare categories

SYMBODA, meaning “similar to the body,” is a solubilized female hormone technology for formulation of estradiol and progesterone identical in chemical structure to the estradiol and progesterone that women naturally produce.GROUND BREAKING AND UNIQUESYMBODA technology is unique because it enables partial or complete solubilization of progesterone or estradiol into medium-chain oils often derived from coconut oil. This allows for the production of cohesive, stable formulations, and provides content uniformity and accuracy of dosing.WELL RESEARCHED AND COMPLIANTTherapeuticsMD is leveraging this leading-edge technology to create new bio-identical drug forms and combinations that meet FDA uniformity and stability requirements.PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSSYMBODA underlies two natural bio-identical hormone investigational products currently in late-stage development at TherapeuticsMD and several of its earlier-stage investigational products.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
