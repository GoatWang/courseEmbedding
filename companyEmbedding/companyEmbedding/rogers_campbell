BiographyEmily Rogers focuses her practice on complex product liability defense and appellate work. She has a particular interest in catastrophic personal injury cases and is currently working on a variety of matters in these areas.
While in law school, Emily worked as a judicial law clerk to the Honorable David W. McKeague of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  In this position, she researched and drafted bench memoranda on various civil and criminal issues and gained an inside perspective of federal litigation and the federal court system.
In addition to her work with Judge McKeague, Emily was drawn to litigation through her participation in legal clerkships with both the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia and the Washtenaw County Office of the Public Defender in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  In these positions, she gained early litigation and courtroom experience by representing clients in all stages of the criminal process.
Although Emily has made her home in Pennsylvania, she remains an avid University of Michigan fan.  Go Blue!Representative Experience:
