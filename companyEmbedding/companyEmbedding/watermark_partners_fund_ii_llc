Property Tour Investor's Recap



6/19/2017




0 Comments



 

​The Watermark Partners leadership team want to thank the 40+ investors that participated in our recent investor presentation in Ann Arbor, and the 25+ investors that attended our investor tour that day.  We all enjoyed the opportunity to get to know you better and appreciate the effort that you made to be there.We are delighted to share one of our investor attendee's analysis of Watermark below.  


 “Super impressed with the team, with the properties, with the thoughtfulness they gave to our questions. I especially liked their balanced approach to meeting the tenants needs (creating a good product) while extracting as much value from the properties as possible. The region is more nuanced than expected. Lots of opportunity to do good for tenants while making more outsized returns. Very solid team.------A few things that really struck me through the day:    • While the fund is concentrated in one region of the country & on one asset class, within that there is an interesting amount of diversity found in the fund    • Demographics: Some section 8 housing (they can dial up or down and in some places like Toledo, OH there are new funds that increase the amount available for supplementing rent), some that cater to university post graduates, some to older tenants and some to regular blue collar folks. I really liked the nuance between the different cities in the fund. Like Detroit there are depressed values, but unlike Detroit there are some really good demographics that make solid tenants.    • Size of apartments from dozen or so up to 100's.    • They have a good strategy in buying up apartments near each other with an eye for making them attractive as a package for institutional investors.    • They are strong operators. Spent a good bit of time with Stewart Beal in the car between stops. He is a nose to the grind kind of guy who obviously has great attention to detail (was obvious from the many questions he answered about everything from payment collection, to rent management software, to process for handling tough tenants, to litigation process, to screening tenants, etc. Justin seems equally so (MTH Property Management).    • They are a balanced team. Stewart is Mr. operations. Elan knows how to manage the banks for the all important good terms, John is really deep in acquisition and getting all off market deals, Tom is deeply connected to the institutional side (former Wall Street). Their new additions for market research and accounting seem to be smart moves. Each had a good grasp on the business (even though Brad was just 2 weeks on the job)    • They are leveraging their research not just for investor relations/due diligence but as a tool to get better loan terms. Their Toledo OH package has really been a hit with the city & the banks.    • They are thoughtful on how the spend the money. Adding Brad & Steve only happened after they received enough CoC flow to afford adding them.     • They don't waste money on investors. We had the crappiest bagels and I was joking with another investor that this proved they were not wasteful because those were the cheapest bagels I think anyone could find.    • I had mentioned to Tom that he should check out Crowd Street for Business platform a few weeks ago -- they are already in beta test with the integration to provide investors with a nice portal to manage all communications. They now have over 150 investors so Tom is really thankful as this will allow him to scale. BTW, that product is pretty cheap (can't share the amount but I asked him personally)    • I got to meet Tom's in-laws, some of the partner's families, Stewart's father, etc. It is a bit more soft, but you do get a feeling about a team when you spend time with them in a social setting.    • While I am sure they carefully chose the apartments for us to see, it was clear that they do simple things to make the quality of life a bit better for the tenants (like landscaping, paving, clean apartments, etc.) It was interesting to watch Stewart go out of his way when I don't think anyone was watching to pick up a piece of paper that was somewhere on the property    • They very rarely compete on offers. They rely on pocket deals or straight deals with sellers. Stewart has been in the area a long time. The other two management companies have strong relationships as well. Since they have never failed to close a deal they find deals come to them.     • They are definitely strong negotiators on the purchase side.     • They look for deals that have a bonus room. One funny story: at the end of a walk through the agent said "do you want to see the house too?" The house wasn't listed but was part of the deal so they got a bonus house to rent. Another one: in one apartment complex there was a room not on the rent roll. Had a sofa + TV. Turns out the owner would tell his wife he was going out but instead go to that room and watch TV :-) In most of their deals they find unrealized opportunities    • They do nice stuff to the apartments but they don't do too much. They seem to have a good sense on what they can put off that doesn't sacrifice livability.    • No B.S. detectors went off. No slimy sales pitches. Just seems like smart guys who have found a great niche in the market. Healthy fear of leverage, but use it within bounds, get good long term rates, etc.End of the day I was very happy that I am in the fund.  I certainly came away with a much more nuanced view of that region of Michigan & Ohio.”

﻿Expanding into Lansing: Executing the Watermark Strategy



		12/21/2016
	



		0 Comments
	


 

      Watermark Partners Real Estate is excited to share that the fund just closed on a 55 unit apartment complex in Lansing, Michigan called Regency Townhomes.  Located in the state's capital, with the third lowest unemployment rate in the state and a growth in multiple sectors outpacing state and national averages (led by state government, Michigan State University, and the healthcare and manufacturing sectors), this first acquisition in Lansing is the result of the Watermark team’s execution of our core strategy.As this case exemplifies, our strategy remains to focus on in-depth new market analysis of smaller Midwestern cities with consistent employment (universities/hospitals/state or municipal government), identification of best-in-class on the ground partners with inside knowledge of the local market, and purchase off-market and poorly managed properties that will benefit from our “value add” approach. This strategy will allow the fund to continue to expand its footprint throughout the Midwest and diversify the portfolio for investors without sacrificing quality and performance

Your Note Buying Solution












We are Watermark
Watermark Capital is a New York based loan acquisition firm. Our priority is to keep families in their homes while providing a profitable outcome for the fund. We specialize in the purchase and distribution of mortgage notes and mortgage loan portfolios that are purchased and traded on the secondary loan market.





What do we actually do?
We help investors succeed
             
Watermark Capital Partners LLC is a New York based mortgage investment fund that buys distressed whole loans from financial institutions, hedge funds and private equity firms that specialize in note buying at significant discounts off of the outstanding balances owed on the loans. The notes are secured by a lien interest in the property perfected by a mortgage or deed of trust. They are purchased at a discounted percentage of the current market value of the property. We then attempt to either assist the homeowner to start paying again with various incentives or pursue foreclosure to then be able to liquidate the asset at a profit. In order to purchase note portfolios at the severely discounted rates available because of relationships and expertise that Watermark Capital has developed to source these assets WMC is seeking qualified investors to partner with. The current market conditions support this unique opportunity to purchase bulk quantity non-performing notes and improve the quality of the collateral. WMC has the knowledge and expertise to source the notes, manage the work out and re-performance process-otherwise known as ‘home retention’.
             
The network of specialty service providers contracted with WMC has the capability to assist in the management of this process and fulfill the necessary licensing and compliance requirements that are mandatory of lenders’ servicers when dealing with consumers. These firms have the necessary licenses to satisfy all of the federal and state requirements recently implemented to protect consumers from egregious lenders and servicers. The opportunity to net a high yield return with relatively low risk exists because these notes are purchased with a - secured lien on real property - at loan to value ratios that are considered very conservative by private lending standards. There are combinations of economic and legislative factors creating this window of opportunity for significant above market returns to be earned by investors purchasing pools of distressed mortgage notes.
             
Above all, Watermark strives to treat every homeowner with dignity and respect. Through this philosophy and business model we have been able to turn non-performing mortgage notes into performing loans which creates revenue for our company and funds the preferred returns we offer our investors.
