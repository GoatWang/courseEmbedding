Sture Gordon Olsson


Obituary
Condolences




























WEST POINT - Sture Gordon Olsson, age 87, departed this life on Sept. 10, 2007. He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Anne Shirley Carter Olsson, M.D.; his son, Charles Elis Olsson and his wife, Dudley Percy Olsson; three daughters, Lisa Olsson Everett and her husband, Clint Everett; Anne Olsson Loebs and her husband, Grant Loebs; Inga Olsson Rogers and her husband, William Rogers; and four grandchildren, Elizabeth Lanier Olsson; Maja Percy Olsson; John Gregory Loebs; and Sarah Kristina Loebs. Sture Olsson's life was characterized by his dedication to his family, a long and distinguished career with Chesapeake Corporation, military service to his country, and active support of many educational and civic organizations.In 1942, Olsson received his B.S. in mechanical engineering from the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Virginia. After a brief tour of duty as a private in the Marine Corps, he was transferred to the Navy, where he served as a lieutenant (jg) until he was discharged in 1946. Shortly after his return from overseas, Olsson joined Chesapeake Corporation. The company was founded in 1918 by his father, Elis Olsson, who was an engineer by trade and recognized worldwide as a pioneer in the paper industry.From Olsson's initial position as a project engineer for Chesapeake, he rose through the ranks to president and chairman of the board until his retirement as chairman in 1994. During his career, Chesapeake grew from a single pulp and paper mill in West Point into a Fortune 500 diversified paper and packaging company in the kraft products, tissue and packaging businesses."Sture Olsson was a pillar in our industry and his community. His commitments to sound ethics in business, technical innovation and stewardship of the environment set high benchmarks for American industry," said Andrew J. Kohut, president and chief executive officer of Chesapeake Corporation.Organizations that benefited from Olsson's philanthropic leanings often honored him for his leadership and service. He served as vice chairman and director of the American Paper Institute, Inc.; director of Citizens and Farmers Bank and C&F Financial Corporation; director of Crestar Bank (now SunTrust Bank); chairman and director of the Fourdrinier Kraft Board Institute; director of the National Association of Manufacturers; founding trustee of the North Carolina State Pulp and Paper School; president and director of the National Paperboard Association; vestryman of St. John's Episcopal Church; trustee of St. Margaret's School; chairman of the Virginia Equine Educational Foundation; president and director of the Virginia Manufacturers Association; director of the Virginia Forestry Association and the Virginia Forestry Educational Foundation; and member of the board of visitors for the Virginia Military Institute.Olsson remained especially active throughout his life in supporting his alma mater, the University of Virginia. He underwrote scholarships, fellowships, endowed professorships, special academic programs and numerous capital projects. Additionally, he was one of the founding sponsors of the Darden School of Business at the University, which houses the Olsson Center for Applied Ethics. In recognition of his support of the Engineering School, the applied math and computer science building was named Olsson Hall.Another educational institution to which Olsson was devoted was Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va., from which he graduated in 1938. He supported the School in many ways, including establishing a scholarship, numerous professorships and a faculty sabbatical program. He served two terms on Episcopal's Board of Trustees and was named Trustee Emeritus. In 1992, Episcopal High School honored Olsson with its highest honor, the Distinguished Alumnus Award, for his many years of service to the School."Sture Olsson's contribution to the quality of life in West Point has been enormous. He was especially committed to first class education and health care. Through his energy, intelligence, and influence, he set the standard for personal and corporate commitment to our community. We have lost a great leader and a greater friend," said West Point Mayor, James H. Hudson, III.Olsson was decorated with the Swedish Royal Order of the North Star in 1979. Additionally, he was awarded one of the first Distinguished Citizen awards by the Robert E. Lee Council of Boy Scouts of America in 1988. The award is given to individuals who have exemplified in their daily lives the principles of citizenship fostered by the Boy Scouts of America.Olsson was born in Richmond, Va., in 1920. He lived in West Point, Va., for most of his life. Olsson was the first American citizen in his family. His parents, Elis and Signe Maria Granberg Olsson were Swedish immigrants. His brother and sister, Carl Olsson and Inga Olsson Nylander were likewise born out of the country and later became naturalized American citizens.Sture Olsson will be remembered by family and friends for his belief in hard work, his success in growing Chesapeake Corporation into a Fortune 500 corporate leader, and for his many contributions to the community of West Point and the Commonwealth of Virginia.A memorial service will be held at St. John's Episcopal Church, 916 Main St., West Point, Va., at 11 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 13. The family will receive friends at Romancoke Farm following the service. Interment will be private.
