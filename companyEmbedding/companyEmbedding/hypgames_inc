It has the feel of a season long format as you collect players to use and reuse but the perspective and functionality of a daily format. I like the season/campaign mode as it makes you look at your roster in some nontraditional ways. A bit overwhelming at first but once you get rolling it kinda sucks you in. It'd be great to have something to play for like cash or gift cards, but even without it I still find myself trying to improve my rank every day.
