He made a life making maps, but at crucial times, John Peter Walker, a mapmaker from Natchez country, lost his way.
(Second in Two-Part Series)
John Peter Walker left Natchez country in 1800 for Philadelphia, where he was employed by Andrew Ellicott to draw maps as a result of his survey of the new boundary line between the U.S. and Spain.
Ellicott was the American Boundary Commissioner in charge of marking the line along the 31st parallel beginning about 60 miles south of Natchez on the east side of the Mississippi River. Walker, at 17, was hired by Ellicott in 1798 to help survey the boundary. Pleased with Walker's work, Ellicott asked Walker to return with him to Philadelphia to make the maps.
Once there, Walker entered classes at Philadelphia Academy, which became the University of Pennsylvania. He studied the English language and mathematics. He wrote home to his father in Natchez: 
"I am presently studying Astronomy. I have went through Navigation and Surveying. In a couple of weeks I shall begin Algebra. I am first" in a class of more than 100. He said he spent his evenings studying modern Europe.

Yes, but we use smartphones and tablets in limited situations with standard surveying technology tools.



Not so much. It is often time consuming or complex to link smartphones and/or tablets to the surveying tools we use in the field.



No. Either our tools don’t provide a way to link, or we have chosen not to link to smartphones or tablets.

        Stanley Nelson: The exile of John Peter Walker
    


Stanley Nelson
Sentinel Editor

In the early 19th century, surveyor John Peter Walker died while in political exile in Spain. His banishment abroad can be traced back to his days in Concordia when he was the chief surveyor for the Spanish.Walker’s career began when Andrew Ellicott hired him as a chain bearer on a survey crew.Then the foremost cartographer in the United States, Ellicott was the American Boundary Commissioner in charge of marking the line established by treaty along the 31st parallel separating the U.S. and Spanish Florida. Work began shortly after Congress created Mississippi Territory in 1798.
The new boundary began about 50 miles as the crow flies south of Natchez on the east side of the Mississippi River and continued east to the Atlantic. U.S. 64 South crosses that line that today separates Wilkinson County, Miss., (below Woodville) and West Feliciana, La., (above St. Francisville).Pleased with Walker's work and thinking one of his daughters might find the young man promising husband material, Ellicott asked Walker to go with him to Philadelphia to produce maps and charts resulting from the survey and soon due the U.S. Government. (A romance failed to blossom.)Once there, Walker entered classes at Philadelphia Academy, better known today as the University of Pennsylvania. He often wrote home to his father in Natchez."I am presently studying Astronomy,” he explained in one letter. “I have went through Navigation and Surveying. In a couple of weeks I shall begin Algebra. I am first" in a class of more than 100. He said he spent his evenings studying modern Europe.One of the most impressive products of the boundary work was a 6 foot-2 inch tin map, which didn’t survive long. When the British bombed Washington during the War of 1812, this map was destroyed.Scraping by on pennies and waiting for the American government to pay him for his work, Walker learned that Spain had not only paid its boundary employees on time, but had provided them bonuses and lavished great praise on their work. And then unsettling news arrived.In 1802, the new governor of Mississippi Territory, W.C.C. Claiborne, fired Walker’s father, who had worked as a legislative clerk and for Mississippi’s first governor Winthrop Sargent.Out of money, John Peter Walker returned home in fall of 1802, his dreams of traveling abroad crushed. The slow pay for his boundary work and the political changes soured Walker on the United States.NEW LIFE IN CONCORDIAThe Walker family made an economic decision at that point. They crossed the river to Concordia to go to work for the Spanish government under Captain Jose Vidal. At the same time, John Walker apparently made a philosophical and political decision as well. Now, this son of an English father and French mother, became Juan Pedro Walker, and identified himself as a servant of Spain. It was in Concordia Parish that he first began to sign his name as Juan Pedro Walker.Walker quickly became the official surveyor of Concordia, spending much of his time surveying property bordering the Mississippi and lakes Concordia and St. John.In 1803, the Spanish sent Walker to Nacogdoches, Texas, to oversee the construction of a church. The Spanish liked what they saw in Walker. He talents were many, but his promising skills as a cartographer were unmatched. It didn’t hurt that he spoke three languages and that he understood how the Spanish bureaucracy worked.But by August 1803, just as things were looking up, the Americans stepped on his toes again.News reached Concordia of the Louisiana Purchase. Spanish Concordia would soon become American Concordia. Walker was devastated. He moved to Spanish lands west of the Sabine River.For the next years of his life, Walker traveled throughout Mexico and what is now the American Southwest surveying for the Spanish. He made field notes. He made maps.In the spring of 1805, he directed a military school in Mexico. The next year he was sent back to Nacogdoches as the Spanish and Americans faced off in a border dispute along the Sabine River. In 1807, Walker was appointed as the host of American Lt. Zebulon Pike during Pike's exploration of the Southwest. He also served as interpreter. Pike had crossed into Spanish territory, maybe purposely, and was detained for a few weeks by Spanish authorities.CESAR & THE NOLAN PARTYPrior to Pike's detainment, Walker came into contact with a slave named Cesar, who had served as Indian interpreter under Gov. Sargent's administration in Natchez. Cesar had joined horse hunter Philip Nolan’s fourth and final expedition to Spanish Texas to catch wild horses, tame them, and then drive them home to American Natchez for sale.The Spanish had warned Nolan against this fourth venture as relations between Spain and the U.S. fell apart. A Spanish company caught up with the Nolan party in east-central Texas. Nolan was killed in a gunfight, the only casualty.Cesar and almost two-dozen surviving members of the expedition were captured, tried and imprisoned. The fate of most isn't known. One was executed.Walker had known Cesar in Natchez and had worked with him on the line before Sargent recruited Cesar as an Indian interpreter. Walker and Cesar renewed what had been a friendship in Natchez and lived together in Mexico for a period of time.‘WITHOUT ANY MEANS’





In 1811, Walker's path, however, took a revolutionary turn. This idealistic young man, now 31, supported the independence movement in Mexico led by Father Hidalgo. Subsequently Walker was arrested and jailed by the very Spaniards he had long served. For the next six years, he continued to survey and make maps although he was technically under arrest and to be tried for his seditious actions.Spanish authorities later ruled evidence too scant to convict or exonerate him. Instead, they decided he should be permanently exiled to Spain where he could appeal his case. From there, he wrote a letter home in 1817.When Robert Dabney Calhoun was writing his history of Concordia Parish, published in 1931, a Walker descendant, State Representative G.P. Whittington of Alexandria, visited Calhoun at his office in the old town of Vidalia along the riverfront. Whittington, an historian, showed Calhoun the letter Walker had written home to family: "I am at present … without any means, except a small quantity of purse money assigned to me by the Captain General until the determination of the Court for my existence."Neither Whittington nor the Walker descendants knew what the letter meant. They also didn't know their relative’s fate.In Spain, Walker was allowed to argue an appeal of his sentence. But he lost. The crown issued its ruling -- Walker could never leave Spain. He would never see his family again.While the Spanish provided him a small government stipend on which to live, in exile he was forbidden to live in any port city or near a seat of government. A home along the sea might tempt him to escape back to America. And the Spanish didn't want him around any government seat for fear that his revolutionary thinking exposed in Mexico might be reborn in Spain.He died a decade later in 1828 at the age of 47.Historian Elizabeth Johns – (“The Riddle of Mapmaker Juan Pedro Walker,” Essays on the History of North American Discovery and Exploration, 1988) – put together the details of Walker’s life as a Spaniard. She wrote that Walker's "field notes attests the beginning of scientific mapping in the trans-Mississippi west and specifically Texas, decades before the U.S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers began the process ... anew."WALKER BROTHERSJohn Peter Walker’s brothers, Peter Celestine Walker and Joseph Marshall Walker, also played roles in the early history of Concordia.Peter was a surveyor and an attorney. He also was Concordia's first prosecutor.Joseph owned part of Whitehall Plantation for several years, served as a Justice of the Peace and was a member of the Police Jury. In 1817 he left Concordia for Rapides Parish where he was elected to the legislature and later served as Louisiana State Treasurer.In 1846, Joseph Marshall Walker was elected the 13th governor of Louisiana.

Follow the expoits of land surveyor John Peter Walker as he works with Andrew Ellicott to mark the new Spanish-American boundary line east of the Mississippi River following the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo and then goes on to become one of the first to map the American Southwest.
(First in a Two-Part Series)
 
by Stanley Nelson
In Robert Dabney Calhoun's 1931 book on the history of Concordia Parish, a paragraph in Chapter 2, Page 15, revealed a riddle. In this space, Calhoun wrote about Concordia's first official land surveyor, a man named John Peter Walker, the son of a prominent early Natchez resident and the brother of a Louisiana governor.
At some point before Calhoun finished the book, he was visited by Louisiana Rep. G. P. Whittington of Alexandria, who was also an historian, and a descendant of the Walker family. During that visit, Whittington provided Calhoun a titillating piece of information on the Walkers.
He relayed the story that John Peter Walker, this early surveyor in Spanish Concordia, had joined the Spanish army in Mexico and Texas, ascended to the rank of lieutenant and was involved in the detention of Lt. Zebulon Pike during Pike's exploration of the southwest in the early 1800s. Calhoun also wrote that Walker had been involved briefly in a plan to drive wild horses, once tamed, from east Texas through Rapides and Concordia to market in Natchez country.
Rep. Whittington had in his possession a letter dated March 10, 1817, and sent by John Walker from Cadiz, Spain, which said: "I am at present in this City without any means, except a small quantity of purse money assigned to me by the Captain General until the determination of the Court for my existence."

BYOD

Bring your own device is a growing trend. Does it work in the field for land surveyors?



Yes, we use smartphones and tablets with our standard surveying technology tools.



Yes, but we use smartphones and tablets in limited situations with standard surveying technology tools.



Not so much. It is often time consuming or complex to link smartphones and/or tablets to the surveying tools we use in the field.



No. Either our tools don’t provide a way to link, or we have chosen not to link to smartphones or tablets.
