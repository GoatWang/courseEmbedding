Here’s what Joey has to say about his presets, “My presets are designed for travelers by a traveler, no matter where you are. Tested in the deepest days of winter, all the way to the scorch of the summer sun. My presets will give a new and exciting kick to your photos.”
Start editing with these clean presets from Joey Speers.

12 Lightroom Presets
Warm/Cool Moody Looks
Vibrant Colors
Travel/Adventure
Free Help Files and Support

This product is compatible with Lightroom 4-6 and Lightroom CC. Lightroom Presets are compatible with RAW and JPEG photos.
Included in this package are twelve custom Adobe Lightroom Presets. Here are some details about how these filters will work on your photos:

JS #1 : Slightly crushed greens and deep darks for a moody affect.
JS #2 : Deep blacks and faded color for a rustic look.
JS #3 : Bright whites to bring the life of winter back into the photo.
JS #4 : A warm boost to your colors
JS #5 : Your perfect preset for sky high photos. Bringing out the deep greens of the forest.
JS #6 : Add a gloom to your photo.
JS #7 : Flipped hues, attracting your eyes to the colors.
JS #8 : Vibrant and electric water preset
JS #9 : A slight warmth and deep blacks to add to your landscape photos.
JS #10 : A cool but natural look for your landscapes with “cooler temperature” settings.
