INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.  (a)        Aggregate
Beneficial Ownership:  As of the date of this Report, the
Reporting Persons beneficially owned the following securities of the Issuer:
  Name  Title of Security  Amount  Percentage of Shares of Common
      Stock* Gregg Sedun  Common Stock  15,065,570(1) 6.2% GJS Capital Corp.  Common Stock  15,065,570(1) 6.2% *   Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security
      includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
      arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i)
      voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of
      shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or
      direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be
      beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share
      the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition,
      shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has
      the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option)
      within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In
      computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares
      outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned
      by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition
      rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as
      shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual
      ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common
      stock actually outstanding on the date of this Schedule 13D Statement. As
      of September 30, 2016, the Issuer had 243,859,204 shares of common stock,
      issued and outstanding.(1)   The number of shares listed as beneficially owned by Mr.
      Sedun and GJS consists of 15,065,570 common shares held directly by GJS
      Capital Corp:(b)   Power to Vote and Dispose of the Issuer
    Shares:Page 5 of 8 CUSIP No. 78033P
      10 1    Gregg Sedun may be deemed to share voting and dispositive
      power with respect to all of the securities of the Issuer beneficially
      owned by the Reporting Persons.   (c)   Transactions Effected During the Past 60
    Days:     The information required by this Item 5(c) is provided in
      Items 3 and 4 of this information statement.   (d)   Right of Others to Receive Dividends or Proceeds of
      Sale:     No person has the right to receive or the power to direct
      the receipt of dividends or the proceeds from the sale of the Shares other
      than the Reporting Persons.   (e)   Date Ceased to be the Beneficial Owner of More Than
      Five Percent:     Not Applicable.ITEM
6.               
CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO
SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.  Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, GJS has agreed to
extend the previously advanced $150,000 Loan (the Principal). The loan bears
interest at a rate of 6% per annum, compounded annually and now has a maturity
date of December 31, 2016 (the Maturity Date"). The Issuer settled $329,000 in
outstanding indebtedness in exchange for 15,065,570 shares of common stock of
the Issuer. Also, the Issuer has agreed to transfer 1,400,000 of its 1,600,000
common shares of Gainey Capital Corp. to GJS. GJS represented that it was not a
"US Person" as that term is defined by Regulation S of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.  At any time prior to the Maturity Date, on 65 days notice, GJS
may elect to receive units (each a Unit") of the Issuer in exchange for any
portion of the Principal outstanding on the basis of one Unit for each $0.05 of
indebtedness converted (the Unit Conversion Option"). Each Unit consists of one
share of the Issuers common stock and one warrant to purchase an additional
share of the Issuer's common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for two years
from the date of issuance. If GJS exercises the Unit Conversion Option, GJS will
forgive the interest that that accrued on the converted portion of the
Principal.  If GJS exercises the Unit Conversion Option, GJS will receive a
net profits interest (the Net Profits Interest) on any future profits received
by Issuer that are derived from the Issuers process for the recovery of
precious metals from coal ash and other materials (the Technology) on the
basis of 1% of the Issuers net profits for every $10,000 of converted
Principal. The Net Profits Interest will terminate when GJS receives eight times
the amount of converted Principal.  The Issuer also agreed that in circumstances where Mr. Sedun
introduces sub-licensees or joint venture partners (Partners) to the Issuer
for the purpose of using the Issuers Technology, the Issuer shall pay 20% of
the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from the Partners (the Partnership
Interest) to Mr. Sedun. The Issuer is under no obligation to enter into an
agreement or terminate any future agreement with any Partners.  ITEM
