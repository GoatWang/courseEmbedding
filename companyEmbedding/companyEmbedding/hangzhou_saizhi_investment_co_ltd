Buyer's Feedback


Easy Sourcing helps me trade easily!
As a new member to Made-in-China.com, I posted my first request on Easy Sourcing one month ago. Fortunately, I received the first quality quotation from supplier - Changzhou Ji****Co., Ltd. within 2 hours after submission! Finally I ordered Electronic Transformer from the supplier. In the past I had to spend several days to find a satisfied supplier. Now, I only need a few hours!

I have found several qualified suppliers through Easy Sourcing!
I have been a premium buyer with Made-in-China.com for many years. Since the first time posting sourcing request on Easy Sourcing, I have found several reliable suppliers, it's convenient for me to receive rapid quotations and compare the suppliers. Easy Sourcing has provided tremendous value to me. Now it's my favorite way to find Chinese suppliers.

	the Issuer issued and sold 10,500,000 Shares to Cyberfuture for a total purchase price of $420,000. Pursuant to the ETI Subscription
	Agreement, Cyberfuture purchased 15,330,000 Shares held by ETI Partners IV LLC (“ETI P IV”) for a total purchase price
	of $280,000.

	CITIC PE and/or its affiliates or designees, on the other hand, may form a joint venture (the “JV”) to manufacture,
	distribute or sell CE HRS products in the People’s Republic of China. From October 31, 2016 until the earlier of formation
	of the JV or December 31, 2016, and if the JV is formed on or before December 31, 2016, the JV is continuing to distribute CE
	HRS products, and Cyberfuture holds, directly or indirectly, not less than half of the number of the Shares reported herein, Cyberfuture
	is entitled to appoint an observer to the board of directors of the Issuer. Thereafter upon the establishment of the JV, as long
	as the JV is continuing to distribute CE HRS products, and Cyberfuture holds, directly or indirectly, not less than half of the
	number of the Shares reported herein, Cyberfuture is entitled to nominate a person to be elected to and to serve on the board
	of directors of the Issuer. The foregoing right to appoint a director, if exercised, shall be in lieu of the foregoing observer
	right. The Subscription Agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit 3 to this Schedule 13D, is incorporated herein by reference

	7.8

	Additional Private Placement Representations

	. You are acquiring the Interest or the Stock to be purchased by you pursuant
	to this Agreement for your own account, for one or more insurance company general accounts or for one or more separate accounts
	maintained by you or for the account of one or more pension or trust funds of which you are a trustee or as to which you are the
	sole qualified professional asset manager within the meaning of Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-14 (a “

	QPAM

	”),
	in each case for investment purposes only, and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of all or any
	part of such Interest. You have a pre-existing relationship with the Managing Member and/or its affiliates or agents, and have
	become aware of the formation of the Company and the opportunity to subscribe for Interests therein directly from the Managing
	Member and/or such affiliates or agents, and not by means of any general solicitation or general advertising. You are an “accredited
	investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	“

	Securities Act

	”) or you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of Regulation S promulgated under the Securities
	Act. In addition, you meet any additional or different suitability standards imposed by the jurisdiction in which you reside or
	are domiciled.




	 




	7.9

	Illiquidity of Investment

	. You understand that you must bear the economic risk of an investment in an Interest or the Stock
	for an indefinite period of time because, among other reasons, the offering and sale of the Interests or Stock have not been registered
	under the Securities Act, applicable state securities laws or the securities or similar laws of any other jurisdiction whatsoever,
	and, therefore, the Interests cannot be sold, resold, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of unless they are subsequently
	registered under the securities and similar laws of each applicable jurisdiction, or unless exemptions from such registration
	requirements are available. You hereby agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, assign, transfer, offer, sell, pledge,
	hypothecate or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Interest or Stock (or solicit any offers to buy, purchase or otherwise
	acquire or take a pledge of all or any part of the Interest) except in accordance with: (a) the registration provisions of the
	securities and similar laws of each applicable jurisdiction or an exemption from such registration provisions, and (b) in the
	case of any Interest, the terms of the LLC Agreement. You also understand that neither the Company nor CETY is under any obligation
	to register the offer or sale of any Interests or Stock on your behalf in any jurisdiction whatsoever or to assist you in complying
	with any exemption from registration under the securities or similar laws of any jurisdiction whatsoever.




	 




	7.10

	Beneficial
	Ownership, etc

	. If you are not a natural person, then you: (a) were not organized, reorganized, capitalized or
	recapitalized for the specific purpose of acquiring an Interest or Stock; (b) are not a participant-directed defined
	contribution plan, or a partnership or other investment vehicle in which its partners or participants have or will have any
	discretion as to their level of investment in you or in investments made by you in Interests or Stock; and (c) will not make
	a Capital Contribution that exceeds 40% of your committed capital or total assets.

	to provide separately in writing to the Managing Member the names of each of the partners
	or participants holding interests in you, and the percentage interest which each such
	person holds in you. Each such partner or participant may be required to fill out a separate
	Subscription and Purchase Agreement and Investor Questionnaire (including making the
	representations contained in this Section 7).

	addition, if you are not a natural person, then you are not: (1) a registered investment company under the ICA; (2) an entity
	that is required to register as an investment company under the ICA; or (3) an entity that would be required to register as an
	investment company under the ICA but for the availability of an exemption under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(cX7) of the ICA.

	Please

	acquiring an Interest in the Company, the size of your proposed Capital Contribution,
	and the aggregate Capital Contributions made to the Company, your Capital Contribution
	may be limited to less than ten percent ( 10%) of the aggregate Capital Contributions
	made to the Company.








	 





	7.11	

	Flow
	Through Entities

	. If you are, for United States federal income tax purposes, a partnership, a grantor trust or an S corporation
	(a “

	flow through entity

	”), no other person (a “

	beneficial owner

	”) will be treated as a partner
	in the Company pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.7704-1(h)(3) by reason of the fact that: (a) substantially all of the value of
	such beneficial owner's interest in you is attributable to your interest (direct or indirect) in the Company; and (b) a principal
	purpose of the use of the tiered arrangement is to permit you to satisfy the 100-partner limitation set forth in Treas. Reg. Section
	1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii).

	. You and the Company each agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other and their respective directors,
	officers, shareholders, and members, and each other person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section
	15 of the Securities Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, but not limited
