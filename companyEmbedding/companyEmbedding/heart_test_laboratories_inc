HeartSciences |   About Us
























































 Preserving life one beat at a time  

















OUR MISSION:
“To provide accurate, affordable screening tools for the early detection of heart disease through continuous development of innovative electrocardiography.”





The Problem





Heart Disease Is The Leading Cause Of Death Worldwide






US Healthcare Costs in Billions                                                        






Cardiac Testing Today


Asymptomatic Patient Screening

Not done on a routine basis because effective low cost tools are not readily available

Symptomatic Patient

ECG Test – Lack of sensitivity as a screening test but used regularly to determine if a heart attack has taken place $50-$200
ECG based stress test – Improved sensitivity over standard ECG $250+
CT Scan – Used for obtaining a calcium score $200+
CT based Angiogram – An alternative to nuclear stress test $600+
Nuclear Stress Test – Test showing blood flow to the heart tissue $600+
Echocardiogram – Used for detecting structural abnormalities $500+
Invasive Angiogram – Gold standard for detecting CAD $5,000+







Lack of Innovation

ECG invented before electronics, computers, and software (Circa 1903)
Medical community has many established practices and procedures using traditional ECG technology
Technology until recently was not available to properly analyze additional signal data that has been present
Skills necesary to innovate in this area require multiple disciplines that include mathematics, programming, and a deep knowledge of cardiac function
Significant research required to assess the value of using other waveforms and metrics to provide valuable clinical information






Our Solution





MyoVista is a low cost, accurate screening test to assist in the assessment of heart disease
MyoVista is an important new screening tool for leading cause of death and largest spend area in healthcare
Effective screening can help shift focus to earlier lower cost treatments and better patient outcomes
Targeting the Diagnostic gap – a lack of high quality tools for effective low cost heart screening
MyoVista – Simple, non-invasive, electrophysiology based medical device with innovative and intuitive user interface
$10M and 10 years of time investment to date
R&D is complete – MyoVista fully developed and now moving into production with units shipping early 2017





Incorporates Standard ECG

Produces conventional ECG tracing with interpretive software and MyoVista report
Familiar lead placement – no re-training
Ideal screening tool
Physician reimbursement
R&D completed

Targeting the Diagnostic Gap

Assists in reducing unnecessary expensive testing
Proper screening lowers overall Healthcare costs
Beneficial for GP and Cardiologist

MyoVista Questions & Answers




What is the difference between a 12 lead ECG device and the MyoVista?
Like a conventional ECG, MyoVista provides standard 12 lead ECG trace and automatic interpretive analysis but also has an innovative and intuitive new user interface that employs advanced touch screen capabilities along with a large, high definition screen to make tests simple and easy to perform and review.
Is the MyoVista an at rest test?
Yes, the MyoVista is an at rest test just like a standard 12 lead ECG at rest test. The electrode placement protocol is the same as a standard 12 lead ECG.
Who can perform and interpret a MyoVista Test
The MyoVista is designed to be a front line screening test that can be performed and interpreted by a general practitioner.

About Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. (“HTL”)
Using patented proprietary technology, HTL develops medical devices that focus on the early detection of heart disease. MyoVista’s innovative technology facilitates the early identification of ischemic and other heart myocardial dysfunctions, which can enable improved screening for coronary arterial disease and other cardiac abnormalities. MyoVista® uses standard 12-lead resting ECG protocols to provide a traditional ECG incorporating interpretive analysis, as well as further proprietary informatics to assist a physician in identifying the presence of heart disease. MyoVista® is ideally suited for use in both primary care and hospital environments, and has a 15.6-inch high-resolution touchscreen and incorporates many user features and functionality commonly associated with a tablet device, which makes it intuitive and easy to use, thereby reducing training time.
Heart Disease kills 7 million people worldwide each year, more than all cancers combined, and is the largest spend area in healthcare. MyoVista® helps to bridge the “diagnostic gap” in heart disease today, which is the identification of patients prior to an adverse cardiac event, such as a heart attack.
Heart Test Laboratories is a privately held U.S. corporation which to date has been funded by private investors. For more information, visit www.hearttestlabs.com

 April 26, 2017Heart Test Labs Further Strengthens Board of DirectorsApril 25, 2017- Westlake, TX—Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. announces today the recent additions of Mr. John Q. Adams, Sr. and Mr. John D. Owen to further strengthen its Board of Directors. 
“We are delighted to welcome two highly successful and experienced executives as Independent Members of Heart Test Labs’ Board of Directors.  Their appointments come as product launch is imminent, and we position for an IPO or institutional capital in the coming months.”   said Mr. Andrew Simpson, Chairman.  “Their experience and track records of success in healthcare and strategic business management will help guide HTL in scaling around the world and to maximize the opportunity for the MyoVista®, a breakthrough in the early detection of heart disease.”
John Quincy Adams Sr.
Mr. Adams is a serial entrepreneur and has enjoyed a long career in the healthcare industry.  In 1969, he founded Baylor Laboratories, Inc. which he sold to the Norwich Eaton Pharmaceutical division of Morton Norwich, Inc. in 1980.  He then founded Allerderm, Inc. which was purchased by Vibrac, Inc. in 1985.  In 1985, Mr. Adams founded Adams Laboratories, Inc. and sold it in 1992 to Medeva PLC, a listed company in the United Kingdom following which he served on Medeva’s Board of Directors until 1997 and as an Executive Director, holding various offices, until 1995.  He later repurchased certain assets from Medeva to reform Adams Laboratories, Inc. in 1999 where he served as CEO until 2003.  Adams Laboratories changed its name to Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc. where Mr. Adams served as Chairman until October 2005 having led it through a highly successful IPO.  Adams Respiratory developed prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of respiratory disorders and diseases, including Mucinex™, and was subsequently acquired by Reckitt Benckiser Group in late 2007.
Mr. Adams continues to be an active investor in healthcare companies and retains memberships and board positions in several professional and philanthropic organizations, including the American College of Allergy and the Vanderbilt University Voice Center.  In July 2007, he was elected to the Board of Trustees for Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, and in April 2009 he was inducted into the Hall of Excellence of the Ohio Foundation of Independent Colleges.  He is also an Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.  Mr. Adams holds a degree in Biology from Heidelberg College.
John Owen
Mr. Owen was a co-founder of Jet Blue Airways and was its CFO for many years.  During his tenure Jet Blue went from a start-up to a successful NASDAQ listed company with over $2 billion in revenue.  John managed multiple public and private funding rounds as well as its IPO.  Prior to JetBlue, Mr. Owen served as Treasurer for Southwest Airlines from 1984 to 1998.  Subsequently, he served as CFO for Volotea Airlines during its start-up which included raising €65 million in equity financing before its commencement of flight operations in 2012.  He holds a BA in Economics from SMU, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, and an MBA in Finance from the Wharton School where he was a Mayer Fellow.  Mr. Owen is currently a full time private investor with a particular interest in the medical sector. Mr. Owen also chairs the Audit Committee of HTL.
About Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. (“HTL”)
HTL uses patented proprietary technology to develop medical devices that focus on the early detection of heart disease.  Its first product, MyoVista®, represents a major clinical breakthrough in diagnostic electrocardiography.  It significantly improves clinical efficacy, compared to conventional ECGs, in the early identification of ischemic and other cardiac dysfunctions.  
MyoVista® applies advanced digital signal processing to create a high-sensitivity ECG with new proprietary informatics.  It is ideally suited to both primary care and clinical environments in hospitals and outpatient care centers.  MyoVista® uses standard 12-lead resting ECG protocols to characterize cardiac dysfunction with high accuracy, including for asymptomatic patients.   It also displays standard 12-lead ECG information, including traditional interpretive analysis.  MyoVista® promises to bridge the “diagnostic gap” found in heart disease today, namely the identification of “at risk” patients before suffering an adverse cardiac event, such as myocardial infarction.
The device has a 15.6-inch high-resolution touchscreen display and incorporates many features commonly associated with a tablet device requiring minimal user training as well as easy and intuitive use. 
Heart Disease results in 7 million deaths per year worldwide, more than all cancers combined; it represents the largest healthcare expenditure of any disease.  Heart Test Laboratories is a privately held U.S. corporation.  For more information, please visit www.hearttestlabs.com

 December 10, 2015LA BioMed to Begin Clinical Study to Evaluate Heart Test Laboratories’ MyoVista® Heart Screening Device.Clinical study will evaluate HTL’s Next Generation ECG technology designed to enable low cost screening for Heart Disease 
Westlake, TX, December 10, 2015 – Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. (HTL) announces the start of a clinical study of its MyoVista device by Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (LA BioMed). This study will compare the results of the MyoVista test to an established testing method, Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA). Dr. Matthew Budoff is the principal investigator. The study will compare MyoVista results to subclinical measures of atherosclerosis (CAC and CT angiography) in 200 subjects at risk for coronary disease.  Correlations between the MyoVista reading and the presence of calcified plaque, soft plaque, and CTA stenosis will be determined.  The study is expected to last between 6 months to 1 year.
This study has the potential to confirm MyoVista as a reliable and sensitive marker of atherosclerosis. Findings may provide a strong indication for the value of a MyoVista test to confirm Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in clinical practice, and for the clinical application of MyoVista in management of coronary disease and atherosclerosis.
Background
In 2010, nearly 800,000 Americans died of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal disease. Over 120 million Americans are affected by some type of circulatory disease whether heart disease, hypertension, or stroke. However, in the USA, there are few validated commercially available, non-invasive, and accurate techniques to assess cardiac disease. With the exception of blood pressure and Framingham risk markers, all other measurements currently require costly and specialized equipment. However, the MyoVista a new non-invasive device, is now available for clinical study.
Furthermore, and importantly, in addition to identifying which patients might progress to later stages of disease, the earlier detection may also allow the device to be used to assess therapeutic progress.
A novel electrocardiographic recording method, the MyoVista obtains and processes signal information in a way that permits high resolution of the electrical activity associated with the myocardium. The clinical set up of this technique is identical to traditional 12-lead ECG, however, the recording is focused on the early detection of myocardial abnormalities by non-linear analysis of electrophysiological phenomenon propagated by changes of cellular metabolism level in the cardiac muscle, and the direction, timing and velocity of ion flow. This novel assessment may be capable of detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction in a variety of heart diseases, and may be especially of value in patients at risk for coronary artery disease.

 December 3, 2015Mount Sinai Initiates Clinical Study to Evaluate Heart Test Laboratories’ MyoVista® Heart Screening DeviceClinical study will evaluate HTL’s innovative technology that enables low cost screening for Heart Disease 
Westlake, TX, December 3, 2015 – Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. (HTL) announces that a clinical study initiated by Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York examining the MyoVista heart screening device has commenced.  The clinical study is designed to further evaluate the MyoVista, which incorporates HTL’s patented technology for the early detection of heart disease.  The study will assess the MyoVista indications for the identification of coronary arterial disease (CAD) as compared to computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA) and myocardial dysfunction in patients without CAD as compared to echocardiography.
The lead investigator is Dr. Partho Sengupta, the Director of Cardiac Ultrasound Research and Core Lab, and an Associate Professor of Medicine in Cardiology at Mount Sinai’s Zena and Michael A. Wiener Cardiovascular Institute and the Marie-Josée and Henry R. Kravis Center for Cardiovascular Health. The clinical study is expected to enroll 200 patients and take between 12-24 months to complete.  Mount Sinai is ranked as a top 10 hospital for cardiology by U.S. News’ 2015 annual survey.
Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., being responsible for 1 in every 4 deaths (approx. 600,000 per year U.S.). It is the leading cause of deaths worldwide, more than all cancers combined and is the largest spend area in healthcare.  Heart disease is known as the silent killer, because most affected people do not know they have it (i.e. they are asymptomatic), more than half of patients find out through an adverse event (angina, heart attack or even death).
The “diagnostic gap” in heart disease today is non-invasive, low cost screening to identify asymptomatic patients before an adverse event occurs.  Existing ECG technology is generally not considered effective for use on asymptomatic patients. The U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce and other healthcare bodies around the world recommend against screening with resting or exercise electrocardiography (ECG) for the prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in asymptomatic adults at low risk for CHD events.
HTL believes the MyoVista will provide the opportunity for effective, low cost testing for heart disease in primary care. This would enable physicians to have a valuable additional tool to assist in the process of determining referrals to a cardiologist.
“We are excited that Mount Sinai has decided to initiate an important clinical study of the MyoVista. Mount Sinai is one of the most respected medical institutions in the world and has a strong reputation for research along with being recognized as a center of excellence in cardiology.  Our goal is to save lives and save healthcare dollars by both finding people with heart disease much earlier, and reducing expensive cardiac testing on people that do not require treatment.” stated Mark Hilz, Heart Test Laboratories' CEO.
