February 14, 2012 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



TEMPLE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wilsonart International and Illinois Tool Works (ITW) announce that 
      Kristen Manos will become the next President of Wilsonart.
    


      Ms. Manos brings significant experience to her new role. She was 
      previously Executive Vice President and President of Herman Miller North 
      American Office Environments where she ran a $1.5B profit and loss 
      organization which also included the Geiger subsidiary. Previous 
      experience at Herman Miller was in marketing and market development 
      where she established a branding strategy and a vertical selling 
      strategy in education and healthcare. She also led an initiative to 
      reinvigorate the design focus within the company.
    

      "We are thrilled to welcome Kris into our organization," says Jane 
      Warner, ITW Executive Vice President. "She brings significant knowledge, 
      industry relationships and key strategic perspective from her broad 
      range of experience. She will be able to ‘hit the ground running’ and 
      build on Wilsonart’s already strong foundation."
    

      "Kris brings a rich background and deep experience to our company," says 
      Bill DiGaetano, outgoing President of Wilsonart. "In her roles with two 
      major office furniture manufacturers – Herman Miller and Haworth – she 
      has not only been a customer of Wilsonart, but has been a peer in our 
      industry. She understands the importance of manufacturing high quality 
      product, delivering consistently on time and depending on great 
      relationships with channel partners."
    

      Prior to her Herman Miller experience, she was Vice President of Global 
      Marketing at Haworth, Inc., a Holland, MI-based furniture company. She 
      also led their Product Development team, Customer Satisfaction unit and 
      developed the first strategic plan for the company.
    

      Ms. Manos began her career at Navistar in manufacturing where she had 
      assignments as a first line supervisor in the engine plant, a 
      manufacturing engineer and a financial analyst in materials management. 
      She ultimately became Manager of Strategic Business Development and OEM 
      Marketing.
    

      "I am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead Wilsonart," says Ms. 
      Manos. "This company transformed the laminate industry over the past 56 
      years, through reliability and service excellence, quality products and 
      beautiful designs. That's a great legacy and a great foundation for the 
      future."
    

      Ms. Manos graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in 
      Economics and completed a Masters in Public and Private Management at 
      Yale. She is on the board of KeyCorp, Holland Hospital and International 
      Relief and Development. She is married and has two sons. She and her 
      husband will be moving to the Central Texas area.
    

      Ms. Manos replaces DiGaetano, who announced his retirement late last 
      year. DiGaetano has been President of Wilsonart since 2005 and is a 
      33-year veteran of the company.
