State Tax Information













To access tax information for a specific fund, use the Fund Search below. Enter a fund name, fund number, NASDAQ symbol or CUSIP number in this box, and select the fund from the menu. You will then be taken to the Tax Information section of that fund’s product page.



Tax Center




















Percent of Income Attributable to Direct U.S. Government Obligations for 2016
At least 1% of the 2016 income earned by the following funds was attributable to direct U.S. government obligations:
 




Franklin Flexible Alpha Bond Fund
5.49%


Franklin Global Government Bond Fund
41.22%


Franklin Low Duration Total Return Fund
10.41%


Franklin Strategic Income Fund
10.19%


Franklin Strategic Mortgage Portfolio
4.39%


Franklin Total Return Fund
15.18%




Information for those funds with less than 1% of their 2016 income attributable to direct U.S. government obligations will be available by mid-February on the Search by Fund for Tax Information page of the Tax Center.
States generally grant tax-free status to interest income earned from direct obligations of the U.S. government. This tax-free status may also apply to dividend distributions that mutual fund shareholders receive from a mutual fund’s investment in such obligations.
Direct obligations of the U.S. government include U.S. Treasury bonds, notes, bills and certificates, U.S. savings bonds and many obligations issued by agencies of the U.S. government (such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] and many other federal agencies).
The income on repurchase agreements and mortgage-backed securities, including Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae) securities and Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) securities, does not qualify for tax-free treatment.
Depending upon your state’s laws, you may be entitled to declare a percentage of your income dividends as tax-exempt income on your 2016 state personal income tax return. However, the percentage of direct U.S. government obligation interest available for tax-exempt treatment may be limited in states that require a fund to meet certain minimum investment thresholds. Please contact your tax advisor to determine the availability of tax-exempt treatment in your state. Also, corporate shareholders may be subject to different state income tax return requirements and should consult their tax advisors. You can determine the amount of your income derived from direct U.S. government obligations by multiplying the percentage found here by the total ordinary dividends you received during the calendar year, as reported on your Form 1099-DIV, Box 1a.
 
 

Important Legal Information
The information contained in this Tax Center is not intended to be a complete discussion of all federal or state income tax requirements. This information cannot be used by an investor to avoid any income tax penalties that may be imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. Investors should seek advice from a financial and/or tax advisor about the potential tax implications of their investments in Franklin Templeton fund(s) based on their individual circumstances.







The 2016 income dividends you received from your Franklin tax-free income fund(s) are fully exempt from regular federal income tax. Based on income the fund earned from state tax-exempt obligations, a portion of such dividends may also be exempt from your state’s personal income tax. For investors subject to the alternative minimum tax, a portion of fund dividends may be taxable. Distributions of capital gains and ordinary income, if any, are generally taxable.
You can determine the portion of income dividends that are attributable to bonds of a particular state and U.S. territories by multiplying the percentage found here by the amount of tax-exempt income dividends for each fund as reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 10.
Important Message for California Shareholders: Each fund is required to report to the Franchise Tax Board by May 31, 2017, your total 2016 payments of tax-exempt interest dividends (exempt from federal income tax), and the percentage of this total that is attributable to bonds of California and U.S. territories.
Important Message for Indiana and Utah Shareholders: If you are a resident of Indiana or Utah and own shares in Franklin tax-free income funds, a portion of your tax-exempt interest dividends may be subject to state income tax. See State Tax Information for additional information.
The following table lists the percentage of your 2016 income dividends that may qualify for exemption in your state. The percentage of income dividends by jurisdiction for each separate income distribution that Franklin tax-free income funds paid during 2016 is available by calling Shareholder Services at (800) 632-2301.

The state of Utah provides that income earned from non-federal governmental entities outside of Utah (non-Utah municipal bonds) is subject to Utah income tax unless at least one of the following applies:

The income is derived from bonds purchased prior to January 1, 2003; or
The income is derived from Utah obligations; or
The income is derived from federal government obligations, including U.S. territories; or
The income is derived from obligations of another state that does not tax Utah obligations.

The Utah State Tax Commission lists the states and political subdivisions that do not tax Utah obligations on its website at www.incometax.utah.gov/additions/municipal-bond-interest.
Utah taxable percentages for some Franklin tax-free income funds are found below. Percentages for other funds are available by calling Shareholder Services at (800) 632-2301.
For information about how to report this on your Utah individual tax return, please contact your tax or financial advisor.

The Fund’s investment manager, Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Macquarie Investment Management Business Trust, receives “Credit Quality” ratings for the underlying securities held by the Fund from three “nationally recognized statistical rating organizations” (NRSROs): Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings, Inc. The credit quality breakdown is calculated by DMC based on the NRSRO ratings. If two or more NRSROs have assigned a rating to a security the higher rating (lower value) is used. If only one NRSRO rates a security, that rating is used. Securities that are unrated by any of the three NRSROs are included in the “not rated” category when applicable. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. More information about securities ratings is contained in the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information.

Delaware Tax-Free USA Quarterly commentary June 30, 2017
Overview
The Fund’s benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, returned 1.96% for the second quarter of 2017 as yields declined across all maturity segments despite the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) decision in June to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. Although performance was driven primarily by strong technical factors, markets also were influenced by soft economic data that caused the municipal yield curve to flatten. Yields bottomed in early June before rebounding to end the quarter at 1.83% on the 10-year bond and 2.66% on the 30-year issue. Municipal credit spreads widened by a mere 0.01 percentage points.
Second-quarter municipal supply decreased by 18% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Refunding supply, in particular, slowed sharply with monthly year-over-year decreases of 50%, 38%, and 48% in April, May, and June, respectively. Demand, as measured by mutual fund flows, was positive. According to Lipper, municipal mutual funds took in approximately $5.8 billion during the second quarter, with the heaviest inflows accruing to intermediate-term funds. 
On the economic front, survey results continued to appear stronger than the hard data. First quarter gross domestic product (GDP) was reported at only 1.2%, three-month average payroll growth fell from 201,000 to 120,000, and consumer inflation eased for three consecutive months. However, the FOMC viewed the apparent slowing of economic activity as transitory, with minutes of its May meeting suggesting a June rate hike. The US Federal Reserve’s reinvestment of its Treasurys, agency-backed securities (ABS), and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are expected to be tapered over time. 
Illinois general obligation bonds were downgraded by Standard & Poor’s (from BBB to BBB-) and Moody’s Investors Service (from Baa2 to Baa3) due to the state’s two-year budget standoff. The downgrade caused yields to widen, though Illinois bonds still managed a 1.31% gain for the quarter. Elsewhere, an Oversight Board created by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) used Title III (bankruptcy-like provisions) to address years of weak economic performance that caused Puerto Rico to default on the majority of its debt. A federal judge was appointed to resolve conflicts between creditors, pensioners, and the Commonwealth. Puerto Rico bonds returned -7.33% for the second quarter and -7.99% year to date. Importantly, however, both Illinois and Puerto Rico were isolated rather than systemic issues within the municipal market.  
Within the Fund
Contributing to performance was the Fund’s exposure to long-term bonds (22-plus years), which was the strongest-performing maturity segment within the benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, returning 2.75%. Despite the Fund’s modestly lower return of 2.71% in the long bond segment, a 15.62-percentage-point overweight resulted in a positive relative contribution. Additionally, a 16.26% out-of-benchmark position in below-investment-grade bonds contributed to performance by returning 2.88% versus the benchmark return of 1.96%, while the Bloomberg Barclays High-Yield Municipal Bond Index returned 1.99%.
Meanwhile, the Fund’s exposure in the 20-year segment (17-22 years) was a modest detractor, returning 2.14% versus the benchmark’s 20-year segment return of 2.47%. The underperformance could be attributed to a duration that was 0.59 years shorter than the benchmark in the 20-year segment. However, the Fund’s 3.25-percentage-point overweight helped offset a portion of the underperformance. 
Outlook
As we enter the third quarter of 2017, the market consensus is for the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate one more time in 2017 and to begin tapering the Fed’s balance sheet positions in Treasurys and mortgages. Those moves are largely expected to occur at the Fed’s September and December meetings, although the sequence could depend on incoming data over the summer months. While the FOMC has signaled its desire to normalize the federal funds rate sooner rather than later, we believe the recent easing in inflation may cause policy makers to pause rate hikes in September, thus allowing more time to gather economic data points. The trajectory of rate increases is important, since it not only signals the direction of rates but also the slope of the yield curve. A pause may cause the curve to steepen, while continued tightening should result in additional flattening of the curve.
We believe the slowing in inflation and the recent weakness in nonfarm payrolls are signs that the economy continues to muddle along. Annual economic growth of about 2% has been the operative number over the past few years and we do not foresee a significant change. Therefore, we think the FOMC may continue to raise the federal funds rate slowly with long-term yields remaining range-bound. If long rates stay in a range and short rates rise only slowly, we expect the yield curve should continue to flatten and spread product — such as our portfolio overweights to A-rated, BBB-rated and below-investment-grade securities — should continue to provide excess return. 
This document may mention bond ratings published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch, Inc. For securities rated by an NRSRO other than S&P, the rating is converted to the equivalent S&P credit rating. Bonds rated AAA are rated as having the highest quality and are generally considered to have the lowest degree of investment risk. Bonds rated AA are considered to be of high quality, but with a slightly higher degree of risk than bonds rated AAA. Bonds rated A are considered to have many favorable investment qualities, though they are somewhat more susceptible to adverse economic conditions. Bonds rated BBB are believed to be of medium-grade quality and generally riskier over the long term. Bonds rated BB, B, and CCC are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics, with BB indicating the least degree of speculation of the three.

The views expressed represent the Manager’s assessment of the Fund and market environment as of the date indicated, and should not be considered a recommendation to buy, hold, or sell any security, and should not be relied on as research or investment advice. Information is as of the date indicated and subject to change.
Document must be used in its entirety. 







Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus and its summary prospectus, which may be obtained by clicking the prospectus link located in the right-hand sidebar or calling 877 693-3546. Investors should read the prospectus and the summary prospectus carefully before investing.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt.
The Fund may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a bond that is held by a portfolio will be prepaid prior to maturity, at the time when interest rates are lower than what the bond was paying. A portfolio may then have to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.


High yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risk than investment grade bonds.


Substantially all dividend income derived from tax-free funds is exempt from federal income tax. Some income may be subject to state or local taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) that applies to certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.


Duration number will change as market conditions change. Therefore, duration should not be solely relied upon to indicate a municipal bond fund’s potential volatility.

Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect historical risk-adjusted performance as of 06/30/2017. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Morningstar load-waived ratings do not take into account Class A sales charges. Class A shares without a sales charge (load) are not available to all investors.The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.


Total returns may reflect waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the manager and/or distributor for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

Please see the fee table in the Fund's prospectus for more information. Additionally, the Fund's Class A shares are subject to a blended 12b-1 fee of 0.10% on all shares acquired prior to June 1, 1992 and 0.25% on all shares acquired on or after June 1, 1992.

The Fund’s investment manager, Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Macquarie Investment Management Business Trust, receives “Credit Quality” ratings for the underlying securities held by the Fund from three “nationally recognized statistical rating organizations” (NRSROs): Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings, Inc. The credit quality breakdown is calculated by DMC based on the NRSRO ratings. If two or more NRSROs have assigned a rating to a security the higher rating (lower value) is used. If only one NRSRO rates a security, that rating is used. Securities that are unrated by any of the three NRSROs are included in the “not rated” category when applicable. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. More information about securities ratings is contained in the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information.

Investors should read the prospectus and the summary prospectus carefully before investing.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt.
The Fund may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a bond that is held by a portfolio will be prepaid prior to maturity, at the time when interest rates are lower than what the bond was paying. A portfolio may then have to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.


Funds that invest primarily in one state may be more susceptible to the economic, regulatory, and other factors of that state than funds that invest more broadly.


Substantially all dividend income derived from tax-free funds is exempt from federal income tax. Some income may be subject to state or local taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) that applies to certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.


Duration number will change as market conditions change. Therefore, duration should not be solely relied upon to indicate a municipal bond fund’s potential volatility.

Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect historical risk-adjusted performance as of 06/30/2017. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Morningstar load-waived ratings do not take into account Class A sales charges. Class A shares without a sales charge (load) are not available to all investors.The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.©  Morningstar, Inc.
