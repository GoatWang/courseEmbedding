COME VISIT US


The Northwest offers a great entrepreneurial environment for new  ideas. The Seattle area has been the home of many successful companies: Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, Costco, Starbucks to name a few.  The Port of Seattle is the hub from which these great companies export and where maritime and fisheries still thrive. Think about the positive impact Whooshh products are capable of having for all those seafood providers, clean energy and transport, water resource managers, farmers and the environment.  We are helping build something pretty special, a more efficient and sustainable world. With global warming, it is apparent that everything is connected, and the Whooshh technology works with what nature has provided. We look forward to meeting with you and discussing your next project. Change can't happen without you, but you can make your mission our mission.

Companies
Whooshh Innovations LLC
 






Whooshh Innovations was founded in 2007 and set out to develop a new tube transport system upon which many novel industry applications can be enabled and deployed. We are a privately held company, and have funded years of R&D, through private investment, joint ventures, strategic relationships, and industry and government grants and/or loans. We have been fortunate to develop a substantial patent portfolio in the process.   WHOOSHH is a dynamic company located in Bellevue, WA, USA. It was founded on the belief that there need to be more efficient ways to move delicate objects, perishable fruit and proteins, and live fish from one point to another, regardless of the height to be lifted or the weight of the object to be transported. The result is an object transport system that allows you to transform many of your operations, and challenges many of your assumptions.

                        About Us
                    


With WHOOSHH, batching and carrying by hand is no longer required. Information can be derived by scanning the object as it enters the  Whooshh system, and decisions about where to deliver the object can be made before it exits.  Whooshh systems require less floor space, less water, less power, less maintenance, and less capital investment, which all adds up to giving you more for less. Plus, Whooshh systems are just so magical to watch, when you have one, your customers and constituents will know you are a leader in your field.The Northwest offers a great entrepreneurial environment for new ideas. Seattle/Bellevue has been the home of many successful companies: Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, Costco, Starbucks, and now the world champion Seattle Seahawks, to name a few. When we think about the impact we can have on food suppliers, energy and transportation providers, water managers, and the environment, taken together we think we are part of something pretty special.





                        Whooshh Background
                    


In 1863 there was great fanfare around the first 'Tube' in London. Shortly after, Thomas Edison and Nicholas Tesla, two great innovators, battled in the 'War of Currents', between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC), culminating in the first major AC hydroelectric plant at Niagara falls, in New York. 150 years later, in 2013, Elon Musk has made headlines with his electric cars and his ideas of a Hyperloop transport system. What happened in between? Henry Ford popularized the automobile, Interstate hi-ways were built, Boeing commercialized the airplane, and to move information better, the internet and the information superhighway was conceived. Transporting stuff efficiently is really important, as is the clean energy to power the movement of things more efficiently.Well known products for transporting people, processed foods, and information have been critical to our economic growth worldwide. Yet surprisingly, industry has not much advanced the state of the art of moving live and/or highly perishable product over short distances, from point A to point B. Much is still done by hand, and that which is not, is often done in bulk, relegating industries such as food (No. 1) and energy (No. 2), the two largest industries in the world, to antiquated and inefficient processes.Whooshh transport systems cost effectively re-invent the way we move certain objects (particularly when live or fresh) and by doing so, provides a platform for new applications and solutions, that will decrease waste, improve yield and quality, and enable use of our natural resources for their most productive uses, all while decreasing the environmental footprint. Apple changed the world when they asked us to 'Think Different'. We ask you to 'Think Again'. Should you Whooshh? We think so. Should you wait? We think not. We got this Dam thing figured out.

SmarTOUCH - Bin Filler - Fruit Packing System






 
From novel transport tubes, to innovative dry bin fillers, to next generation scanning and sorting, the industry is ready to transform how packing plants are designed and operated. Over the past few years, we have elicited significant feedback from the tree fruit industry (i.e., packing houses, growers and industry associations) that identified large unfilled gaps between industry requirements/desires and available packing house solutions. These gaps,...
 
 
 
 





 
 


PickerTECH - Model MHS - Fruit Harvesting System






 
Our transport tubes provide for the rapid, gentle, linear movement of fruit and other agricultural products in the field. Historically, the specialty crop industry has heavily relied on manual labor to harvest and pack its crops. As such, increased labor costs, immigration issues and limited technology have provided the impetus for development of automated systems that can dramatically improve worker productivity and efficiency.

Whooshh - Fish Passage System






 
Fish species are affected by the development and operation of dams. Dams without adequate fish passage systems block migrating up stream adults from reaching critical habitat. For downstream juveniles, a substantial proportion can be killed while migrating through dams, both directly through collisions with structures and abrupt pressure changes during...

                        Benefit:
                    





Overall Productivity and ROIThe Whooshh transport system is designed to improve product transport before it is packaged. Less wasted space, less wasted time, less wasted energy, and better quality and high value product yield. Replace expensive “hand carry” systems that utilize boxes/totes (and associated cleaning costs), pallets, ice, forklifts,and labor By reducing these wastes we increase your operational efficiency. Measurable metrics all improve, such as: energy consumption, labor use, product yield per square meter and per employee.Simpler, gentler, and more hygienic product transport is now possible with Whooshh transport systems. We anticipate that our customers will realize a positive ROI in two years time or less – and in many cases much less. With Whoosh transport, set a new higher standard for quality, yield, and productivity. You can't afford not to adopt, regardless of your previous capital investments.HygienicWhooshh Systems are made with durable FDA approved materials capable of withstanding all standard cleaning agents including sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, bleach, chorine, UV, Ozone, and boiling water. CIP adaptation possible. Standard cleaning time for entire system is approximately 30 minutes. Easily cleaned pump-houses contain the only movable parts – no removing conveyor belts or other large components. An added advantage over all other transport systems is the ability to completely dry the transport sleeve thereby reducing the chance of bacterial growth.In comparison, conveyor belts systems are large and cumbersome and hard to clean. In many cases, it is not possible to thoroughly clean a conveyor because of the very large total surface area of the structure and many hidden surfaces. The result of the conveyor design is that plant and vessel operators must use considerable time and resources (labor and material) cleaning the systems – up to 1/3 of the processing plant time is used for cleaning every day.Hi-speedEach system is capable of handling the capacity of today's processing machinery the product is being transported to – e.g. slaughter machine of 20 salmon per minute; heading machine 40 salmon per minute; filleting machine 30 salmon per minute. Optimize the processing line by incorporating our transport systems to avoid buffers such as holding tanks. Up to 45 salmon per minute in each transport tube. Systems that transport larger numbers of smaller fish per minute are also available.Gentle & DryIn contrast to either conveyor belts or aqua pumps, the Whooshh transport system relies upon the creation of a seal around the fish and the introduction of a pressure differential which provides the motive force to the fish (movement). In particular, the Whooshh system provides for a soft, flexible sleeve that accommodates and gently and continuously engages the surface of the fish. The Whooshh system does not move a column of water, it is for practical purposes a dry system. Because the Whooshh system relies almost entirely upon air (only a mist is introduced for lubricity) to create the pressure differential, the mode of force (movement) requires much less pressure and energy than traditional aqua pump systems. The Whooshh system is designed to provide transport of delicate objects (like fresh fruit and live fish) over distance without damage, bruising, or stress. Flexible & VerticalTransport along ceilings is easily accomplished. Take advantage of the “cheap real estate”overhead for the transport of products. Our transport systems are not constrained by traditional height limitations of fixed-in-place conveyor belts in processing plants and can be more easily moved or re-configured . No other transport method can provide the flexibility, ease of installation, and transport efficiency as our Whooshh transport systems. Customizable site specific flexible configurations available. Systems are easily installed and capable of transporting product up and over of other processing machinery.

                        Economics
                    





We will work with you to help you determine the ROI of Whooshh transport within your operations. Each installation is different, but most applications have a return on investment of less than 2 years and sometime as few as 30 days.

Fish species are affected by the development and operation of dams. Dams without adequate fish passage systems block migrating up stream adults from reaching critical habitat. For downstream juveniles, a substantial proportion can be killed while migrating through dams, both directly through collisions with structures and abrupt pressure changes during passage through turbines and spillways, and indirectly,through non-fatal injury and disorientation. Dams also cause increased travel times for juveniles to migrate downstream due to disruption of natural flowing rivers. This increase travel time and/or migration delay,presents an array of potential survival hazards including increased exposure to predation and disease, depleting energy reserves, and potentially causing metabolic problems associated with smoltification.

The effects of dams and other barriers on fish and...
                    


The effects of dams and other barriers on fish and wildlife are unquestionably great. Along the west coast of the U.S., there are currently 27 different Endangered Species Act listed Endangered and/or Threatened species. In the Columbia,Snake and Willamette River basins alone there are 12 Endangered and/or Threatened species of migratory salmon.[2]   Dams, among other factors, have been one of the leading causes of disruption of returning salmon to their native habitat and disruption of migrating juveniles to the ocean leading to severe declines in runs and even extinction of species.  
Currently, upstream adult passage is well-known in the United States and Europe.   These systems include fish ladders, fish lifts, locks, and trap & haul programs that capture and truck fish past barriers for release back in-stream.  The problem is that even though upstream passage systems are well-known, they do not exist on a majority of dams or provide passage around other barriers and they tend to be very costly.  
Additionally, what is not well developed anywhere in the country are upstream solutions that focus on more than the few actual species that passage systems are built to address.  On the West Coast of the United States, the vast majority of upstream passage is focused on returning salmon species.  There are limited passage systems for other species like the pacific lamprey and none for sturgeon, bull trout, Steelhead returning down-stream or any of the other multiple native regional species.   These same issues persist on the East Coast of the U.S. as well with species such as the American Eel, American Shad,native herring, and native Atlantic salmon.
