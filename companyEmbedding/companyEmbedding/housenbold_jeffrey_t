Now, I would like to turn the call over to Shutterfly's CEO, Jeff Housenbold. Jeff?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Christiane, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. I'll provide an overview of our Q3 performance and share some insights about the business and our preparations for Q4 before turning the call over to Brian for a financial review and an update to our full year 2015 outlook.

We delivered strong operational and financial performance during the third quarter as we continued to delight our customers across our portfolio of premium lifestyle brands and execute on the growing opportunity that lies ahead of us in our Enterprise business.
With the holiday season in front of us, we remain singularly focused on fulfilling our mission of making the world a better place by helping people share life's joy, and the memories and sentiments of the holiday season provide us a unique opportunity to strengthen that mission with our outstanding lineup of products, services, and user experiences. The team is prepared to handle this holiday season's expected record order volumes.
During the third quarter we delivered healthy growth on a number of key financial metrics: customers, orders, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and the ongoing efficient return of capital through share repurchases. Both revenue and gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance, operating expenses were slightly lower than planned, and adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow exceeded expectations. Our results once again demonstrate leverage in our model as profitability metrics improved and we expect margin improvement will accelerate as we enter into our seasonally strong fourth quarter. Accordingly, as Brian will discuss in more detail, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, and EPS guidance for the year.
Revenue was $167.5 million, up 18% versus last year and at the high end of our guidance range, representing our 59th consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue growth. Our Consumer business grew 8% to $138 million and our Enterprise business doubled to $29.5 million versus the third quarter last year.
Our Shutterfly brand continued to demonstrate double-digit organic growth, while our smaller brands continued to lag, in line with our expectations as we discussed last quarter. Our Enterprise segment generated significant growth this quarter, benefiting from the contract we signed with a Fortune 50 company at the end of the second quarter, which has the potential to generate up to $350 million over seven years.
The success we are seeing in our Enterprise business further reinforces our belief that the investments we've been making in the Enterprise platform are already paying off and that additional growth opportunities exist for us to better utilize our fixed assets. We also completed the last piece of our facilities consolidation and restructuring in the third quarter and celebrated the opening of our third state-of-the-art facility in Tempe, Arizona at the end of August on time and below budget.
As we discussed in previous quarters, we closed two other Arizona locations and our Elmsford, New York production facility. As a reminder, we estimated the restructuring charges for facility consolidation would be $5 million to $6 million for the year, and they came in within that range. All material facility restructuring activity is now completed and we expect profitability and margin to show improvement this Q4 and next year as we lap our manufacturing infrastructure investments.
Our customer and order growth also reached record highs for the third quarter. Customers and orders across all brands grew 24% and 29% respectively. This resulted in a record 3.1 million unique customers generating 5.3 million orders across all of our lifestyle brands. Excluding GrooveBook, which operates with a $2.99 monthly subscription model, and our discontinued Treat brand, customers grew 7% and orders grew 13% while average order value decreased roughly 6% to $29.17.
The third quarter is typically slower than other quarters due to the lack of any gift giving holiday and results reflect higher promotional activity following our normal pricing and promotional pattern in Q3 in order to generate additional buying activity and consumer engagement leading into the all-important fourth quarter. We are pleased with the progress we made in broadening our demographic and customer reach. Driven by our improved mobile capabilities and continued expansion of new product selections, we are seeing a material increase in customer spend by millennials who now comprise approximately 40% of our active customers.

Separately, we formally entered the Hispanic market with the release of Spanish language cards and stationery, including customization options, Spanish characters, and Spanish-speaking customer service along with a new partnership with actress Maria Canals-Barrera to bring awareness to our new offering.
Moving on to Shutterfly 3.0. As a reminder, we announced our plan earlier this year to build the next generation of Shutterfly and create a world-class memory management service connected to the smartest personalized e-commerce solutions, with a planned roll-out in mid-2016. Our goals with Shutterfly 3.0 are to build a next gen commerce platform to innovate faster, launch more products and service categories, further our mobile creation and engagement capabilities, and bring our award-winning creation paths to wherever people's photos are.
There are five main components to Shutterfly 3.0. First, to provide a next-generation photo service. We are bringing ThisLife directly into Shutterfly.com while also consolidating our mobile apps. We believe that by bringing the photo curation capabilities of ThisLife together with the product creation capabilities of Shutterfly, we will enable a richer customer experience and higher conversion rates and revenue. Having one service, one site, one set of apps, and one well-known brand will drive greater usage and monetization.
Second, Shutterfly 3.0 will provide the ability for us to partner more deeply with other photo sharing sites, allowing customers to create great products and one-of-a-kind gifts wherever their pictures are stored. Third, increase our mobile footprint and capabilities. Revenue from mobile sources grew over 40% year-over-year this past quarter, reaching 16% of Shutterfly brand revenue. During the quarter we launched a universal iOS app with new designs and features, including Throwback and auto upload, which further reduces the friction from uploading photos manually, and we expanded the product assortment within our mobile app, all leading to the 40%-plus growth.
Fourth, reduce the number of technology platforms we manage, thus driving quicker time to market for new features while lowering operating cost and complexity. This aspect of Shutterfly 3.0 will take a little longer as we decided to further modernize the core Shutterfly platform by building shared service APIs before migrating Tiny Prints and WPD over to our new platform. This will allow us to add additional features and functionality to TP and WPD, and hopefully, revenue throughout 2016.
And lastly, to expand internationally through a modernized, efficient, multicurrency, multi-language technology platform.
Turning now to the all-important holiday season. As you know, preparing for Q4 is a major endeavor across all areas of our business, including product and services, marketing, manufacturing, technology, finance, human resources, and customer service. And our teams are better prepared than any other time in my 11 years at Shutterfly.
We have innovative new products to delight our customers including solutions, themed innovations such as the recently launched Make My Photo Book service, and our curated art library where customers can add professional stock photography to their photo books or make other unique gifts with these photos and designs. In photo gifts and home décor, we added a snowflake metal ornament, art prints that showcase the quality of our paper, new personalized bed and bath solutions, etched glassware with wine glasses and Mason jars, as well as new Disney themed home décor products for kids of all ages. Q4 is all about gifting and we have an enormous selection to make it easy to find the perfect gift this year.
At Tiny Prints, our premium stationary brand, we are encouraging our customers to Send Something Spectacular this holiday season. We are showcasing great breadth in innovation in our card assortment, which we believe will meaningfully stand out against our competitors.

First, glitter cards that keep the glitter on the cards, not your floor. Second, envelopes with cutting-edge new designs and options for a full recipient experience. And solutions via multiple design choices such as new fold leaf backup card layouts with a printed return address on the back and envelope liners that add a final personal touch to every holiday card.
Third, we have new ornament cards, more foiled stamped designs, and new design styles with a plethora of multi-photo offerings. Finally, I'm very excited about the Tiny Prints partnership with The Gap, where we will be highlighted in Gap stores this holiday season. More than ever before, we are set to make Tiny Prints a one-stop shop for all of our customers' holiday card needs.
Speaking of the Gap partnership, we continue to expand our brand impressions and reach in advance of the holidays through our integrated marketing campaign and our strategic partnerships with leading brands such as Carter's, Best Buy, Gymboree, Carnival Cruise Lines, and zulily, to name a few.
We continue to refine and enhance our email marketing efforts to improve personalization and relevance. And we continue to leverage PR to align our brands with key influencers who have included Olivia Palermo, Julie Bowen, Chrissy Teigen, Molly Sims and Rachel Zoe, and A-list celebrities like Jessica Alba.
I'm also thrilled that we recently kicked off our fourth season of philanthropic partnership with The Ellen DeGeneres Show, as we continue to help change lives while driving tremendous awareness and media value for Shutterfly.
Finally, we will continue to test and scale TV and radio ads for Shutterfly and we will soon be dropping our largest annual holiday catalog campaign ever for the Shutterfly and Tiny Prints brands featuring all of our exciting new products and designs.
Q4 readiness on the product side wouldn't be anything without the loyal support of our manufacturing and our customer service teams. We are gearing up to increase our manufacturing staff while executing against numerous scale efficiency programs. We recently upgraded to a new virtual language software program to handle call volumes more efficiently and effectively while hopefully creating even higher customer satisfaction during our upcoming holiday peak. I couldn't be more pleased with the progress our team has made in Q3 and the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter.
Now I'll turn it over to Brian for a more detailed review of our financials and outlook. Brian?
Brian M. Regan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with some observations about our third quarter performance, key metrics, and operating results. I'll then conclude with an update to our Q4 and full year 2015 financial guidance before opening the call up for your questions.
Earlier today we posted third quarter results that met or exceeded our expectations in nearly every financial metric. Total revenue of $167.5 million was up 18% year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range led by continued solid growth at our Shutterfly flagship brand and very strong performance in our Enterprise business led by the new multiyear client contract that Jeff discussed earlier. Q3 Consumer revenue was up 8% to $138 million and Enterprise revenue was up 100% to $29.5 million, accounting for 18% of our total revenues this quarter.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, excluding GrooveBook and Treat, average order value, or AOV, for the quarter was down 6% to $29.17. AOV continues to reflect the ongoing strength and over delivery of our photo gift products and mobile channel, as well as end of quarter pricing and promotional strategies plan to generate greater consumer engagement leading into our Q4 seasonal peak.

GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 35.5%, at the high end of our guidance range of 34.5% to 35.5% despite the fact that Enterprise revenue, which carries lower gross margins, grew significantly faster than Consumer revenue in the quarter, and that Consumer margin was impacted by a number of significant events in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, such as lapping the opening of our Shakopee, Minnesota, facility and completing the nonrecurring Arizona consolidation costs and the shutdown costs of our Elmsford, New York facility.
The Enterprise gross margin itself improved from scale benefits and the new client contracts, while the Consumer margin was lower due to the nonrecurring facility charges I just mentioned and greater product mix of photo gift and home décor products, which historically have been largely fulfilled through outsourced partners at a lower margin. We continue to expect more normalized year-over-year gross margin comparisons to begin this Q4.
Operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation totaled $93.8 million, up 6% year-over-year. Breaking OpEx down further, technology and development costs totaled $38.1 million for the quarter, up 14% over prior-year or 23% of net revenues, down slightly from 24% compared to Q3 of last year. Excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization, our technology and development spending totaled $27.1 million, up 9% from the prior year.
Our technology costs were lower as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to lower head count and savings from the co-location data center move to Las Vegas completed in Q1 of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $43.1 million for the quarter or 26% of net revenues, down from 30% in Q3 of last year. Excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, sales and marketing expense increased 4% to $33 million.
Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue were lower due to some timing shifts of costs into early Q4, offset slightly by the rising cost of media and advertising for many of our consumer marketing channels.
General and administrative expense for the quarter totaled $27.4 million, or 16% of net revenues, down from 18% in Q3 of last year. Excluding stock-based comp, credit card processing fees, depreciation and amortization, G&A expenses totaled $14 million, up 6% from the prior year.
Now that most of our nonrecurring restructuring and proxy events are mostly behind us, year-to-date we have incurred roughly $10 million in nonrecurring charges, which is favorable to our previous expectations by a few million dollars due to more efficient shutdown costs and consolidation of our various facility-related initiatives. I'll provide a full-year outlook in a few moments.
Operating loss for the quarter was $49.1 million, well ahead of guidance for a loss of $53.5 million to $57.3 million, or more than 11% better than the midpoint of our expectations. And the pre-tax loss was $54.2 million after factoring in noncash interest expense on our convertible notes.
Turning to our profitability metrics. The adjusted EBITDA loss for Q3 was only $4.4 million, a 55% improvement over the prior year and $6 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. Our tax rate for the quarter was significantly impacted by the better than expected operating loss, and therefore, we reversed and trued up a tax benefit we had taken in the first half based on lower pre-tax expectations.
This over-performance resulted in us accruing a tax provision instead of a benefit this quarter, resulting in an effective tax rate for the third quarter of negative 16.3% compared to guidance of a tax benefit of 14% to 18%. This true-up negatively impacted our in-quarter EPS by nearly $0.50 per share for Q3, but it will normalize for the full year and our guidance today incorporates the full-year impact.

GAAP net loss for the quarter was $63.1 million, or $1.73 per share. Without the $0.48 impact of the tax reversal, GAAP net loss would have been $1.25 per share, or nearly $0.15 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance. Normalizing for the impact of our convertible note offering on our earnings per share, non-GAAP net loss was $58.7 million, or $1.61 per share on a weighted average share count of 36.4 million shares.
The share count came in slightly lower than our guidance of 36.5 million shares as we continued to execute on our previously authorized $300 million stock repurchase plan. Shutterfly repurchased 1.9 million shares in Q3 at an average price of $43.41 for a total of $83.1 million. The accelerated stock repurchase transaction we previously disclosed in Q2 is included in that total. That brings our total repurchases over the past 21 months to nearly $260 million or 5.8 million shares at an average price of $44.77. We have approximately $140 million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining.
Capital expenditures during the quarter totaled $21.5 million including $7.3 million for technology equipment and software, $6.4 million in capitalized software development costs, $7.1 million for manufacturing and building improvements, and $700,000 for rental equipment. For the year-to-date period through September 30, capital expenditures totaled $62.1 million, down nearly 17% compared to $74.4 million for the comparable period last year.
Cash and total investments as of September 30 totaled $142.8 million. Due to the improvements in both adjusted EBITDA and CapEx, year-to-date free cash flow totaled a negative $51.7 million at the end of the third quarter, an improvement of approximately 28%, compared to a negative $72.3 million for the comparable period last year, and this favorable free cash flow trend is expected to continue into our most important fourth quarter period, which leads me to conclude my remarks with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
For the fourth quarter we expect net revenues to range from $528.7 million to $548.7 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of up to 13.5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to range from 59.2% to 59.9% of net revenues, which at the midpoint will be up 165 basis points year-over-year as we begin to fully normalize our comparisons, lap our most significant capacity investments from last year, and start to realize the operating leverage and returns we have been discussing over the past few years.
We also expect operating income to range from $128.8 million to $139.5 million. We estimate our adjusted EBITDA for Q4 will range from $176.7 million to $186.1 million and that our GAAP effective tax rate will range between 1% and 4%. We expect GAAP net income per share to range from $3.46 per share to $3.64 per share based on approximately 35.4 million shares outstanding.
Based on our year-to-date results and outlook, we are increasing our guidance for the year for adjusted EBITDA, operating income, GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and free cash flow per share while lowering the guidance for weighted shares outstanding and capital expenditures. We are reiterating our guidance for revenue of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion, and our gross margin range of 50.5% to 51% of net revenues.
We are raising adjusted EBITDA to 18% to 18.5% of net revenues compared to 18.1% in 2014. Operating income guidance is increasing to $5.1 million to $15.8 million. Excluding the impact of the nonrecurring restructuring and proxy costs of $10 million to $11 million, our operating income would range from $15.1 million to $26.8 million, or up nearly 2.4 times over 2014 operating income of $6.2 million at the guidance midpoint. And adjusted EBITDA margin would be 19% to 19.6% of net revenues or $202 million at our guidance midpoint, up 21% or more than $35 million over 2014 adjusted EBITDA dollars.

We now expect the effective tax rate for 2015 to increase to 20% to 35%. We expect GAAP EPS to range from a loss of $0.26 to a loss of $0.09, or on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted for the impact of the convertible note, from a negative $0.01 to a positive $0.22. Excluding the impact of the nonrecurring charges of $10 million to $11 million, plus depreciation on a nonrecurring basis of $1.3 million, our GAAP EPS guidance would range from positive $0.04 to $0.24 per share.
We now expect a lower weighted average share count of approximately 36.8 million shares. And finally, we expect 2015 capital expenditures will finish lower from 8% to 8.4% of net revenues, down from the third quarter guidance for 2015 of 8.4% to 9% of net revenues.
This results in a revised outlook of full-year free cash flow to range from $103.9 million to $107.5 million, up approximately 38% year-over-year at the midpoint. And our outlook for free cash flow per share is now even higher, from $2.82 to $2.92 per share, or up 44% year-over-year at the midpoint and improved by $0.20 per share over our previous guidance of $2.67 per share.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff for some closing comments before opening the call up for questions. Jeff?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Brian. We're entering the last two months in a very good position. We have great products, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities strategically located for optimal coverage of the United States, and we are staffed and ready for Q4.
This year we expect to reach two key milestones: more than $1 billion in annual revenues, and more than $100 million in free cash flow. Our free cash flow alone is more than the annual revenue generated by most of our competitors. Our margins are showing improvement and we are executing on our vision for the future: to be the leader in digital memory management and commerce. We have tremendous opportunities ahead and the team is energized.
Before we take your questions, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the news of our CFO transition in the 8-K that we filed earlier today. As you may have seen by now, our CFO, Brian Regan, is starting a new chapter in his career and moving on from Shutterfly into private equity. On behalf of the Board and the management team, I want to thank Brian for his partnership and contributions over the past three-plus years, and we wish him the very best in his new endeavor.
I'm thrilled to welcome Mike Pope to the team, who is listening to the call and will be officially joining Shutterfly this week. Mike brings deep financial and operational experience as CFO, COO, and CEO in private and public companies, including several with manufacturing divisions. Brian will be working with Mike on a smooth transition during the next few weeks. Under the CFO, we have built a strong finance leadership team and look forward to Mike further scaling our capabilities.
Lastly, I'd like to give you a quick update on the progress we've made regarding a new proposal for the employee compensation and incentive plan. The Compensation Committee unanimously recommended, and the Board of Directors unanimously approved, an approach to seek shareholder approval for additional shares in our employee stock plan. We look forward to discussing the new proposal with both the buy side and sell side in early 2016.
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Paul Bieber of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Paul Judd Bieber - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, the consumer business, I think it was single-digit growth for the first time in a while. I was hoping you'd give some color around just what's driving that single-digit growth. And then as we head into the fourth quarter, how should we think about the mix of enterprise revenue versus consumer revenue? And then separately, the enterprise gross margins are very strong. How should we think about enterprise gross margins generally going forward?

Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Great. Thanks, Paul. It's Jeff. So, consumer revenue for the Shutterfly brand grew double digits organically during the quarter and we were pleased with the strength in our biggest brand. As our awareness continues to grow, the product assortment continues to expand, and our cohort curves remain very stable. The weakness in consumer continue to be on the smaller brands, which was driven by several factors: a reduction in investment on those brands, particularly in feature functionality and tech and dev; a shifting of marketing resources on those brands; and increased competition from smaller players who are non-profitably buying market share during a seasonally slow third quarter.
As we head into the fourth quarter, given the strength in our core brand and the fact that Tiny Prints is largely a cards and stationery brand who does more than Shutterfly does in its annual revenue in the fourth quarter, we are optimistic about reacceleration of growth in the consumer going into the fourth quarter.
As it relates to enterprise, great results coming out of the enterprise team. Sales were up 100% year-over-year. And this new contract that we signed with a Fortune 50 company has a number of components to it, but overall lifted the profitability for that segment during the quarter and we believe will continue to allow for increased margin in our enterprise business over the coming years. And as we continue investment in that enterprise platform and we complete that, that will allow us to go out to other verticals and hopefully continue to acquire large clients.
Paul Judd Bieber - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you and best of luck, Brian, on your new endeavor.
Brian M. Regan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali of Cantor. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Yeah, thanks. This is actually Naved Khan for Youssef. Congratulations, guys, on the quarter, and Brian, good luck on the move. Just a couple of questions. On the consumer side, I think you guys talked about some weakness in the smaller brands and I just wanted to dig into that a little bit more. So, how much of that slowdown in the smaller brand is because of the fact that you sort of reduced the investments and (32:34) competition? And then, I had a follow-up.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So, hard to parse the investments versus the competition. But, as I said in my prepared remarks around Shutterfly 3.0, our goal is to get to one unified modern global efficient tech platform. And what we started out doing in 2015 was migrating the Tiny Prints and Wedding Paper Divas technology stack onto the Shutterfly stack. As my new CTO and my architecture team and my engineering team dug into that approach, they came back and put forth a recommendation that we modernize the Shutterfly stack first and then build a shared service model where we'd then migrate the platform, the Tiny Prints and Wedding Paper Divas platform in the future.
So that's going to allow us to reinvest in feature functionality going into 2016, which should drive improvement in the revenue growth rate on those smaller brands. And then we'll come back in 2017 and be able to get some efficiencies from this new API shared service model. So hard for us to parse competition versus our own investment, but certainly the reduction in our investment had a – impact on the growth of the smaller brands.
Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. And then I think, Jeff, you mentioned that some of the marketing – maybe it was Brian – some of the marketing spend was pushed out from Q3 into Q4. But at the same time, if I look at the customer growth, it came in really strong. So I wonder if you saw some opportunities to acquire customers toward the end of the quarter and you decided to take that and therefore the marketing spend – or how would you – can you just provide some more color on that?

Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, so it's not uncommon for us to see some of the planned marketing spend in Q3 move to Q4. That happened almost every year I've been here. But with the strength of our partnerships, because of our brand position and our market share, we did a lot more through our partnerships and some free trial and some of the flash coupon sites like Groupon, and that allow us to acquire more customers, so we didn't need to spend hard marketing dollars in the quarter. So we're keeping those in reserve as we enter into the seasonally strong fourth quarter and we'll be able to put more dollars to work against our integrated marketing campaign.
So that's why you saw a reduction of about 6% in AOV if you normalize for Groove Book. That was because we were giving away some free product towards the end of the quarter to get customers back into the fold, for them to upload more photos, for them to receive their product in Q4, and be top of mind awareness as we enter into the busy season.
Brian M. Regan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And that is exactly why we do some of those end-of-quarter promotions. We are generating some customer activity that may not yet fully translate into revenue, which we fully expect to re-engage for the fourth quarter and that is assumed in the guidance we've given today for the fourth quarter revenues.
Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Got it. Okay. And then one final question, if I may. I know I said the last one was going to be the last question, but I promise this one would be. So, on the enterprise side, we know that fourth quarter tends to be pretty tight in terms of capacity and I guess, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you probably are 100% to capacity. So, as we think about how enterprise can do in this quarter, we just saw 100% kind of growth in the third quarter. How should we model it out if we had to think about it?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, so couple of things. One, a large part of the reason why we opened a new 300,000 square foot facility in Shakopee, Minnesota, last year and a 300,000 square foot facility in Tempe, Arizona, this year was to be able to accommodate the growth of enterprise during all quarters, including the fourth quarter. Enterprise also works on slightly different – not entirely – but slightly different machinery. And so, with our temporary hiring, we're able to both staff the labor as well as our capacity to be able to serve the needs of our enterprise clients simultaneously and delivering on our consumer business.
So we feel good about the capacity. And with the current footprint of our three state-of-the-art modern plants in South Carolina, Minnesota, and Arizona, we believe we have capacity to do towards $350 million in annual revenue for enterprise with the current facility infrastructure. As we think about the fourth quarter, given that 52% or roughly thereof revenue for consumer occurs in that quarter, you would expect consumer to have a greater weighting of the total revenue in the fourth quarter than it does in the third quarter.
Brian M. Regan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And then also, there is going to be some outsourcing of enterprise that would occur more often than not in that fourth quarter when we've got the consumer business being more done in-house. So, the favorable margin trends that you saw in the third quarter for enterprise won't continue to that same extent in the fourth quarter, and that's incorporated into our guidance.
Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Good afternoon. And first off, Brian, sorry to see you go, but best of luck to you and welcome to Mike. Couple of questions on the business. First, one of the larger European players was acquired recently at, I think, a double-digit EBITDA multiple. And I wonder if you had a chance to look at the books, why that wasn't a fit. And might that deal change your strategy or timing for expansion into new markets? And I have a follow-up.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, we are aware of that deal. It looks like it traded at 10x current EV to EBITDA. Keep in mind that they don't take on storage because of the privacy laws in Europe. So, part of our value proposition has been free unlimited storage for our customers and that has been part of why we have more than 65% of the market share. And so, slightly different market in which you're playing, so it has a lower capital intensity than the U.S.-based business. And so when you normalize for those things, it's about a 10x current, we're trading at about 7.5x. So the difference represents a control premium, plus a lower capital intensity.
As we talked about Shutterfly 3.0 vision on the call, one of the five key components is to build a modern global technology platform that will allow us to take Shutterfly and our family of brands beyond just North America. And so as we roll out and continue to invest over the next 18 months to 24 months on the Shutterfly 3.0 vision, that will allow us the ability to compete on a global basis.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, down that – Jeff, a broader question in terms of the source of new consumer segment customers and the mix of millennials that you referenced on the call. Are the majority of your new customers now in the younger cohorts that have essentially skipped the offline channels altogether? And what are the spending and engagement patterns that you're seeing from newer users compared to the older cohorts? Thanks.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. We're excited about the new subsegments in which we're able to attract into the family of brands. Millennials, as I indicated, was about 40% of active customers on Shutterfly. Mobile was up 40% year-over-year. And we've made a concerted launch into the Hispanic and Latino market, which represents a very fast-growing demographic in America. So we believe those investments, while already paying off, will continue to do so in the future.
As you look at the spending patterns of customers, what we have said is we're seeing a slightly lower AOV on mobile because today, we're not really pushing photo books on a smartphone and we don't offer the ability to make cards and stationery on a smartphone today, those are part of the Shutterfly 3.0 replatforming effort. And as you've seen from both Google and Apple, that tablet sales are down to about 6% year-over-year growth. So, people are either using a very small screen or a very large screen and we're playing in both of those.
Millennials are not just going exclusively online. They are walking into retail and they're doing some purchases in retail. What we want to do is build the Shutterfly 3.0 vision that aggregates their images across any device, any ecosystems, and allows the power of our creation paths to go wherever their photos go. And part of the replatforming will allow us to bring the entire catalog of products and services on Shutterfly.com to Shutterfly Mobile, which should increase the conversion rate, the revenue, and the average order value.
And then by integrating ThisLife where we're using algorithmic machine learning to infer about the images, we take out more of the human interaction and friction and the time-consuming aspects of product creation and we move to a thoughtful impulse purchase that could be done on any screen. We believe that series of investments will increase conversion rates, revenue and lifetime value.

Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Kulkarni of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rohit R. Kulkarni - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you. And best of luck to you, Brian. I would be sorry to see you go. I guess in terms of Wedding Paper Divas and Tiny Prints, probably the second time in second quarter you've called out the in-progress technology platform migration. Can you just draw out what milestones you are tracking as far as integrating the platforms are concerned? And how prepared do you think you are as far as Q4 heavy season is concerned? And I have a quick follow-up.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. As I indicated in my prepared remarks and a previous question, we were going to move the technology platforms at the end of this year into the early part of next year. We decided to a delay that by about 12 months to 18 months so that we can build a modern technology platform and have everything on a modern technology platform using the shared service model, which will allow us to reinvest in feature functionality and product assortment going into 2016, which should have a positive impact on the revenue growth for both Wedding Paper Divas and Tiny Prints.
As it relates to key milestones, we have a number of them on Shutterfly 3.0 that we're not disclosing externally, but it is the largest project that our team is undertaking and we have daily scrums and weekly release meetings so that we're constantly keeping on track to our key internal milestones.
Rohit R. Kulkarni - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And on the international expansion side, any more color commentary you can give, Jeff, in terms of specific investment plans or any build-outs you would need to do or what needs to happen for you to take an international expansion plan, a more concrete step towards that?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. The completion of Shutterfly 3.0, when we do that, the platform will become double-byte-enabled, multicurrency, multi-language. And then the next step is simply some localization because you don't want to go to England with American English. You want to go with the Queen's English, so a little bit of local translation which is relatively quick and inexpensive, and then local marketing.
And so, after we get the platform, there's not a lot more to be done to be able to go international. As we approach that point of view, we'll give the Street more visibility as to what our international plans are. But as I indicated, finishing the platform work on 3.0 is another 12 months to 18 months. That doesn't mean we're not going to get benefits from the ThisLife integration and new releases and mobile updates along the way, but to be at a point where we can go international is more like 18 months.
Rohit R. Kulkarni - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. Jeff, I was hoping you could provide some additional detail on the adoption and engagement for ThisLife. What does the timeline look like for you to begin putting marketing dollars behind it? And has the launch of Google Photos and the evolution of some of the similar services like iPhoto impacted your outlook on the prospects for it?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Heath. So what we're doing with ThisLife is we're merging it into Shutterfly and the ThisLife brand will go away, as I indicated in my prepared remarks. It will just be Shutterfly, the all-new Shutterfly. And so, we haven't been marketing ThisLife knowing that that is coming outside of a link on the website which tens and tens of thousands of people sign up each quarter. And so we're pleased by the engagement. What we've seen is those that sign up for ThisLife, their lifetime value is meaningfully higher than those that aren't using that service. And so I think that bodes well for the future.

And as we integrate it, we're not going to give customers a choice. It's just going to be the new Shutterfly and they're going to get all of that power of facial tagging, of curation, of creation of stories, of pulling in Facebook information, all of that. And so we're very excited about that and that should occur in the first half of 2016.
As it relates to Google Photos and others, I don't think that has an impact on our timeline. Part of one of the five key strategic initiatives around 3.0 is about bringing the power of our product creation, manufacturing, customer support, and e-commerce monetization to wherever your photos are. So, I think that actually allows us to partner in a much deeper way with players in the ecosystem that have large amounts of photos. Obviously, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Google, Apple are players who have a lot of photos that aren't monetizing through direct e-commerce today. And given our scale, our brand, our quality, and our expertise, we think if we continue to build the APIs and the ability to partner in a deeper way, that will be good for Shutterfly as well as our potential partners.
Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Streppa - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Yes, thanks for taking my questions. This is actually John Streppa. Just curious, you mentioned that mobile was up 40% year-over-year and a couple quarters into 3.0. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the information you've gotten from these mobile transactions and consumer behavior? How has it changed your view on customer stickiness, repeat orders, increasing order size, et cetera?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, the mobile customers, so, some portion of our mobile customers are new to Shutterfly Inc. and they're exclusively mobile. Others, and the vast majority, are more customers that are using us in multichannel. So, they may start a project on the couch on their iPad. They may finish it on their desktop at work on Monday morning. Or they may get an email on mobile which then they – reminds them to login at night. Right, so we're seeing multi-touch attribution across many of the devices. And so mobile is incremental to the overall spend that these customers would be doing on Shutterfly.
The one negative today that we're seeing from mobile is a slightly lower average order value, and again, that's because we don't have the full catalog of products that are available on the dot-com or the desktop available on mobile today. The investments we're making in the 3.0 platform will allow us to have equal offerings across both mobile, tablet, and desktop, across both Android, iOS and Kindle. So we're going to be device-agnostic, platform-agnostic; the power and the uniqueness of Shutterfly will be available wherever your photos reside on whatever device and whatever ecosystem our customers choose.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
All right, thank you. Just a couple. First, could you talk a bit about what drove the year-on-year gross margin expansion in the enterprise business? I think obviously it seems like enterprise is going to be an increasing percentage of the mix going forward and I guess that'll be coming in at a lower margin relative to consumer. So, I guess in light of that trend, how should we be thinking about margin expansion in 2016? And is that sort of implicitly included in your general commentary around margins expanding in 2016?

And then just one quick second one. You also talked about Shutterfly 3.0 setting the stage for international expansion. And how should we be thinking about any costs associated with that? I imagine that building a brand internationally can have some incremental costs associated with it. So just was curious how that might affect margins at some point in the future? Thanks.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, we were pleased by the continued progress in Enterprise, and it's not one thing. It's actually multiple things. So it first starts with the mix of the clients you have and the work that the clients need in that particular quarter. Certain projects have lower margin than others. With the signing of this large multi-year, up to $350 million contract with a Fortune 50 customer, part of that work stream involved more complex projects, which carried a slightly higher margin because of our unique capability to deliver it. So margin will move around, but it's moving in the right direction, which is up.
The other thing that I want to make sure people understand is if you take a 5x7 card and you sell that to a consumer, we sell that between $2.19 and $2.39 kind of rack rate. You take that same card and the same ink and the same paper and the same labor and you sell it in Enterprise, you're selling that for $0.19 to $0.30. So the gross margin in Enterprise will be inherently much lower, but you're getting much more volume, and as you get volume, your overall economics of buying paper and ink gets more efficient, not just for the Enterprise business but across your entire base.
You also get benefits in shipping and you get benefits in labor utilization and you get benefits in capacity utilization and throughput on your machines. So Enterprise is not only benefiting the Enterprise division, but it's benefiting the entire corporate P&L. So we think Enterprise margins will continue to move around quarter to quarter, but generally in the direction of going up, but they will never approach the level of consumer margins.
Second, what I've said consistently is that I believe margins in the back half of 2015 will get better and I think we demonstrated that in Q3 and also with our Q4 guidance and full-year guidance, and that 2016 margins will continue to improve. But we're just going to continue to invest in Shutterfly 3.0, in mobile, in wedding, in enterprise, in subsegments like Hispanic so that we are growing the ultimate size of the franchise and that the total free cash flow dollars and the total revenue will be bigger in the out years. And so it's a balanced approach between continue to expand margins but making sure that we have healthy top line growth and continued opportunities for the firm.
As you look out into international, I think it's premature to be able to be specific around costs, but certainly we would only – there's always a startup cost in any specific country, having been at eBay and AltaVista when we went global and being on Groupon's board, lots of experience around the startup costs. There's certainly startup costs, but remember currently in the U.S. we are profitable on the very first transaction for every customer, because we're vertically integrated and because of our brand and our acquisition costs. So while there's likely some startup costs, I don't anticipate them to be large and we will be thoughtful about how we do that, and we will communicate that to the Street in 18 months or so when we're prepared to go international.

Maybe related to the Tiny Prints and discussion around the pushout of that replatforming until next year. Last Q4 there was some production issues around Tiny Prints. I think it was a pretty complex card stock. And maybe could you give us an update what you've done to resolve that and kind of the risk that something like that happens in Q4? And then my other question is, the strong growth in Enterprise in Q3, was that all related to the Fortune 50 customer? Or were some other things in there that was able to push it to the higher level? Thanks.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So Tiny Prints is our premium brand and what's happening in the industry is that those affluent customers are looking for something new every year. So a couple years ago it was rounded corners, then it was clear cards, and then it was foil last year and this year our glitter cards are really popular and resonating. So you've got to keep the line fresh. And so you're constantly investing in new form factors, new finishing, new edge treatments, all these things that add a little bit of extra complexity each year into your execution.
Last year our big challenge was primarily from the fact that our foil cards saw greater demand than we forecasted and our outsource partner for that technology couldn't handle the overflow of demand that we generated, and so that created some delays for customers. We brought some of the production in-house. We've expanded our outsource partner network, and we believe we have a better handle on forecasting. But if you've got something that's really popular and it exceeds your expectations in some ways that's not a bad thing.
And then on the technology side, Tiny Prints was built as a startup. We've scaled it from a database standpoint, from a security standpoint, from a capability standpoint, but it's still a technology stack that needs to be modernized and moved on to the larger scaled Shutterfly platform. And so the tech team has worked since last Q4 to ensure that our uptime and availability is where it is. So we can't foresee unforeseen things today, but I believe that we're very well prepared from a technology and manufacturing standpoint.
As you think about Enterprise, it wasn't just this new contract. We continue to execute on existing projects for existing clients and taking on more work as we continue to deliver and meet and exceed expectations of those Enterprise clients. And we landed a number of new clients that are still relatively small but that we're investing in and that we believe will continue to grow. Over the last few years, we've actually pruned our Enterprise client list significantly, essentially firing over 50 clients, because we didn't believe they would hit the profitability thresholds we would need or the size and scale that we would want.
So as we invest in the platform, the Enterprise platform, that will allow us to go after larger, multi-year, multimillions of dollar clients instead of hundreds of thousands of dollars of deals, and we're in the middle of that transition period over the next four quarters to six quarters, but benefiting from a few very large clients that are covering our fixed costs as we make that transition.
Brian M. Regan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And Kerry, if I could add on this, there's scale benefit to the Enterprise business that we're actually seeing. But keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year that we're now lapping, there was some nice growth from around $14.7 million to around $20 million in revenues. So the year-over-year growth hurdle will get a little bit higher, and so we'll begin to get those scale benefits, but the growth percentages will certainly be a higher level of hurdle on a year-over-year basis. And keep that in mind in the forecast.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Bartlett of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Thank you. Could you just go back over the promotional activity that you're engaged in at the end of the quarter? Specifically, the flash sales and how aggressive was that activity versus prior third quarter periods? And just remind us what flash sales or Groupons or things like that do to average order, customers and total orders? What impact does it have on those numbers?
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So I think we did slightly more at the end of this Q3 than we did the previous year, but not orders of magnitude, slightly more. It's part of our promotional cadence we've been talking about publicly for years now during the third quarter, getting people into the fold to reactivate them for a large card order in the fourth quarter.
Typically when we offer a free product, be that that through a Groupon, through an email coming directly from us to our customers, or through a partnership like McDonald's or Gymboree or Children's Place or the Gap, that customer is getting, for example, let's say, a free photo book. That is a $30 value to them. That costs us mid-single digits to produce. They're paying for shipping. They might add some extra pages. They might add another product into the basket.
So in general, we're about breakeven on a free product offer. And now we have a customer into the fold. Some of those are brand-new customers and some of those are existing customers that go, wow, look at this, I got something free. And the mentality is it's free, so I'll add some other things to the basket. And so that drove down AOV by about 6.1% year-over-year, but also AOV is going down because we offer from time to time free shipping as well. And so people are more thoughtful about hitting the free shipping thresholds than not. So nothing meaningfully different than in the years past, but utilizing some of these large partnerships that we've been able to secure because of our brand strength into the tail end of Q3.
Brian M. Regan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And in a Q3 period where there's no national gift-giving holiday, you do have a little bit of a greater impact on AOV in the third quarter versus the reengagement and the sales that you get out of that same customer in the fourth quarter.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks a lot. I know you touched on this earlier, but just given the big jump in Enterprise revenue Q-over-Q, can you give us some more color on how you expect Enterprise to look in the fourth quarter directionally just so we can better understand the trend? Thanks.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, hard to give more specifics, Kevin, because we don't guide forward on Enterprise. Just the percentage of the total revenue will be down in the fourth quarter because of the strength of consumer in the holiday season. We're very pleased by the trajectory of Enterprise. I think the Street has about $80 million in revenue in Enterprise, which is a five-year-old business that's growing at a very nice double-digit clip. And we think that will continue to expand.
As we finish the Enterprise platform, which will take another 12 months, we believe that we will be able to add additional clients. We only have three or four salespeople in the whole company generating around $80 million in revenue this year, so we feel good about that. What we want to do is build more capabilities so that when we go in either to a competitive bake-off or into a sales pitch, there's clear differentiation in our capabilities, our quality, our timeliness, our account management, and our ROI for our Fortune 1000 customers.

Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trisha Dill of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Trisha Dill - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So just a quick one first on the flash sale promotions at the end of the quarter and the free shipping promos that you just referred to. Were those planned? Or were they in response to anything that you saw throughout the quarter on the demand side? And then I just have one follow-up.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, Trisha, they were largely planned because these partnerships take months or quarters to layout because we have to be in concert with our co-marketing partners' marketing calendars. So for the large part they were planned out. And as we looked at our strategy last year and what was working, getting more customers in at the tail end of Q3 benefited Q4. So we did a little bit more going into this Q3.
Trisha Dill - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then I know every quarter we talk about the trade-off between order and customer growth and AOV, but I'm just wondering if there's been any shift in the way you think about balancing those metrics, now that we've seen four quarters of flat to down AOV on an adjusted basis, which I don't think we've seen before. And I know you've said recently there's no real change in your customer acquisition costs, but just wondering if you could speak to the payback on your ad spend given some of these new customers are seemingly spending less, at least initially. Thanks.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So if you look back before the last four quarters, the previous I think six quarters saw a meaningful increase in AOV, right, and so it's a balance to try to find where to land that dial. AOV has also negatively been impacted, as I said, from mobile. But getting more mobile customers, which was up 40% year-over-year and I think approached 16% or 17% of the quarter's revenue, that's going to continue to be a drag on AOV until we get to Shutterfly 3.0 and we can make a full assortment of cards and stationery, photo books, and all the gifts available on mobile. And so I think we'd anticipate seeing continued modest decline in AOV with continued increase in customers and the number of orders from those customers until 3.0 is complete.
Operator
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer period. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Jeffrey T. Housenbold - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on our Q3 2015 earnings call. As you can see from our prepared remarks and Q&A, the leverage that we've been talking about in the business is starting to materialize, and I believe you'll see continued leverage throughout the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016.
We continue to invest in our leading brand portfolio in terms of technology, marketing, feature functionality, and the robustness of our various technology stacks that I believe will serve us well for years to come. You've also seen Enterprise continue to deliver on the promise in growing in both its market share and in our profit margins.
And then as we've been talking about, we're making efficient return of capital to our shareholders through buybacks and decreasing capital expenditures for the full year, leading to up to 44% increase in our free cash flow per share. So we are pleased by both our operating metrics, our corporate strategy, our capital allocation strategy, and we look forward to talking to our investors in early 2016 about an approach that was unanimously agreed upon by our board and our Comp Committee to get additional shares in our Employee Incentive Plan so that we could continue to attract and retain great talent to execute against the strategy that has been allowing us to be the market leader for the last 15 years.

So with that, we look forward to our one-on-ones and seeing you guys out on the road. Thanks.

Dow industrials just 170 points shy of 22,000 milestone
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged wrapped up at an all-time closing high Friday, ending the week u 1.2% higher, even as the broader market was weighed by a recent slump in shares of technology companies. But notably, the Dow finds itself just 170 points away from hitting another psychological milestone: 22,000. The Dow last hit 21,000 on March 1, but has advanced in fits and starts over the past five months amid growing doubts about how quickly President Donald Trump can implement pro-growth policies pledged during his campaign for the White House. A late-Friday defeat in passing a bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act, underlines those fears. Still, the blue-chip gauge has enjoyed a relatively steady climb, powered by strong moves in shares of Boeing Co. , which has been a key driver of the price-weighted average in recent weeks and months. Boeing shares have climbed 55% so far this year, making it the best performer in the benchmark. The Dow closed on Friday up 0.2% at a record 21,830, the S&P 500 index , meanwhile, ended down 0.1% at 2,472, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 0.1% at 6,374.

Dow ends at record; S&P 500, Nasdaq see weekly fall
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced modestly on Friday to close at an all-time high, with gains this week fueled by earnings from bellwether companies such as Boeing  and Verizon Communication . The Dow  added 33.76 points, or 0.2%, to 21,830.31 and gained 1.2% over the week. But broader markets slipped on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posting modest weekly losses. The S&P 500  closed 3.32 points, or 0.1%, lower at 2,472.10, retreating from record levels set on Wednesday. The benchmark index finished the week roughly where it started. The Nasdaq Composite index  declined 7.51 points, or 0.1%, to 6,374.68 and ended the week 0.2% lower. On Friday, sharp post-earnings losses from Amazon.com  weighed on the main indexes.

Wall Street isn’t ready for a 1,100-point tumble in the Dow industrials
              
              The U.S. stock market is on such a parabolic march higher that Wall Street investors may have forgotten what a typical daily downturn feels like anymore.

Long-dated Treasury yields see weekly climb 
              
              Long-dated Treasury yields rose for the week as recovering commodity values and strong readings in economic data raised growth and inflation expectations.

S&P 500, Nasdaq finish lower after Amazon disappointment; Dow closes at record
              
              The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both finish slightly lower on Friday for weekly losses as Amazon.com shares slump on disappointing earnings, while the Dow industrials finishes at a record for a weekly gain.

Dow industrials just 170 points shy of 22,000 milestone
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged wrapped up at an all-time closing high Friday, ending the week u 1.2% higher, even as the broader market was weighed by a recent slump in shares of technology companies. But notably, the Dow finds itself just 170 points away from hitting another psychological milestone: 22,000. The Dow last hit 21,000 on March 1, but has advanced in fits and starts over the past five months amid growing doubts about how quickly President Donald Trump can implement pro-growth policies pledged during his campaign for the White House. A late-Friday defeat in passing a bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act, underlines those fears. Still, the blue-chip gauge has enjoyed a relatively steady climb, powered by strong moves in shares of Boeing Co. , which has been a key driver of the price-weighted average in recent weeks and months. Boeing shares have climbed 55% so far this year, making it the best performer in the benchmark. The Dow closed on Friday up 0.2% at a record 21,830, the S&P 500 index , meanwhile, ended down 0.1% at 2,472, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 0.1% at 6,374.              
              
            

4:18 p.m.  Today4:18 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dow ends at record; S&P 500, Nasdaq see weekly fall
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced modestly on Friday to close at an all-time high, with gains this week fueled by earnings from bellwether companies such as Boeing  and Verizon Communication . The Dow  added 33.76 points, or 0.2%, to 21,830.31 and gained 1.2% over the week. But broader markets slipped on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posting modest weekly losses. The S&P 500  closed 3.32 points, or 0.1%, lower at 2,472.10, retreating from record levels set on Wednesday. The benchmark index finished the week roughly where it started. The Nasdaq Composite index  declined 7.51 points, or 0.1%, to 6,374.68 and ended the week 0.2% lower. On Friday, sharp post-earnings losses from Amazon.com  weighed on the main indexes.

Groupon, Inc.

                    Launched in November 2008, Groupon features a daily deal on the best stuff to do, see, eat, and buy in 48 countries, and soon beyond (read: Space). We have about 10,000 employees working across our Chicago headquarters, a growing office in Palo Alto, CA, local markets throughout North America and regional offices in Europe, Latin America, Asia and around the world.

Our company philosophy is pretty simple: we treat our customers the way we like to be treated. That boils down to a few key things:

We sell stuff we want to buy. A great price is only half the battle - it's also got to be a great product or service. Between our top-rated business partners and unbeatable prices, you should feel comfortable venturing out and trying something new - just because it's featured on Groupon. We want Groupon to be an addiction you can feel good about.

No BS. We really want you to love Groupon. "Gotchas" and buried conditions that sour the experience are a terrible way to accomplish that goal. We want each Groupon purchase to feel too good to be true, from the moment you buy to the day you use it. If there's anything unusual about a deal (e.g. an inconvenient location) we go out of our way to point it out
