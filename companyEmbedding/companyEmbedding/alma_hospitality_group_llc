Welcome to Alma | Hospitality for ideas















































Welcome to Alma

Alma mater is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university or college. Translated as “nourishing mother”, it suggests that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students and the phrase can be traced back to the motto of the University of Bologna, founded in 1088.


Alma is also the name of a members’ club located in Stockholm. Founded to provide intellectual and social nourishment to our members, we aspire to provide a space to grow, learn new skills, meet new people, grow a company or embark on a new project.






Hospitality for Ideas

Recognizing the growing need for new forms of work space and collaborative environments, Alma opened its doors on Nybrogatan 8 in Stockholm in December 2016. A space for work and play, Alma was founded for the sole purpose of nurturing creative people and their ideas.
The building, which for many years was home to Beckman’s School of Design, has been  reimagined together with a group of architects and designers who have created furniture and products specifically for the house, all brought together by Alma's Creative Director Fredrik Carlström and General Manager Anna Behring Lundh.
Architectural firm Tham & Videgård helped us bring our concept to life and also designed desks, tables and benches commissioned throughout the house. They also designed the signature ceiling lamps w171 alma which are produced by Wästberg and won “Best Lighting” at the 2017 Stockholm Furniture and Lightning Fair.


Nathan Warkentin has developed the visual identity; ceramicist Rikard Palmquist has designed the tableware; Moa Ott created hangers and other wood products,  the large scale, custom-made couch was  developed together with Erik Järkil, hand made ceramics signs and hangers were made by Sara Söderberg, textiles were designed and made by Christina Nordlind Hejdenberg, and a mobile light installation was designed by Kasper Friis Kjeldgaard.
The five-story structure has a mindful balance of work and social spaces, including dedicated work areas, rooms for meetings and collaboration, a state of the art music studio, an outdoor terrace, and communal and private dining spaces. The restaurant, overseen by chefs Martin Brag and Leo Frodell serves meals exclusively for members and their guests.
The first floor hosts a unique coffee bar, and the first European outpost of acclaimed design and concept store Austere, both of which are open to the public.






A House for Creatives

Being a private community, Alma is made up of members working in design, architecture, technology, film, fashion, advertising, branding, music, art and media. We offer five types of membership: Open, Dedicated, Studios, Out-of-Town and Private Office.
Open gives you unlimited access to the restaurant and all communal floors. You also have the ability to book meeting rooms and use other office amenities. Dedicated members enjoy all the benefits of Open with the added convenience of a permanent desk and storage space. Teams of three or more can be housed in dedicated Studios. Out-of-Town memberships are for those not permanently based in Stockholm and include all the benefits of an Open membership.


The Private Offices located in the front part of the building combine the privacy of a traditional office with all of the amenities of the house.
If you would like to become a member, please apply here. Alma is a small and intimate creative community, and the Membership Committee meets monthly to admit new members when space is available.

Driving Direct Bookings
One of the biggest challenges faced by independent hotels is trying to maximize direct bookings. Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Orbitz and others serve an important role in funneling new business to hotels, but they take a hefty commission in return. While we believe this is a key piece of developing a hotel’s customer base, it is critical that those guests do not return to the OTAs for their next booking. And, if we can get a guest book direct for their first booking, that’s even better. Knowing this, Charlestowne has made a concerted effort to drive direct bookings up front, and convert OTA guests into direct booking guests when they return. Our results speak for themselves. Based on our internal data, compared against nationwide data from Smith Travel Research, independent hotels managed by Charlestowne Hotels earn direct bookings at three times the national average, resulting in a mix that is 76% direct, 24%OTA.

Independent Direct BookingsUS Industry Average: 25% vs. Charlestowne Hotels: 76%
Franchised Brand Direct Bookings US Industry Average: 64% vs. Charlestowne Hotels: 77%
