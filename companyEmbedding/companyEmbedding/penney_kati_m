Also add a few colored t-shirts to mix things up a bit. You’ll find men’s t shirts are especially handy in the wintertime as a layering option to place an additional barrier between yourself and the cold.

3. Trench coats are one of the most chic options you can keep your closet. When wearing a shirt and jeans, a trench coat will make the outfit look more pulled together. If you’re in your finest formal attire the timeless double breasted construction of a trench coat will only make you look more debonair. A black suit will be versatile until the end of time. There’s not much you can’t wear with a black suit. The key is finding the proper cut that looks best on you.

4. A leather jacket just exudes cool. It’s really easy to make a case for a leather jacket. Not only is it stylish but it’s extremely practical. It looks good with work and casual clothes. It’s warm, and as long as you treat it right, you’ll be able to wear it for many, many years.

Beautiful Window Treatments to Refresh Your Home
Sometimes you like your interior as bright and brilliant as the midday sun, but when you’re looking for an afternoon nap or a little added privacy, high-quality window treatments can be your best friend. Take control of your windows and dress up your favorite rooms with a beautiful selection of window coverings, curtains and drapes at JCPenney.

Not all blinds are equal: select a style that serves the purpose you’re looking for. Countless options are at your fingertips, from the elegant construction of sheer curtains to the modern appeal of Roman and cellular shades. Go natural with dark wood blinds or accessorize your preparation station with kitchen curtains that feature convenient sliding coverings on the bottom half.

These days, more and more people are finding creative ways to cut down on their utility bills. Take a chunk out of your monthly heating invoice with thermal curtains. These curtains ensure winter cold stays out and heat stays in. Save even more money with useful blackout curtains that will help to regulate temperature, sunlight exposure, and sound levels.  It's a window treatment that saves you money.

Find Valances for Any Room in Your Home
But there’s more to decorating than covering up. Valances can serve as gorgeous accents on windows you would rather not leave the hardware exposed. Choose from options like flowing waterfall valances, lace jacquard panels and voile window scarves and dress up your window. You can even complete your project with unique curtain rods with a wide variety of intricate features and materials.

Don't forget that you've got access to a wide variety of other interior decor, accents & furniture that can all help to tie your living space together. Take a look at our home collection to get started!

Shop snazzy dress shirts and high-quality ties that suit you well for any occasion.

From Athletic Clothes to Dress Clothes, Shop for Men's Clothes Online

Dri-FIT clothing quickly wicks away sweat from your body to keep you cool, and Therma-FIT keeps you toasty by preventing heat loss.

At JCPenney, finding the perfect gift at a great price is easier than ever! Surprise your friends and family with the season’s hottest holiday gifts.

4 Men’s Wardrobe Essentials
With our great selection of men’s clothing, you have a lot to choose from. Make sure your closet is filled with seven essential clothing items.

1. White and pale blue button down shirts will be your best friends. These tops can be dressed up and down numerous. Whether you wear them with jeans or your favorite suit, you’ll always look put together.

2. T-shirts can be worn with just about everything you own. Invest in several white-t shirts to wear underneath other clothing, alone, or as pajamas. Also add a few colored t-shirts to mix things up a bit. You’ll find men’s t shirts are especially handy in the wintertime as a layering option to place an additional barrier between yourself and the cold.

3. Trench coats are one of the most chic options you can keep your closet. When wearing a shirt and jeans, a trench coat will make the outfit look more pulled together. If you’re in your finest formal attire the timeless double breasted construction of a trench coat will only make you look more debonair. A black suit will be versatile until the end of time. There’s not much you can’t wear with a black suit. The key is finding the proper cut that looks best on you.

4. A leather jacket just exudes cool. It’s really easy to make a case for a leather jacket. Not only is it stylish but it’s extremely practical. It looks good with work and casual clothes. It’s warm, and as long as you treat it right, you’ll be able to wear it for many, many years.
