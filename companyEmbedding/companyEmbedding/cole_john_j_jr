Robinson+Cole Lawyers Join Annual Walk to the Hill
Katherine C. Bailey, Kendra L. Berardi, Lawrence P. Heffernan, John E. O’Brien, Jr., Kathryn M. Rattigan, and Elizabeth K. Wright represented the firm when they walked with hundreds of lawyers to the Massachusetts State House in the 17th Annual Walk to the Hill for Civil Legal Aid on January 28, 2016. At the State House, participants urged lawmakers to protect state funding for civil legal aid. Many low-income individuals need civil legal aid when they face various civil legal problems, such as loss of housing, domestic abuse, access to veterans' benefits, unemployment appeals, and wage and hour disputes. By providing lawyers and legal advice to people living at or near the federal poverty level, civil legal aid programs enhance the ability of clients to access justice and can serve as a powerful tool to combat poverty. Click here to view a photo of Robinson+Cole lawyers at the State House.The Walk to the Hill event was sponsored by the Equal Justice Coalition, the Massachusetts Bar Association, and the Boston Bar Association.

Despite Blizzard, Boston Lawyers Participate in Annual Walk to the Hill
The blizzard did not stop over 500 lawyers from trudging through the snow in the annual Walk to the Hill for Legal Aid on January 29, 2015. The lawyers represent bar associations from across Massachusetts in support of the Equal Justice Coalition, the sponsor of the Walk to the Hill. Participating from the Boston office of Robinson+Cole were co-captains Carla M. Moynihan, Kendra L. Berardi, and Elizabeth K. Wright, along with Larry P. Heffernan and John E. O’Brien Jr. Civil legal aid is the last resort for low-income people when they face critical civil legal problems, such as loss of housing, domestic violence, access to veterans' benefits, unemployment appeals, and wage and hour disputes. By providing lawyers and legal advice to people living at or near the federal poverty level, civil legal aid programs enhance their clients' ability to access justice and can serve as a powerful tool to combat poverty. The Walk to the Hill means literally walking up Beacon Street to the Capitol on Beacon Hill to urge state representatives and senators to preserve funding for legal aid programs.

 John J. Pendergast, Jr.
Prominent Businessman and Civic Leader
Centerville, MA – John (Jack) J. Pendergast, Jr., 84, of Centerville passed peacefully on Monday April 24, 2017 with his wife, Ann Shirley, by his side.  He was born on July 21, 1932 the eldest son of Sylvia (Johnson) and John J. Pendergast, Sr.
Throughout Jack’s youth he worked in the family businesses as; beach and parking attendant at Jack’s Beach, night clerk at Trades Winds Inn and sales associate at Cape Cod Package Store, Inc., while making time to share his passion for boating, fishing, water skiing and swimming with others.

He graduated from Barnstable High School in 1950 and furthered his studies at Nichols College.  In 1951, Jack entered the U.S. Coast Guard where he continued to service others and stay connected to the sea.  He received a National Defense Service Medal and was honorably discharged in 1959.
Jack began his business career as an Independent Insurance Agent in 1955.  In 1957, he expanded into real estate by incorporating John J Pendergast, Jr Real Estate Co. He achieved Emeritus status after 40 years as a member of the National Association of Realtor, as well as Cape Cod & Islands Association of Realtors (CCIAOR). He was always a man of integrity with a strong work ethic.  In 1965 he became manager of Cape Cod Package Store, Inc. then transitioned to owner in 1977.  Jack grew the business and established himself as an alcohol beverage industry leader serving as past President and board member on the Massachusetts Package Store Association. He embraced technology which allowed him to grow his business and lead others. He developed long lasting relationships with sales persons, industry leaders, and employees and to many he was best known as “Mr. P”.
As a community leader, he was actively involved with the Centerville Civic Association, Centerville Board of Trade and Barnstable Youth Advisory Council, establishing the first “Cops in Shops” in the Town of Barnstable.  He advocated for public safety by supporting youth groups and activities like ‘Celebration’, which is an alcohol and drug free post prom party for graduating seniors. He graciously donated funds and his time to support various church and community events, such as ECHO, Centerville Home Week, 4th of July Parades, and Centerville Christmas Stroll, Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra, and BSO, Pops By the Sea.
The Pendergast’s were one of the founding families of Our Lady of Victory Church in 1957. As a devoted parishioner, he was a Faithful Navigator of the Knights of Columbus, a Treasurer (50+ years) of St. Vincent de Paul Society and a 4th degree Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.  His core beliefs were based on charity, unity, fraternity and patriotism. 
Jack married Ann Shirley in 1958, and they shared 58 glorious years of marriage. They enjoyed a full life together; raising their family, traveling as a couple, as well as with family and friends, hosting celebrations for family, relatives and employees. He was often found pulling pranks on friends accompanied by his contagious boisterous laugh. He was a kid at heart with boundless energy and love for others. He enjoyed time with family; skiing, swimming, golfing,  fishing, apple picking, sending roses on Valentine’s Day and cheering for his children and grandchildren at sporting events.
As a member of the Hyannisport Golf Club for 42 years, he enjoyed golf, as well as many social events with fellow members and family.  Jack was an avid sports fan and took great pleasure in tailgating with family and friends at New England Patriots and Red Sox games.
He lived life to the fullest despite his long time battle with skin cancer. His motto was, “We will rise above this!” and when asked how he was doing, he would answer “Never better”!  Despite life’s challenges he gained strength and support from his family, friends, OLV cancer support group and SPHONC (Support for People with Oral Head and Neck Cancer). He was a fighter to the end, “The Man with the Plan”, always with integrity and optimism.
Jack was predeceased by his parents Sylvia (Johnson) and John J Pendergast, Sr., his brother Peter M Pendergast and by his first wife Lorraine (Langhirt), mother of John J. Pendergast, III.
Jack is survived by his beloved wife of 58 years, Ann Shirley (DeGianton); children, John J Pendergast, III, Danette Atsalis (Silas), Terri Anne P Haidinger and (Bob), and Andrea L Pendergast (fiance' Steve); 8 grandchildren, John, Nikolas, Kristina and Andrew Atsalis and Jacqueline, Maria, Gregory and Michael Haidinger.  
Visiting hours will be held on Monday, May 1st from 4 -7 p.m. at Our Lady of Victory Church, 230 S. Main St., Centerville.  A funeral mass will be celebrated on Tuesday, May 2nd at 11:00 a.m. at Our Lady of Victory Church.  Burial will follow at St Francis Cemetery 355 Pine Street, Centerville.
In lieu of flowers Memorial donations may be made to, Our Lady of Victory St Vincent de Paul Society, 230 South Main Street, Centerville, MA 02632 or Saint John Paul II High School in memory of John J Pendergast, Jr Scholarship, 120 High School Road, Hyannis, MA 02601.          
Grateful thanks to Memorial Sloan Kettering, Massachusetts General Hospital, VNA Cape Cod, and Hope Health for years of compassionate medical care.
