The shares of common stock offered by this prospectus will be sold by the
selling shareholders, who will receive all of the proceeds from the sales of
such shares. The company will not receive any proceeds from the sale or
distribution of the common stock by the selling shareholders, but we will incur
all costs associated with this registration statement and prospectus. We will
receive gross proceeds of $842,660 if all of the warrants are exercised for cash
by the selling shareholders. We intend to use cash proceeds from exercises of
warrants for working capital and other general corporate purposes.


Our ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent on our
ability to differentiate our products and services, provide superior quality and
service, and maintain a competitive cost structure. Activity levels in our three
segments are driven primarily by current and expected commodity prices, drilling
rig count, oil and gas production levels, and customer capital spending
allocated for drilling and production. The regions in which we operate are
highly competitive. The competitive environment has intensified as recent
mergers among oil and gas companies have reduced the number of available
customers. Many other oil and gas service companies are larger than we are and
have greater resources than we have. These competitors are better able to
withstand industry downturns, compete on the basis of price and acquire new
equipment and technologies, all of which could affect our revenues and
profitability. These competitors compete with us both for customers and for
acquisitions of other businesses. This competition may cause our business to
suffer. We believe that competition for contracts will continue to be intense in
the foreseeable future.


Company Description
Flotek was originally incorporated under the laws of the Province of British
Columbia on May 17, 1985. On October 23, 2001, we approved a change in our
corporate domicile to Delaware and a reverse stock split of 120 to 1. On October
31, 2001, we completed a reverse merger with CESI. Since that


 date, we have
entered into the following acquisitions that were outside the ordinary course of
our business:

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report"), and in particular, Part I, Item 2 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions, 15 U.S.C. � 78u-5, of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Reform Act"). Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent the Company's current assumptions and beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside the Company's control. Such statements include estimates, projections, and statements related to Flotek Industries, Inc.'s ("Flotek" or "Company") business plan, objectives, expected operating results, and assumptions upon which those statements are based. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report. The forward-looking statements relate to future industry trends and economic conditions, forecast performance or results of current and future initiatives and the outcome of contingencies and other uncertainties that may have a significant impact on the Company's business, future operating results and liquidity. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by words including, but not limited to, "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "continue," "intend," "expect," "plan," "forecast," "project," and similar expressions, or future-tense or conditional constructions such as "will," "may," "should," "could," etc. The Company cautions that these statements are merely predictions and are not to be considered guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied. A detailed discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from forward-looking statements is included in Part I, Item 1A - "Risk Factors" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("Annual Report") and periodically in subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of this Quarterly Report, as well as the Annual Report. Phrases such as "Company," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Flotek Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Executive Summary Flotek is a global diversified, technology-driven company that develops and supplies oilfield products, services, and equipment to the oil, gas, and mining industries, and high value compounds to companies that make cleaning products, cosmetics, food and beverages, and other products that are sold in the consumer and industrial markets. The Company's oilfield businesses include specialty chemistries and logistics, downhole drilling tools, and production-related tools. Flotek's technologies enable customers to drill wells more efficiently, increase well production, and decrease well operating costs. The Company also provides automated bulk material handling, loading facilities, and blending capabilities. The Company sources citrus oil domestically and internationally and is one of the largest processors of citrus oil in the world. Products produced from processed citrus oil include (1) high value compounds used as additives by companies in the flavors and fragrances markets and (2) environmentally friendly chemistries for use in numerous industries around the world, including the oil and gas ("O&G") industry. Flotek operates in over 20 domestic and international markets, including the Gulf Coast, Southwest, West Coast, Rocky Mountains, Northeastern, and Mid-Continental regions of the United States ("U.S."), Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. Customers include major integrated O&G companies, oilfield services companies, independent O&G companies, pressure-pumping service companies, national and state-owned oil companies, and international supply chain management companies. The Company also serves customers who purchase non-energy-related citrus oil and related products, including household and commercial cleaning product companies, fragrance and cosmetic companies, and food manufacturing companies.  The operations of the Company are categorized into four reportable segments:   Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies designs, develops, and manufactures products that are sold to companies in the flavor and fragrance industries and specialty chemical industry. These technologies are used by beverage and food companies, fragrance companies, and companies providing household and industrial cleaning products.   Drilling Technologies rents, sells, inspects, manufactures, and markets downhole drilling equipment used in energy, mining, and industrial drilling activities.   Production Technologies assembles and markets production-related equipment, including the Petrovalve(R) product line of rod pump components, hydraulic pumping units ("HPU"), electric submersible pumps ("ESP"), gas separators, valves, and services that support natural gas and oil production activities.  Market Conditions   Federal, state, and local governmental actions that may encourage or discourage drilling activity,   Customers' strategies relative to capital funds allocations,   Weather conditions, and   Technological changes to drilling methods and economics.  Historical North American drilling activity is reflected in "TABLE A" on the following page.   Drilling products that improve drilling operations and efficiencies,   Chemistries that are economically viable, socially responsible, and ecologically sound, and   Production technologies that improve production and production efficiencies in maturing wells.  Market prices for citrus oils can be influenced by:   Weather related risks,   Health and condition of citrus trees (e.g., disease and pests), and   International competition and pricing pressures resulting from natural and artificial pricing influences.  Governmental actions may restrict the future use of hazardous chemicals, including, but not limited to, the following industrial applications:   O&G production operations, and   Non-O&G industrial solvents.

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, total average North American active drilling rig count decreased 57.8% when compared to the same period of 2015. Average North American oil drilling rig activity decreased by 58.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2016, when compared to the same period of 2015. Average North American natural gas drilling rig count decreased by 56.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. Sequentially, total average North American active drilling rig count decreased by 21.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.  Company's broad range of energy technologies, from chemistry to drilling and production technologies. Further decreases in exploration and drilling activity and in North American rig counts could cause further reductions in revenue and income from operations. Although the Company has seen demand for its oil and gas related products and services in North America impacted by these industry conditions, the Company continues to aggressively market its oil and gas based products and services including its Complex nano-Fluid(R) ("CnF(R)") chemistries, Teledrift(R) product line, Stemulator(R) product line, and the growing line of production technologies, and the Company expects to see increased market acceptance of these product lines.  approximately $7 million for completion of its Global Research & Innovation headquarters. The Company will remain nimble in its core capital expenditure plans, adjusting as market conditions warrant.   Three months ended March 31, 2016 2015 Revenue $ 72,289 $ 82,373 Cost of revenue 47,360 55,846 Gross profit 24,929 26,527 Gross margin % 34.5 % 32.2 % Selling, general and administrative costs 25,453 23,568 Selling, general and administrative costs % 35.2 % 28.6 % Depreciation and amortization 2,798 2,676 Research and innovation costs 2,256 1,572 Impairment of inventory and long-lived assets 40,435 - Loss from operations (46,013 ) (1,289 ) Operating margin % (63.7 )% (1.6 )% Interest and other expense, net (609 ) (632 ) Loss before income taxes (46,622 ) (1,921 ) Income tax benefit 16,437 406 Net loss $ (30,185 ) $ (1,515 ) Net loss % (41.8 )% (1.8 )%  Consolidated Results of Operations: Three Months Ended March 31, 2016, Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 Consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016, decreased $10.1 million, or 12.2%, versus the same period of 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by the continued decline in drilling activity throughout 2015 and 2016, as indicated by the 57.8% reduction in average North American rig count for the three months ended March 31, 2016, versus the same period of 2015. This resulted in significant reductions in customer demand and price concessions in our Drilling Technologies segment. Our Energy Chemistry Technologies segment experienced a less significant decline in revenues due to increased CnF(R) sales volumes and revenues. Additionally, our Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies segment saw a significant increase in revenues due to higher sales prices and volume increases.  Research and Innovation ("R&I") expense increased $0.7 million, or 43.5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in R&I is primarily attributable to new product development and Flotek's commitment to remaining responsive to customer needs, increased demand, continued growth of our existing product lines, and the development of new products which are expected to expand the Company's future product lines. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, as a result of changes in the oil and gas industry that have occurred since the beginning of 2016 and its corresponding impact on the Company's business outlook, the Company determined that within its Drilling Technologies segment the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets exceeded their respective fair values and that some inventory was either not usable in future operations or the carrying value exceeded its market value. In addition, as a result of the introduction of newer and proprietary technology, as well as lower demand for older technologies, the Company also evaluated its Production Technologies inventory for impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2016. As a result of these evaluations, the Company recorded impairment charges of $40.4 million in the first quarter of 2016.   Three months ended March 31, 2016 2015 Revenue $ 44,679 $ 46,643 Gross profit 18,769 16,100 Gross margin % 42.0 % 34.5 % Income from operations 8,013 6,821 Operating margin % 17.9 % 14.6 %  Energy Chemistry Technologies Results of Operations: Three Months Ended March 31, 2016, Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 Energy Chemistry Technologies revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016, decreased $2.0 million, or 4.2%, versus the same period of 2015, compared to a 57.8% decline in market activity as measured by average North American rig count. Flotek's Energy Chemistry Technologies segment outperformed these market indicators by continuing to aggressively promote the benefits of CnF(R) chemistries. CnF(R) sales volumes increased 138.0% (revenues increased 90.7%), compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increased sales of CnF(R) chemistries during the first quarter of 2016 was achieved by continuing to demonstrate the efficacy of its CnF(R) chemistries through comparative analysis of wells with and without CnF(R) chemistries, field validation results conducted by E&P companies, and its direct-to-operator sales program known as the Flotek Store(TM). Whether operators purchase directly from Flotek or continue to purchase from oilfield distribution and service companies, E&P operators are benefiting from increased price transparency and a more direct relationship with Flotek's technical expertise and supply chain. Non-CnF revenues declined approximately 64% due to reduced customer demand resulting from oilfield market conditions. Sequentially, revenues decreased $5.6 million, or 11.2%, versus the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a 26.8% decline in market activity as measured by average U.S. rig count. CnF(R) sales volumes decreased 7.3% (revenues decreased 6.5%) on a sequential basis.

	Flotek Industries, Inc. Announces Acquisition of International Artificial


	Lift, LLC, Expanding Floteks Production Technologies Platform



	HOUSTON, January 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/  Flotek Industries, Inc

	. (Flotek or the Company) (FTK) today announced it has
	entered into a Definitive Agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of International Artificial Lift, LLC (IAL).


	IAL is a
	developmental-stage company that specializes in the design, manufacturing and service of next-generation Hydraulic Pumping Units (HPU) that serve to increase and maximize production for oil and natural gas wells. Founded and led by Larry
	Best, a 40-plus year veteran of hydraulic and electrical computerized controls and lift systems, IAL has developed patented and patent-pending designs and technology that provide Flotek with proprietary advances in hydraulic lift and control
	systems.


	We are delighted to welcome Larry and his team to the Flotek family and look forward to adding IALs advanced hydraulic technology to
	our growing array of production technologies, said John Chisholm, Floteks Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Larrys experience and expertise as an innovator in hydraulic pumping and lift technology not only
	creates a technology advantage for Flotek but it also instantly expands Floteks market through Larrys contacts and reputation as a best-in-class hydraulic lift developer. This strategic acquisition also stands in support of our strategy
	to find leading niche technologies that will expand our market opportunities and that provide solid value for our shareholders.


	The acquisition of
	IAL provides Flotek with complete control over the manufacturing and service quality of a next-generation, proprietary design in the rapidly expanding Hydraulic Pumping Units market. The IAL/Flotek HPU design features continuous horsepower with a
	patent-pending synchronized lifting system that allows operators to produce more efficiently and at a significantly reduced cost compared to other hydraulic lift designs.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE





	January 28, 2015




	The IAL team is delighted to join the Flotek family which will allow us to accelerate
	the commercialization of the next-generation of Hydra-Lift pumping systems and assist John Chisholm, David McMahon and the team in their expansion of the production technologies business, said Larry Best, President of International Artificial
	Lift, LLC. We believe, regardless of the current market environment, that demand for efficient HPU systems will continue to grow meaningfully over the next several years, and the combination of IALs advanced hydraulic technologies and
	expertise with Floteks distribution network and reputation for providing superior service will prove to be very successful as this business further develops.


	Larry Best brings over 40 years of experience in the development, distribution and service of hydraulic and electrical systems to Flotek in both the energy
	and aerospace industries. Beginning in the early 1980s, Mr. Best developed advanced variable speed control and drive systems for controlling pump jacks and hydraulic systems to enhance production of maturing oil and gas wells. In 1996,
	Mr. Best became the general manager of Hydradine Hydraulics where he designed and developed hydraulic regen systems for testing helicopter transmissions, providing technology for companies such as Boeing, Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter.


	Longing to return to the oilfield, Mr. Best founded Chaparral Automation, LLC in 2006 where he and his team developed the Dura-Lift long stroke, heavy
	lift HPU with a patented hydraulic-electrical regen system with a variable speed pump control system. Chaparral was purchased by privately-held Global Oilfield Services, Inc. in 2009 which in turn was purchased by an international, integrated
	oilfield services company in 2011.


	In 2012, Mr. Best formed International Artificial Lift, LLC, again looking for ways to improve on precision
	pumping and control equipment used in oil and gas production. The result was the Hydra-Lift product line which features IALs patented new hydraulic accumulator and other proprietary components.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE





	January 28, 2015




	The products offered by IAL give Flotek a tangible competitive advantage, especially
	as the market for HPUs continues to grow, said David McMahon, Floteks Vice President of Production Technologies. The advances in hydraulic pumping technology  since the original units were introduced in the 1980s  have
	been driven by entrepreneurs of which Larry is among the best in the business. The IAL design focuses on providing precision pumping functions with the fewest components, creating a more reliable system with significantly less maintenance downtime
	at a very competitive price. It also creates a significantly smaller environmental footprint versus traditional pumping units. We look forward to combining Larrys expertise and superior technology with our distribution and service acumen to
	quickly become a meaningful player in the hydraulic lift business.


	Flotek provided total consideration of $2.25 million for the purchase of
	substantially all of the assets of IAL including all intellectual property, finished goods and inventory. Flotek also assumed the lease on IALs corporate headquarters in Boyd, Texas in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex. Mr. Best has agreed
	to remain with the Company for a minimum of two years from the effective date of the transaction.


	We look forward to introducing Larry and his team
	to our clients and stakeholders in the coming weeks and a successful commercial launch of the Hydra-Lift product lines, concluded Chisholm. While a small operation today, the technological advances seen in IALs hydraulics provide
	Flotek with an opportunity to become a difference maker in hydraulic lift in short order.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Annual Report.  Flotek operates in over 20 domestic and international markets. Customers include major integrated O&G companies, oilfield services companies, independent O&G companies, pressure-pumping service companies, national and state-owned oil companies, and international supply chain management companies. The Company also serves customers who purchase non-energy-related citrus oil and related products, including household and commercial cleaning product companies, fragrance and cosmetic companies, and food manufacturing companies. Continuing Operations   Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies designs, develops, and manufactures products that are sold to companies in the flavor and fragrance industries and specialty chemical industry. These technologies are used by beverage and food companies, fragrance companies, and companies providing household and industrial cleaning products.  Discontinued Operations   Production Technologies assembles and markets production-related equipment, including pumping system components, electric submersible pumps ("ESP"), gas separators, valves, and services that support natural gas and oil production activities.  Market Conditions  that influence the level of drilling and well completion activity include:   Federal, state, and local governmental actions that may encourage or discourage drilling activity,   Customers' strategies relative to capital funds allocations,   Weather conditions, and   Technological changes to drilling and completion methods and economics.  Historical North American drilling activity is reflected in "TABLE A" on the following page.   Chemistries that meet the need of consumer product markets, and   Chemistries that are economically viable, socially responsible, and ecologically sound.  Market prices for commodities, including citrus oils and guar, can be influenced by:   Weather related risks,   Health and condition of citrus trees and guar plants (e.g., disease and pests), and   International competition and pricing pressures resulting from natural and artificial pricing influences.  Governmental actions may restrict the future use of hazardous chemistries, including, but not limited to, the following industrial applications:   O&G production operations, and   Non-O&G industrial solvents.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TABLE A 2016 vs. 2015 % 2015 vs. 2014 % 2016 2015 2014 Change Change Average North American Active Drilling Rigs United States 509 978 1,862 (48.0 )% (47.5 )% Canada 130 192 379 (32.3 )% (49.3 )% Total 639 1,170 2,241 (45.4 )% (47.8 )% Average U.S. Active Drilling Rigs by Type Vertical 60 139 376 (56.8 )% (63.0 )% Horizontal 400 744 1,275 (46.2 )% (41.6 )% Directional 49 95 211 (48.4 )% (55.0 )% Total 509 978 1,862 (48.0 )% (47.5 )% Average North American Drilling Rigs by Product Oil 471 835 1,745 (43.6 )% (52.1 )% Natural Gas 168 335 496 (49.9 )% (32.5 )% Total 639 1,170 2,241 (45.4 )% (47.8 )%  Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (www.bakerhughes.com); Rig counts are the annual average of the reported weekly rig count activity.  [[Image Removed: ftk_10kx2016xchart-51944a02.jpg]][[Image Removed: ftk_10kx2016xchart-53665a02.jpg]] During the year ended 2016, North American drilling activity saw a significant decline compared to 2015 and 2014, but started to recover during the second half of the year. Total average North American active drilling rig count in 2016 decreased by 45.4% from 2015 and 47.8% from 2014 to 2015. Average North American oil drilling rig activity decreased by 43.6% in 2016 compared to 2015, and 52.1% from 2014 to 2015. Average North American natural gas drilling rig count decreased by 49.9% in 2016 compared to 2015, and 32.5% from 2014 to 2015. Average U.S. rig activity decreased by 48.0% in 2016 compared to 2015, and 47.5% from 2014 to 2015. Average Canadian rig count in 2016 decreased by 32.3% from 2015, and 49.3% from 2014 to 2015.  45.4% decline in North American general oilfield activity. Although quarter to quarter performance may vary, the Company expects its Energy Chemistry Technologies sales to outperform market activity metrics over time by continuing to demonstrate the efficacy of its CnF(R) chemistries through comparative analysis of wells with and without CnF(R) chemistries, field validation results conducted by E&P companies, and the continuation of its direct-to-operator sales program known as the Flotek Store(TM). Whether operators purchase directly from Flotek or continue to purchase from oilfield distribution and service companies, E&P operators are benefiting from increased price transparency and a more direct relationship with Flotek's technical expertise and supply chain. In July 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the stock and interests in International Polymerics, Inc. ("IPI") and related entities, a U.S. based manufacturer of high viscosity guar gum and guar slurry. The IPI business is being integrated into the Company's Energy Chemistry Technologies segment as an important part of the Company's expanding line of polymer based chemistries. The Company's success in promoting its patented and proprietary chemistries is supported through its industry leading research and innovation staff who provide customer responsive product innovation, as well as development of new products which are expected to expand the Company's future product lines. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed its new Global Research & Innovation Center in Houston. This state-of-the-art facility allows for the development of next-generation innovative energy chemistries, as well as expanded collaboration between clients, leaders from academia, and Company scientists. These collaborative opportunities are an important and distinguishing capability within the industry.  The outlook for the Company's consumer and industrial chemistries will be driven by the availability and demand for citrus oils, industrial solvents, and flavor and fragrance ingredients. Although current inventory and crop expectations are sufficient to meet the Company's needs to supply its flavor and fragrance business, as well as both internal and external industrial markets, the market supply of citrus oils has declined in recent years due to the reduction in citrus crops caused by the citrus greening disease. This reduced supply has resulted in higher citrus oil prices and increased price volatility. The Company expects terpene prices to remain elevated for the foreseeable future. However, the Company expects its strong market position to enable it to maintain a stable supply of citrus oils for internal use and external sales. The Company expects to manage the impact of increasing terpene costs through the development of new product formulations and pricing strategies.  Capital expenditures for continuing operations, exclusive of acquisitions, totaled $14.0 million in 2016, inclusive of $6.3 million for the completion of its Global Research & Innovation Center. The Company expects capital spending to be between $15 million and $20 million in 2017. The Company will remain nimble in its core capital expenditure plans, adjusting as market conditions warrant. Changes to geopolitical, global economic, and industry trends could have an impact, either positive or negative, on the Company's business. In the event of significant adverse changes to the demand for oil and gas production and/or the market price for oil and gas, the market conditions affecting the Company could change rapidly and materially. Should such adverse changes to market conditions occur, management believes the Company has access to adequate liquidity to withstand the impact of such changes while continuing to make strategic capital investments and acquisitions, if opportunities arise. In addition, management believes the Company is well-positioned to take advantage of significant increases in demand for its products should market conditions improve dramatically in the near term.

	Flotek Industries Announces Second Quarter Financial and Operating Results and Conference Call
	Information





	HOUSTON, August 7, 2013 /PRNewswire/  Flotek Industries, Inc. (NYSE: FTK) (Flotek or the
	Company) today announced results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.




	As reported on Form 10-Q filed with the
	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Flotek reported that revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was $93.6 million compared to $78.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012. Revenue in the second quarter
	increased $15.3 million when compared to the same period in the previous year.




	During the quarter, Flotek acquired Florida Chemical Company,
	Inc. (Florida Chemical). As a result of the acquisition, Florida Chemicals financial results for the months of May and June are included in Companys consolidated financial statements and provided $14.5 million in incremental
	revenue during the period.




	Excluding Florida Chemical revenue, Flotek would have reported revenues of $79.1 million for the three months
	ended June 30, 2013.




	For the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company reported net income of $8.4 million, or $0.16 per common
	share (fully diluted), compared to a net income of $13.2 million, or $0.25 per common share (fully diluted) for the same period in 2012.




	The second quarter of 2013 was and will continue to be a transformational tipping point in the history of Flotek Industries, said John
	Chisholm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Flotek. Not only did Flotek Classic post the second-best quarterly revenue in the Companys history, it also completed the single-most important acquisition in the
	Companys history in Florida Chemical. Not only does the Florida Chemical combination secure supply of the key ingredient in Floteks patented suite of advanced oilfield chemistries, it immediately provides a plethora of additional
	products to Floteks already robust chemical technology offerings. Moreover, it expands Floteks reach into key consumer markets and provides opportunities to intensify and reinvigorate our commitment to environmental stewardship in the
	oilfield. Most importantly, I believe it uniquely positions Flotek for significant growth for the balance of 2013 and beyond.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




	 








	 




	For comparison purposes, net income for the second quarter of 2012 included non-cash income of $6.5
	million related to the change in fair value of warrant liability, a result of securities issued in a preferred stock offering in 2009. Due to a change in terms of the remaining warrants, the Company no longer accounts for the securities as
	derivative instruments with fluctuating value. In addition, during the second quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a $1.0 million expense related to the extinguishment of debt. Excluding such items, net income in the period ending June 30,
	2012 would have been $7.6 million.




	Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure of financial
	performance), for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was $ 17.6 million compared to $ 23.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012. EBITDA for the period ending June 30, 2012 included the impact of both the change
	in fair value of warrant liability and extinguishment of debt as described above. Excluding those items, EBITDA for the second quarter of 2012 would have been $18.1 million.




	Stock compensation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2013 totaled $3.6 million compared to $3.7 million for the year-ago period. For the second quarter, 2013, non-cash stock compensation
	represented approximately 17% of total selling and administrative expense. A presentation of stock-based compensation and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA can be found at the conclusion of this release.




	A complete review and discussion of the Companys results for the three- and six-months ended June 30, 2013 can be found in the Companys
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.






	Acquisition of Florida Chemical






	On May 10, 2013, the Company acquired Florida Chemical Company, the worlds largest processor of citrus oils and a pioneer
	in solvent, chemical synthesis, and flavor and fragrance applications from citrus oils. Florida Chemical has been an innovator in creating high performance, bio-based products for a variety of industries, including applications in the oil and gas
	industry.




	The acquisition brings a collection of high performance renewable and sustainable chemistries into the Flotek portfolio in both the
	oil and gas industry as well as the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Moreover, the combination creates a more secure supply of key material inputs for Floteks patented, advanced chemistry applications for oil and gas drilling,
	completion and production.




	In addition, the combination of Florida Chemicals strong research expertise in bio-based, citrus molecular
	chemistry combined with Floteks acumen for advanced, practical chemistry applications across the hydrocarbon value chain creates a unique opportunity to become the global leader in products that not only stand in support of improved
	environmental stewardship in the energy industry but, more importantly, provide superior results for customers when compared to traditional chemical applications that have detrimental ramifications for the environment.

	Our principal rationale for enticing Florida Chemical into the Flotek family
	was to create certainty of supply for key citrus terpenes that stand in support of Floteks advanced CnF


	®


	chemistries, added Chisholm. While we were also attracted to their broader oilfield products as well as their industrial and consumer goods, our short time together convinces me that the combination of our two enterprises will produce
	more robust opportunities for new products, revenues and profits than we initially thought would be possible. Josh Snively and his team are world-renowned for their expertise in the energy space as well as other key industries. As we continue to
	integrate our teams  a process that to date is both smooth and swift  the opportunity to become a global leader in environmentally-friendly, bio-based chemical solutions for the energy industry should be the lasting legacy of this
	strategic business combination.




	In late July, Flotek filed the required pro forma financials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission in connection with the acquisition of Florida Chemical. Select pro forma financial information can also be found in the Companys quarterly report, filed today, with the complete filing available on Floteks website at

	www.flotekind.com

	.




	In conjunction with the filing of pro forma financial statements, the Company announced it has adjusted its
	business segment reporting to reflect the acquisition of Florida Chemical and more precisely describe the Companys existing business. In addition to Floteks three traditional segments, a new segment, Non-energy Chemical Technologies, has
	been added to capture Florida Chemicals non-energy specialty chemistry business.




	Flotek will now report results in four segments:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Chemical Technologies designs, develops, manufactures, packages and markets specialty chemicals, some of which hold patent protection, used in oil and
	gas well cementing, stimulation, acidizing, drilling and production. Activities in this segment also include construction and management of automated material handling facilities and management of loading facilities and blending operations for
	oilfield services companies.






	 





	 




	




	 





	The new segment, Non-energy Chemical Technologies, designs, develops and manufactures products that are sold to companies in the flavor and fragrance
	industry and specialty chemical industry. These technologies are used by beverage and food companies, fragrance companies, and companies providing household and industrial cleaning products.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Drilling Technologies rents, sells, inspects, manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment used in energy, mining, water well and industrial
	drilling activities.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Artificial Lift Technologies assembles and markets artificial lift equipment, including the Petrovalve product line of rod pump components, electric
	submersible pumps, gas separators, valves and other technologies and services that support natural gas, oil and coal bed methane production activities.

	Operations Update





	Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was $93.6 million compared to $78.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012. Revenue in the second quarter increased $15.3 million
	when compared to the same period in the previous year.




	As a result of the Florida Chemical acquisition, Florida Chemicals financial
	results for the months of May and June are included in Companys consolidated financial presentation, which provided $14.5 million in incremental revenue during the period. Excluding Florida Chemical revenue, Flotek would have reported revenues
	of $79.1 million.




	Consolidated margins for the three-months ended June 30, 2013 were 40.2% compared to 42.2% in the same period in 2012.
	The modest decline in gross margins was largely the result of a modest shift in product mix in both Chemical Technologies and Artificial Lift Technologies.




	Revenues in the Chemical Technologies segment for the three-months ended June 30, 2013 were $47.7 million compared to revenues of $46.0 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2012.
	Excluding the incremental revenue provided from the merger, Chemical Technologies segment revenues were relatively flat year-over-year.




	Chemical Technologies segment gross margins were 43.1% for the three-months ended June 30, 2013, a decline from 44.0% posted in the same period in
	2012. The modest change in margins  albeit from record levels  was primarily the result of product mix, including moderately lower margin contributions from production-related products acquired in the Florida Chemical acquisition.




	A slower-than-anticipated recovery in Canada combined with moderation of overall oilfield activity in North America
	largely explains subdued year-over-year growth in Chemical Technologies revenue in the second quarter. However, the marketing efforts related to the Companys core CnF


	®


	chemistries have resulted in a number of important new customer validations in the first six months of the year, which should result in increased market penetration
	in the second-half of the year.




	Moreover, the stability of margins  including modest sequential improvement  is evidence of the
	impact of improved marketing penetration and continued improvement in input pricing. The Florida Chemical acquisition should provide additional cost benefits in coming quarters.




	While we continued to feel the impact of slow seasonal recovery in Canada and more tempered domestic oilfield activity,
	interest in our advanced chemistry and opportunities for new business improved throughout the quarter, added Chisholm. Additionally, new data presented to clients in recent weeks combined with solid new well data from regions such as the
	Utica and the D-J Basin have presented new opportunities in recent weeks. While we have said that growth in CnF


	®


	technology revenues will be lumpy, we believe the second-half of the year will provide a host of exciting new
	opportunities for Flotek. Moreover, core margins remain at near-record levels, a trend we think can continue in the months ahead.

	August 7, 2013








	 




	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




	 









	 




	Non-energy Chemical Technologies (NECT) revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2013
	totaled $12.7 million. This segment, the result of the acquisition of Florida Chemical, debuts this quarter with all revenue incremental to the Company with no comparable data available.




	NECT revenue is primarily driven by demand for d-limonene (a citrus terpene derived from the processing of raw citrus oils) and other bio-based chemistries offered by the Company globally to a multitude
	of industries as well as from citrus isolates produced for the flavor and fragrance industry. Revenue results are subject to market seasonality and availability of raw materials.




	NECT gross margin for the second quarter and year to date periods ended June 30, 2013 was $3.7 million, or 29.1% of revenues. The primary drivers of the margin for the NECT segment are demand for the
	Companys bio-based chemistries and the high value flavor and fragrance isolates. The general direction of the citrus oil markets and seasonality of flavor compounds can also impact margin results.




	Contribution from the Non-energy Chemical Technologies segment are from May and June of 2013, the period for which Florida Chemical results were
	consolidated with Flotek upon closing of the acquisition.




	Drilling Technologies revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2013 totaled
	$29.8 million, relatively unchanged when compared to the year-ago period. Continued market penetration  especially with advanced technologies such as Teledrift and the Companys drilling motors  provided for relatively strong
	results, especially in an environment that saw an 11.0% decline in the U.S. active rig count and increased pricing pressures from competitors. Improved sales of centralizers, float equipment, and motor parts and equipment in the Northeast, Bakken,
	and Eagle Ford regions resulted from more competitive customer pricing due to better material outsourcing, new customer contracts and higher sales to existing customers.




	Drilling Technologies gross margin increased to 41.8%, up from 40.3% compared to the same period in 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased rental pricing, minimums on current motor rentals and
	on non-motor related rentals, and increased service charges with higher margins.




	The technical advances in Teledrift and continued
	improvement in performance of our drilling motors provided the backdrop for stellar performance in our Drilling Technologies group, added Chisholm. When we layer in incremental benefits from our new Stemulator technology and
	continued improvement in market penetration as a result of our infrastructure investments in Oklahoma and North Dakota, we believe the second-half of 2013 should build on the success seen in the second quarter.




	Revenue for the Artificial Lift Technologies segment for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 was $3.4 million compared to $2.5 million for the period
	ending June 30, 2012.

	Penetration of new oil markets as well as a modest rebound in the gas workover market provided
	additional revenue opportunities as have international sales. Margins in the quarter declined to 25.2% from 33.3% in the year-ago quarter, the result of a decline in valve sales into South American markets that hold higher-than-average margins.




	While I am pleased with what the Flotek team has accomplished in the first-half of 2013, there is much more for us to achieve in the
	second-half of the year, added Chisholm. That said, I am confident that our investment in exceptional people, state-of-the-art infrastructure and aggressive marketing will serve us well in the coming months. We are well positioned to
	succeed; we now must execute as we work tirelessly to create value for Flotek shareholders.




	As a result of new market development,
	extrinsic growth opportunities and the development of a high-performance team, the Companys sales and administrative costs rose during the period. SG&A expenses for the three-months ended June 30, 2013 were $21.1 million compared to
	$15.8 million for the same period in 2012. Included in those expenses were approximately $1.5 million in total costs related to the acquisition of Florida Chemical, approximately $0.5 million in expenses related to the development of new
	international markets, including its joint venture in Oman and new opportunities in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and $3.6 million in non-cash stock compensation expenses. SG&A expenses in second quarter of 2013 also included $1.7
	million recorded by Florida Chemical after the acquisition.




	Although administrative costs increased in the quarter, a significant
	portion is directly attributable to activities that serve to position Flotek for meaningful growth in the future, concluded Chisholm. Moreover, we are very pleased that the costs associated with the Florida Chemical acquisition were,
	all-in, well below our expectations and were fully expensed in the quarter.






	Financial Metrics






	Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 increased by $1.0 million or 93.0%, relative to 2012. This increase for the
	quarter was primarily attributable to incremental amortization of intangible assets recognized as part of the acquisition of Florida Chemical ($0.6 million). The remaining increase in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 is due to increased
	depreciation expenses resulting from capital asset additions during the second half of 2012, unmatched in the first half of 2013, related to the new ERP system and new corporate offices.




	Interest and other expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 decreased by $2.1 million, or 85.6%, compared to the same period a year ago. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to the
	repayment of the Companys convertible notes of $50.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and $5.2 million during the first quarter of 2013.

	Media Release




	 




	August 7, 2013








	 




	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




	 








	 




	The Company recorded an income tax provision of $4.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2013,
	corresponding to an effective tax rate of 35.9% compared to an income tax provision of $5.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, reflecting an effective tax rate of 29.2%. The income tax provision was $9.0 million corresponding to an
	effective tax rate of 35.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to an income tax provision of $7.1 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 29.6% for the comparable period in 2012. Fluctuations in effective tax rates were
	historically impacted by non-cash changes in the fair value of the Companys warrant liability, permanent tax differences with no associated income tax impact, and existing deferred tax asset valuation allowances.






	Project Updates






	In May, Flotek
	announced its intent to form a joint venture with an affiliate of Gulf Energy, an Omani integrated oilfield services concern to develop a chemical production and research effort in the Sultanate of Oman to serve the Middle East and North Africa.




	The Company is in the final stages of creating the legal joint venture entity, finalizing the Definitive Agreement between the parties and
	completing the legal transfer of real property into the joint venture entity. It is expected that the legal entity will be completed no later than the end of the third quarter, providing for the planning and development of the commercial facilities
	to begin, as originally anticipated, in the fourth quarter.




	We are enthused by the progress in our relationship with our Omani partner
	and look forward to completing the meticulous process of creating a durable partnership that provides incredible opportunities for both Flotek and Gulf Energy, said Chisholm. We have been very clear that we will not rush into an
	agreement without a thorough understanding of the structure and with certainty that it will stand to maximize value and minimize risk, especially when it is halfway around the world. The time and diligence we have spent to ensure those tenets are
	preserved will result in a better partnership, especially for Flotek.




	In the Chemical Technologies product
	development arena, Flotek continues to focus on the commercialization of the next generation of CnF


	®


	Chemistries. The Company is involved in a full-scale commercial test of its CnF 2.0 and expects to make key decisions regarding marketing strategy in the third quarter. Early results are encouraging and the Company believes the product
	should have commercial impact in the second-half of 2013.




	In addition, and as a direct result of the acquisition of Florida Chemical, Flotek
	is in the nascent stages of an aggressive marketing plan to replace the use of Xylene and related petrochemical solvents in oil and gas production. Through the development of citrus-based, non-toxic chemistries, the Company believes it has
	replacement products that provide effective alternatives to Xylene. With little marketing, Flotek recorded revenues of approximately $0.5 million in sales of the alternative product in July.




	The combination of Flotek and Florida Chemical is no better represented than in our successful quest to create alternatives to BTEX solvents used in oil and natural gas production, added
	Chisholm. We are in the very early innings of defining this vast market and best understanding how to capture share. However, given our safe and effective alternative, we are confident that this product will transform the way producers view
	oilfield solvents and should become a major product in Floteks portfolio of advanced oilfield chemistries.

	Media Release




	 




	August 7, 2013








	 




	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




	 








	 




	In the Drilling Technologies group, the Company continues to tweak the commercial offering of its new
	downhole agitation technology, the Stemulator. In addition to improving drilling performance in horizontal wells, the Stemulator will add the ability to monitor and record downhole performance. Various sizes of the Stemulator are
	in production and should provide commercial revenues for the Company in the second-half of 2013.




	While largely in the shadow of the
	Companys chemistry and downhole technology offerings, the Companys Artificial Lift segment should see meaningful growth in the second-half of the year through increased installations of its traditional products in oilier basins as well
	as the introduction of new products, including new lift systems and other components.




	The transformation of our artificial lift
	business is nothing short of remarkable and is the result of a focus on new technologies that have resulted from our careful assessment of market dynamics, added Chisholm. We expect nearly half of our Artificial Lift Technologies revenue
	to come from oil-based projects in 2013, a marked change from only 2% in 2008. While still a relatively small part of our overall technology portfolio, those who work in that business believe they will make a much larger contribution in the quarters
	and years to come.




	Floteks oilfield technology innovations are supported by an infrastructure portfolio that is quickly becoming
	the benchmark for the industry. The Companys $19 million capital budget includes completion of production, storage and transportation enhancements to the Companys primary chemistry production facility in Marlow, Oklahoma; the
	construction and development of a state-of-the art technology facility for Teledrift, Cavo motors and Floteks other drilling technologies in Moore, Oklahoma; the construction of a new facility to house the Companys expanding operations
	in North Dakotas Williston Basin; expansion of Florida Chemicals storage capacity in Waller, Texas; the development of expanded laboratory facilities in the Woodlands to support the combination of Flotek and Florida Chemicals
	advanced chemistry research; production of new Stemulator tools; and capital for expansions to meet growth in Non-energy Chemistry Technologies facilities in Florida and in Enhanced Oil Recovery infrastructure.




	While these results are a report of what we have done in the past, we are singularly focused on what the future holds for Flotek, concluded
	Chisholm. We have worked hard to position our Company for future success, and we believe our future begins today. We will focus on execution, efficient growth to maximize profits and continue to find ways to invest in our future to create
	value for you, our shareholders. We look forward to the journey over the next six months and into 2014.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
