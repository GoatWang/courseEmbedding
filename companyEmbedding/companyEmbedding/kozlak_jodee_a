Jodee Kozlak, who was Target Corp.’s human resources chief for the past nine years, will join Alibaba Group as global senior vice president of human resources, the Chinese e-commerce company announced Friday.
Target separately announced that it promoted Stephanie Lundquist, a human resources executive with a decade of experience at the Minneapolis-based retailer, to succeed Kozlak as HR chief.
With the move, Kozlak, 52, joins a company that is smaller than Target but one that is growing far more quickly and considered by investors to be much more valuable. Alibaba has dominated the Chinese e-commerce market for more than a decade. Its 2014 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange was the largest in U.S. history.


For Target, Kozlak’s departure marks another significant change in the group of executives who directly report to Chief Executive Brian Cornell, who has been with the company for 19 months.
The company’s human resources department becomes the fifth major unit with a leadership change since Cornell took over. He also hired a new chief financial officer, chief information officer and chief risk and compliance officer, and is looking for a chief merchandising officer. He created the role of chief operating officer, shifting finance chief John Mulligan into that job.
Kozlak became Target’s top human resources leader in March 2007, after serving as a senior vice president in the department for a year. She had previously been an executive and general counsel in the human resources unit.















        Tim Hollatz via Target
      

                  Stephanie Lundquist was promoted to senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Target Corp.
              


“Jodee’s contributions in the past 15 years have made a tremendous impact on Target and our team members globally,” Cornell said in a statement.

Kozlak joined the company in 2001 from the Minneapolis law firm of Greene Espel, where she was a partner. She has been active with a number of Twin Cities cultural and educational institutions, including the boards of the Guthrie Theater and the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. She is also on the board of C.H. Robinson, the logistics company based in Eden Prairie.
Lundquist, 40, was most recently senior vice president of human resources at Target and was responsible for personnel at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters as well as its operations in India.
“Stephanie has played a critical leadership role in Target’s transformation efforts, developing and initiating the human resources strategies necessary to drive long-term growth for Target,” Cornell said. “She’s been a leading voice as we push ourselves to think differently and work in new ways across Target.”
Lundquist wasn’t available for comment, a Target spokeswoman said, and Kozlak couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
At Alibaba, Kozlak is expected to play a key role in the company’s international expansion. The firm, which generated about $15 billion in revenue last year, provides software that is used by both consumers on smartphones and businesses in their data centers to facilitate transactions. Alibaba services are used by 450 million people daily. Its main shopping site, called Taobao, accounts for about 80 percent of all e-commerce transactions in China. Its Alipay financial payments system is ubiquitous in the country, used for purchases of all kinds and even to transfer money between people’s smartphones.

The firm now employs about 250 people in the U.S., chiefly in offices in the San Francisco area and Seattle with new ones to open in New York and Washington. Kozlak is likely to divide her time among the Bay Area, New York and the company’s headquarters in Hangzhou, China. She will report to Jane Jiang, who co-founded Alibaba with Chief Executive Jack Ma and is its HR chief, and to Michael Evans, the company’s president.
The firm is trying to attract more American businesses to sell products to Chinese consumers, an effort that is driving its expansion in the U.S.

Jodee Kozlak, who was Target Corp.’s human resources chief for the past nine years, will join Alibaba Group as global senior vice president of human resources, the Chinese e-commerce company announced Friday.
Target separately announced that it promoted Stephanie Lundquist, a human resources executive with a decade of experience at the Minneapolis-based retailer, to succeed Kozlak as HR chief.
With the move, Kozlak, 52, joins a company that is smaller than Target but one that is growing far more quickly and considered by investors to be much more valuable. Alibaba has dominated the Chinese e-commerce market for more than a decade. Its 2014 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange was the largest in U.S. history.


For Target, Kozlak’s departure marks another significant change in the group of executives who directly report to Chief Executive Brian Cornell, who has been with the company for 19 months.
The company’s human resources department becomes the fifth major unit with a leadership change since Cornell took over. He also hired a new chief financial officer, chief information officer and chief risk and compliance officer, and is looking for a chief merchandising officer. He created the role of chief operating officer, shifting finance chief John Mulligan into that job.
Kozlak became Target’s top human resources leader in March 2007, after serving as a senior vice president in the department for a year. She had previously been an executive and general counsel in the human resources unit.

                  Stephanie Lundquist was promoted to senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Target Corp.
              


“Jodee’s contributions in the past 15 years have made a tremendous impact on Target and our team members globally,” Cornell said in a statement.

Kozlak joined the company in 2001 from the Minneapolis law firm of Greene Espel, where she was a partner. She has been active with a number of Twin Cities cultural and educational institutions, including the boards of the Guthrie Theater and the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. She is also on the board of C.H. Robinson, the logistics company based in Eden Prairie.
Lundquist, 40, was most recently senior vice president of human resources at Target and was responsible for personnel at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters as well as its operations in India.
“Stephanie has played a critical leadership role in Target’s transformation efforts, developing and initiating the human resources strategies necessary to drive long-term growth for Target,” Cornell said. “She’s been a leading voice as we push ourselves to think differently and work in new ways across Target.”
Lundquist wasn’t available for comment, a Target spokeswoman said, and Kozlak couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
At Alibaba, Kozlak is expected to play a key role in the company’s international expansion. The firm, which generated about $15 billion in revenue last year, provides software that is used by both consumers on smartphones and businesses in their data centers to facilitate transactions. Alibaba services are used by 450 million people daily. Its main shopping site, called Taobao, accounts for about 80 percent of all e-commerce transactions in China. Its Alipay financial payments system is ubiquitous in the country, used for purchases of all kinds and even to transfer money between people’s smartphones.

The firm now employs about 250 people in the U.S., chiefly in offices in the San Francisco area and Seattle with new ones to open in New York and Washington. Kozlak is likely to divide her time among the Bay Area, New York and the company’s headquarters in Hangzhou, China. She will report to Jane Jiang, who co-founded Alibaba with Chief Executive Jack Ma and is its HR chief, and to Michael Evans, the company’s president.
The firm is trying to attract more American businesses to sell products to Chinese consumers, an effort that is driving its expansion in the U.S.

Alibaba Group Appoints Jodee Kozlak As Global Senior Vice President Of Human Resources






Business Wire




Feb 12, 2016 9:06 AM EST













 




























































  Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) announced today the appointment of Jodee Kozlak as Global Senior Vice President of Human Resources. Ms. Kozlak will be responsible for helping to build Alibaba Group's international leadership team as the company continues to expand globally. Jodee will jointly report to Alibaba Group Deputy Chief People Officer, Jane Jiang and to Alibaba Group President, Michael Evans.  Ms. Kozlak's appointment highlights Alibaba Group's strong commitment to globalizing its business. The company has made growing its business outside of China a top priority, and is also committed to significantly increasing cross-border trade between China and key markets.  Ms. Kozlak previously served as Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer for Target Corporation. She was a member of Target's executive leadership team for ten years, and she helped set the strategy for Target's global workforce of nearly 350,000 team members. While at Target, she had oversight for all leadership activities, enterprise talent management, organizational design and alignment, as well as team culture, labor and employment law and employment brand. Ms. Kozlak originally joined Target in 2001 and before joining Target, Ms. Kozlak was a partner in the litigation practice of Greene Espel, PLLP, specializing in corporate governance, complex business litigation and employment issues. She was also an associate at the global law firm Oppenheimer, Wolff & Donnelly and a senior auditor at Arthur Andersen & Co., both in the Minneapolis offices of these firms.  "Jodee is a proven leader who brings world-class business building experience, strategic talent management and leadership skills to Alibaba," said Mr. Evans. "She is an important addition to Alibaba as we continue to internationalize our company, and her deep experience across a diverse set of disciplines will be invaluable as we continue to build our global team. Jodee will help to promote and preserve Alibaba's proven winning culture."

Target HR Chief Jodee Kozlak Heads To Alibaba Retailer Promotes Stephanie Lundquist - DistilNFO Retail

























































 



DistilNFO  RetailDISTILNFO RETAIL ADVISORY 





Target HR Chief Jodee Kozlak Heads To Alibaba Retailer Promotes Stephanie Lundquist
February 16, 2016 





























Jodee Kozlak, who has been Target’s human resources chief for the past nine years, is heading to Alibaba Group as global HR chief.
Jodee Kozlak, who was Target Corp.’s human resources chief for the past nine years, will join Alibaba Group as global senior vice president of human resources, the Chinese e-commerce company announced Friday.
Target separately announced that it promoted Stephanie Lundquist, a human resources executive with a decade of experience at the Minneapolis-based retailer, to succeed Kozlak as HR chief.



With the move, Kozlak, 52, joins a company that is smaller than Target but one that is growing far more quickly and considered by investors to be much more valuable. Alibaba has dominated the Chinese e-commerce market for more than a decade. Its 2014 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange was the largest in U.S. history.
For Target, Kozlak’s departure marks another significant change in the group of executives who directly report to Chief Executive Brian Cornell, who has been with the company for 19 months.
The company’s human resources department becomes the fifth major unit with a leadership change since Cornell took over. He also hired a new chief financial officer, chief information officer and chief risk and compliance officer, and is looking for a chief merchandising officer. He created the role of chief operating officer, shifting finance chief John Mulligan into that job.
Kozlak became Target’s top human resources leader in March 2007, after serving as a senior vice president in the department for a year. She had previously been an executive and general counsel in the human resources unit.
“Jodee’s contributions in the past 15 years have made a tremendous impact on Target and our team members globally,” Cornell said in a statement.
Kozlak joined the company in 2001 from the Minneapolis law firm of Greene Espel, where she was a partner. She has been active with a number of Twin Cities cultural and educational institutions, including the boards of the Guthrie Theater and the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. She is also on the board of C.H. Robinson, the logistics company based in Eden Prairie.
Lundquist, 40, was most recently senior vice president of human resources at Target and was responsible for personnel at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters as well as its operations in India.
“Stephanie has played a critical leadership role in Target’s transformation efforts, developing and initiating the human resources strategies necessary to drive long-term growth for Target,” Cornell said. “She’s been a leading voice as we push ourselves to think differently and work in new ways across Target.”
Lundquist wasn’t available for comment, a Target spokeswoman said, and Kozlak couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
At Alibaba, Kozlak is expected to play a key role in the company’s international expansion. The firm, which generated about $15 billion in revenue last year, provides software that is used by both consumers on smartphones and businesses in their data centers to facilitate transactions. Alibaba services are used by 450 million people daily. Its main shopping site, called Taobao, accounts for about 80 percent of all e-commerce transactions in China. Its Alipay financial payments system is ubiquitous in the country, used for purchases of all kinds and even to transfer money between people’s smartphones.
The firm now employs about 250 people in the U.S., chiefly in offices in the San Francisco area and Seattle with new ones to open in New York and Washington. Kozlak is likely to divide her time among the Bay Area, New York and the company’s headquarters in Hangzhou, China. She will report to Jane Jiang, who co-founded Alibaba with Chief Executive Jack Ma and is its HR chief, and to Michael Evans, the company’s president.
The firm is trying to attract more American businesses to sell products to Chinese consumers, an effort that is driving its expansion in the U.S.

And that’s when it hit me – really hit me. I was totally overcommitted and it was within my control to change that.
You can’t do it all. But you can have it all.
It took me a long time to realize this. But in the end, it boils down to physics and the idea that “all” is a concept that is yours to define. There are 168 hours in a week. Not a minute more. And try as you might, you can only squeeze so much into a single day. Time is your most precious resource and so it’s important to learn to spend it wisely.
My “aha” moment came about ten years ago when I received a promotion. My kids were growing up and their schedules were getting crazy. My husband also worked and traveled. It was a Saturday morning and I was standing in my dining room, four different calendars splayed out across the table, trying to reconcile how I could be at four very different places that day. It was physically impossible. But more importantly, even if I could have bounced from event to event I wouldn’t have been engaged.
And that’s when it hit me – really hit me. I was totally overcommitted and it was within my control to change that. It was a very humbling feeling to know I just couldn’t give enough of myself to make good on all the things I agreed to do. So I owned this realization. I started by defining my core priorities and then I reduced and redefined (and in some cases outright resigned) my involvement in certain activities that were not core to the people and values most important to me. Up until that point, I’d been too willing to say “yes” and didn’t realize how essential it is to say “no.” Today, “no” is the most empowering word in my vocabulary, but learning to say it was really tough.
Success begets opportunities. The more successful you are, the more opportunities come your way. It feels good to be asked for your time and expertise. It can be flattering. Be it a board appointment, a big project or a mentorship opportunity, you want to contribute, to help out and pay it forward. But you also have to know when to pass and say “no.”
Some say a budget is a reflection of your priorities. Think of your calendar as a budget for your time. Decide what really matters to you most. Consider your total well-being – your family and friends, your health and finances, your career – and establish your core priorities.
Put those most important priorities on your calendar first. After that, you’ll see there’s little room left for what matters least. Keep checking in with yourself as moments in your life require you to shift focus from work to family and back again.
My son is now a junior in college. Our daughter will graduate from high school in June. For the past year, I’ve moved mountains to be able to attend as many of her sporting events as I can because, frankly, I missed some of my son’s events and really regret that.  When my daughter leaves for college in the fall, I’ll take another look at my core priorities and reassess my definition of “all” once again.
