SBH & Associates, Inc. has been representing top manufacturers in the Midwest since 1962. Originally SBH was founded as a Housewares agency to service the heavy concentration of Department Stores once based in the territory. SBH has evolved into an agency that services three distinct market segments, capitalizing on the diverse opportunities in our region.
 
We pride ourselves in being the consistent and stable face of our product lines in this rapidly changing market.  We have represented many vendor partners for over 20 years.   SBH is also an expert at pioneering new lines into new markets as well as  finding new areas for growth for well established product lines.
 
Our outside sales personnel have a combined experience of over 100 years in manufacturer's rep sales.  We understand the basis for our success is relationship selling.  We have established a great rapport with our customers large and small by understanding their needs and providing solutions to their challenges. 
 
Our inside staff has always been regarded as providing the best customer service in the business.  As more of our manufacturers are short handed, many of our customers rely on SBH to provide that important link between themselves and the manufacturers.
At SBH & Associates, Inc. we consider ourselves an extension of the vendors we represent.  We take pride in our rapid response to those vendors and work diligently to protect their interests.

Home Center/Hardware 
We consider the "MINK" states (MO, IA, NE, & KS) as one of the few remaining vital territories left in the country for reps servicing this class of trade. In addition to having one of the few remaining strong regional players in the Home Center industry, we are fortunate to also have a solid distributor base as well as an active COOP dealer base including the largest ACE member. With a strong growing customer base like this, the opportunities for our vendors in this sometimes overlooked region are plentiful.     
 
To support our efforts implementing sales initiatives at the store level, we established Service Plus, our in-store service division. Emphasizing sales over merely store maintenance, and focusing on only select manufacturers, Service Plus offers the best result-oriented based store service in the industry.
