FitLife Brands Launches New Forskohlin Lean & Tone™ Product






Business Wire




Dec 21, 2015 2:54 PM EST













 




























































  FitLife Brands, Inc. ("FitLife") (OTCBB:FTLF), an international provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health conscious consumers marketed under the brand names NDS Nutrition Products™ ("NDS") ( www.ndsnutrition.com), PMD® ( www.pmdsports.com), SirenLabs® ( www.sirenlabs.com), CoreActive® ( www.coreactivenutrition.com), Metis Nutrition™ ( www.metisnutrition.com), iSatori™ ( www.isatori.com) and BioGenetic Laboratories ( www.biogeneticlabs.com), today announced the rollout of its new Forskohlin Lean & Tone™ with ForsLean® weight loss product.  "We are very excited about the launch of our new Forskohlin Lean & Tone™ product," said John S. Wilson, CEO of FitLife Brands. "The new product will be launched under iSatori's BioGenetic Laboratories brand and will be sold exclusively in both GNC corporate and franchise stores. This launch is our first with an iSatori product and is indicative how we plan to leverage our strong relationship with GNC to quickly bring new products to market in both corporate and franchise locations across all of our brands. We have many new additional iSatori products in the late stages of development with plans to launch in early in 2016. We are excited about our ability to leverage the collective knowledge base of the combined companies to develop new products that fall in line with our strategy of building a portfolio of authentic and innovative, best-in-class nutritional supplement brands that have a strong value proposition for consumers as well as our distribution partners."  Forskohlin Lean & Tone™ utilized patented, researched and standardized ForsLean® to insure the absolute highest quality forskohlin (the active ingredient) possible. This particular Coleus forskohlii root is grown and cultivated under strict, sustainable conditions in Southern India so that the consistency of the growing conditions is well monitored. Forskohlin positively affects fat loss and the maintenance of muscle mass, which is the perfect recipe to reduce fat and maintain muscle tone. In simple terms, Forskohlin triggers a metabolic pathway to help your body release and burn fat more efficiently.

FitLife Brands To Showcase Products At The 2017 Europa Games In Dallas






Business Wire




Jun 15, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































  FitLife Brands, Inc. ("FitLife") (OTCBB:FTLF), an international provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health conscious consumers marketed under the brand names NDS Nutrition Products™ ("NDS") ( www.ndsnutrition.com), PMD® ( www.pmdsports.com), SirenLabs® ( www.sirenlabs.com), CoreActive® ( www.coreactivenutrition.com), Metis Nutrition™ ( www.metisnutrition.com), iSatori™ ( www.isatori.com), Energize ( www.tryenergize.com), and BioGenetic Laboratories, ( www.biogeneticlabs.com), today announced iSatori will attend and showcase its products at the 2017 Europa Games Expo on June 17 - 18 in Dallas, Texas. In light of the foregoing, the Company has chosen not to participate in this year's GNC franchise convention.  "Europa is the nation's industry-leading distributor of nutritional and sports supplements, sports drinks and accessories representing over 280 of the industry's best brands with over 6,300 SKU's and a national network of fulfillment centers," said John S. Wilson, CEO of FitLife Brands. "The Europa show is the largest of its kind with hundreds of wholesalers and retailers represented and presents a significant opportunity for us to engage with customers in an effort to increase our distribution footprint for iSatori. World-class iSatori athlete and four-time World's Strongest Man, Brian Shaw, will be on hand representing iSatori and showcasing our latest products."  "As stated in our first quarter release, we are continuing to face a challenging retail environment where many of our customers are choosing to hold less inventory," continued Mr. Wilson. "In light of the foregoing and numerous other factors, we have elected not to attend the 2017 GNC Global Conference/Franchise Convention. While not easy, this decision will enable us to strategically re-invest our efforts and resources to both build iSatori, and proactively support and expand opportunities with our GNC franchise partners to the benefit of all parties throughout the remainder of the year."

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score

Momentum Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
