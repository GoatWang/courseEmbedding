HERSHEY, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Hershey Company (NYSE: HSY) today announced that Leslie M. Turner 
      has been named Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 
      effective July 9.
    


      In her new role, Turner will lead Hershey’s legal, government relations, 
      corporate security and corporate secretary functions. She will report to 
      John P. Bilbrey, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Hershey 
      Company. She also will serve as a member of the company’s Global 
      Leadership Team.
    

      “Leslie has significant experience working closely with corporate 
      governance matters and brings a broad business orientation and diverse 
      global background to this role,” said Bilbrey. “She has a proven record 
      partnering with leaders and business units to drive strong results, and 
      she is adept at aligning legal strategy with strategic objectives and 
      building collaborative, business-focused legal teams.”
    

      Turner joins Hershey with 25 years of legal experience. She has served 
      as a senior legal executive providing strategic counsel, risk management 
      and policy advice to senior business leaders of Fortune 100 and 500 
      companies. Most recently, Turner served as Chief Legal Officer, 
      Coca-Cola North America (CCNA), a position she’s held since 2008. In 
      this position, she was responsible for leading the protection of 
      Coca-Cola’s brands, reputation, resources and people by promoting 
      governance in all company-related decision making. She also supported 
      the strategic direction of the North America Business Unit and its 
      growth initiatives by providing strategic advice, risk management and 
      counsel to CCNA’s president, leadership team and other cross-functional 
      business units. At Coca-Cola, Turner also led efforts to increase 
      capability and build a diverse talent pipeline within the legal function.
    

      “I am excited to join Hershey and look forward to the opportunity to 
      support some of the world’s best-known and beloved brands,” Turner said. 
      “Hershey has a long record of ethical leadership and a strong company 
      reputation, reflecting more than a century of doing well by doing good 
      in the communities where the company operates its businesses. I look 
      forward to being part of the team that will continue to drive Hershey’s 
      long-term global success.”
    

      Prior to Coca-Cola North America, Turner served as Associate General 
      Counsel for The Coca-Cola Company’s Bottling Investments Group. She 
      previously was a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Akin, Gump, 
      Strauss, Hauer & Feld, LLP. Earlier in her career, she served in 
      significant roles in government, including the assistant secretary for 
      the Office of Territorial and International Affairs, U.S. Department of 
      the Interior and later as counselor to then-Secretary Bruce Babbitt and 
      director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, U.S. Department of 
      the Interior.
    

      Turner is a member of the Board of Directors, Georgia Appleseed; the 
      Board of Visitors, Georgetown University Law Center; and a Trustee, 
      Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. She 
      received a Bachelor of Science from New York University, a J.D. from 
      Georgetown University Law Center and a Master of Laws in Law and 
      Government from American University, Washington College of Law.
