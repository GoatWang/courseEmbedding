The Notes to be offered have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any state securities laws.

Vivint Smart Home Introduces Vivint Smart Properties for Property Developers and Managers
Jun 20 17
Vivint Smart Home announced Vivint Smart Properties, the first comprehensive smart home solution designed for rental properties.  Available across the U.S. and Canada, Vivint Smart Properties enables property developers and managers to increase the value of their properties by adding smart home technology as an amenity for residents, while lowering costs with more efficient property management. Under the Vivint Smart Properties program, property managers of single-family rentals and multi-family apartments can select from a suite of professionally installed smart home products for their units, including smart locks, lights, doorbell cameras, indoor cameras, and thermostats. Using Vivint Site Manager, an interactive dashboard, property managers can manage tenant service requests and vacant units from anywhere. With remote control of unoccupied units, they can provide keyless entry for staff or contractors, as well as monitor energy use to save money. Property managers can easily onboard new residents by transferring control of a unit's smart home system. Once a unit is occupied, privacy of the resident is paramount.  While occupied, property managers can only access smart locks, and cannot regain full access of the system until the unit is vacated. Residents can then use smart home technology such as the Vivint Doorbell Camera to see, hear and talk to anyone on their front porch, as well as simultaneously unlock the front door or arm/disarm their security system.

      APX Group CFO Mark Davies commented, “We had a two-fold focus during the 
      first quarter of 2017: First, drive improvements in our operating 
      metrics, which we did with strong revenue growth, in particular through 
      our inside sales channel, a reduction in our subscriber acquisition cost 
      multiple, a significant year-over-year increase in Average Revenue per 
      New User and an improvement in customer attrition. Second, execute on 
      our IT and infrastructure improvements related to an SAP enterprise 
      resource planning system implementation, and the process changes and 
      system buildouts to facilitate the launch of Vivint Flex Pay, both of 
      which had successful initial rollouts.” Mr. Davies added, “We also 
      successfully completed a $300 million aggregate principal amount bond 
      offering, which was met with strong investor reception. In summary, we 
      believe we’re off to a good start to the year.”
    

Costs and Expenses


      Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 increased by 23.1%, 
      from $58.0 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $71.4 million. The 
      $13.4 million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an 
      increase of $7.4 million in personnel and related costs, $3.3 million of 
      equipment costs and $2.1 million for contracted services and information 
      technology costs to support the growth in the Total Subscribers. The 
      $3.3 million of equipment costs includes approximately $1.8 million of 
      equipment cost related to the upgrading of customers’ cellular radios 
      from 2G to 3G and certain other updates to their systems to support the 
      change in technology.
    

      Selling expenses, net of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, for 
      the first quarter of 2017, were $34.8 million compared to $28.9 million 
      for the same period in 2016. The 20.4% year-over-year increase in 
      selling expenses primarily attributable to $4.0 of personnel and related 
      costs, $0.8 million of lead generation costs associated with growth in 
      the inside sales new subscriber originations and $0.7 million in 
      information technology costs related to rolling out new iPads and credit 
      card reader devices for the direct-to-home sales representatives to use 
      with the Vivint Flex Pay program.
    

      General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, net of allocations, for the 
      first quarter of 2017 were $38.9 million compared to $30.4 million for 
      the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase of $8.5 million 
      was primarily due to an increase of $3.6 million in personnel and 
      related costs, $1.2 million for marketing expenses, $0.7 million of 
      information technology costs and $0.7 million of bad debt expenses.
    

Adjusted EBITDA and Net Loss


      Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 grew by 12.3% to $115.4 
      million on a net loss of $82.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of 
      $102.8 million on a net loss of $45.1 million for the first quarter of 
      2016.
    

Recent Developments


Vivint Flex Pay Plan


      On January 3, 2017, we announced the introduction of the Vivint Flex Pay 
      program which is expected to be our primary sales and pricing model 
      going forward. Under the Vivint Flex Pay plan, we launched two new 
      financing programs: (1) a consumer financing program with Citizens Bank, 
      N.A., in the first quarter of 2017, offering qualified customers in the 
      United States an opportunity to finance the purchase of products and 
      related installation used in connection with Vivint’s smart home and 
      security services and (2) a retail installment contract program ("RIC") 
      funded by Vivint, with respect to the purchase of products and related 
      installation to certain customers who do not qualify to participate in 
      the Citizens Bank, N.A. consumer financing program, but qualify under 
      our historical underwriting criteria. We may also establish credit 
      programs either directly or through an affiliate or pursuant to an 
      agreement with a third party to provide installment loans or similar 
      products to customers that do not qualify to participate in the consumer 
      financing program. Alternatively, customers may purchase the products 
      and related installation at the outset of the service contract with cash 
      or credit card.
    

      With the Vivint Flex Pay plan, customers pay separately for the products 
      and related installation and our service offerings. Under the consumer 
      financing program, qualified customers are eligible for installment 
      loans provided by a third party financing provider of up to $4,000 for 
      either 42 or 60 months. In connection with the consumer financing 
      program, a subsidiary of ours entered into an agreement with Citizens 
      Bank, N.A. pursuant to which Citizens will be the exclusive provider of 
      installment loans under the consumer financing program for our customers 
      who are eligible for such loans. Pursuant to the agreement with 
      Citizens, we pay a monthly fee to Citizens based on the average daily 
      outstanding balance of the loans provided by Citizens and we share with 
      Citizens liability for credit losses, with Vivint being responsible for 
      approximately 5% to 100% of lost principal balances, depending on 
      factors specified in the agreement. The initial term of the agreement is 
      five years, subject to automatic, one-year renewals unless terminated by 
      either party in accordance with its terms. We are initially offering 
      RICs for 42 or 60 month terms to certain customers who do not qualify to 
      participate in the consumer financing program, but qualify under our 
      historical underwriting criteria, and may establish credit programs 
      either directly or through an affiliate or pursuant to an agreement with 
      a third party to provide installment loans or similar products to such 
      customers.
    

Additional 2022 Notes


      On February 1, 2017, APX issued and sold an additional $300.0 million 
      aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior secured notes due in 2022 at 
      a price of 108.250%. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of 
      these notes was used to redeem $300.0 million aggregate principal amount 
      of the Company’s existing 6.375% senior secured notes due in 2019 and 
      pay the related redemption premium, as well as to pay all fees and 
      expenses related thereto and any remaining proceeds will be used for 
      general corporate purposes.
    

Strategic Retail Partnership with Best Buy


      On May 4, 2017, we announced that we have entered into a strategic 
      partnership agreement with Best Buy Stores, L.P., in which the parties 
      will jointly market and sell smart home products and services. Under the 
      terms of the agreement, Best Buy will offer certain Vivint smart home 
      products and services in approximately 400 Best Buy retail stores on or 
      before the first anniversary date of the agreement, with a continuing 
      rollout to a significant number of additional Best Buy stores by the 
      second anniversary date of the Agreement expected. We expect that Best 
      Buy will begin offering Vivint’s products in services in these stores in 
      the second or third quarter of 2017. The agreement also contains certain 
      exclusivity conditions to which the parties are subject. We expect to 
      devote significant management attention as well as significant capital 
      and other resources to our partnership with Best Buy over the course of 
      the agreement. Historically, we have primarily originated subscribers 
      through our direct-to-home and inside sales channels. There is no 
      assurance that our retail partnership with Best Buy or other third-party 
      distribution arrangements will become a significant source of subscriber 
      originations or revenue for us. There is also no assurance that Best Buy 
      will continue to distribute our products and services after the 
      expiration or termination of the Best Buy agreement. If the Best Buy 
      agreement expires or is terminated, or if Best Buy otherwise ceases to 
      distribute our products and services, we may not be able to establish 
      alternative retail distribution channels for our products and services.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This earnings release and accompanying conference call include certain 
      forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding, among 
      other things, our plans, strategies and prospects, both business and 
      financial, including without limitation with respect to the Vivint Flex 
      Pay plan and our partnership with Best Buy. Forward-looking statements 
      convey the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. 
      All statements contained in this earnings release other than statements 
      of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements are 
      based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Although we 
      believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or 
      suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot 
      assure you that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or 
      expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to 
      risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These statements may be preceded 
      by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” 
      “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” 
      “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or similar expressions.
    

      Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should 
      not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of this 
      date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, 
      in addition to those discussed in “Risk Factors” in our most recent 
      annual report on Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from 
      time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are available 
      on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, 
      could affect our future results and could cause those results or other 
      outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our 
      forward-looking statements:
    


        risks of the smart home and security industry, including risks of and 
        publicity surrounding the sales, subscriber origination and retention 
        process;
      

        the highly competitive nature of the smart home and security industry 
        and product introductions and promotional activity by our competitors;
      

        litigation, complaints or adverse publicity;
      

        the impact of changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer 
        preferences, local, regional, and national economic conditions, crime, 
        weather, demographic trends and employee availability;
      

        adverse publicity and product liability claims;
      

        increases and/or decreases in utility and other energy costs, 
        increased costs related to utility or governmental requirements;
      

        cost increases or shortages in smart home and security technology 
        products or components;
      

        the introduction of unsuccessful new products and services;
      

        privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the 
        loss of data; and
      

        the impact to our business, results of operations, financial 
        condition, regulatory compliance and customer experience of the Vivint 
        Flex Pay plan.
      


      In addition, the origination and retention of new subscribers will 
      depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, market 
      availability, subscriber interest, the availability of suitable 
      components, the negotiation of acceptable contract terms with 
      subscribers, local permitting, licensing and regulatory compliance, and 
      our ability to manage anticipated expansion and to hire, train and 
      retain personnel, the financial viability of subscribers and general 
      economic conditions.
    

      These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from 
      those implied by the forward-looking statements in this press release 
      are more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section in our most 
      recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other reports as such factors may 
      be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. These 
      risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive. We undertake no 
      obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, 
      whether a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except 
      as required by law.
    

Certain Definitions


      Total Subscribers – The aggregate number of active smart home and 
      security subscribers at the end of a given period
    

      Monthly Revenue per User (“RPU”) – The recurring monthly revenue billed 
      to a smart home and security subscriber
    

      Total Revenue per User – The aggregate RPU billed for all smart home and 
      security subscribers
    

      Average RPU (“ARPU”) – The Total RPU divided by Total Subscribers
    

      Average Revenue per New User (“ARPNU”) – The aggregate RPU for new 
      subscribers originated during a period divided by the number of new 
      subscribers originated during such period
    

      Attrition – The aggregate number of canceled smart home and security 
      subscribers during a period divided by the monthly weighted average 
      number of total smart home and security subscribers for such period. 
      Subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in accordance 
      with the terms of their contract, are terminated by us, or if payment 
      from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible (when at least four 
      monthly billings become past due). Sales of contracts to third parties, 
      and certain moves and takeovers are excluded from the attrition 
      calculation
    

      Net Subscriber Acquisition Costs – Defined as direct and indirect costs 
      to create a new smart home and security subscriber. These include 
      commissions, equipment, installation, marketing and other allocations 
      (G&A and overhead), less activation fees, installation fees and up sell 
      revenue. These costs also exclude residuals and long-term equity 
      expenses associated with the direct-to-home sales channel.
    

      Net Subscriber Acquisition Multiple – Defined as Net Subscriber 
      Acquisition Costs, divided by the number of net new subscribers 
      originated, and then divided by the ARPNU
    

      Adjusted EBITDA – Net Income (loss) before interest expense (net of 
      interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and 
      amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber 
      acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain 
      contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition 
      costs, stock-based compensation, and certain unusual, non-cash, 
      non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations 
      under the indentures governing our notes and the credit agreement 
      governing our revolving credit facility.
    

      Last Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA (“LQA Adjusted EBITDA”) – A 
      common industry measure used to reflect the step-function in earnings 
      during the sales season related to the subscribers generated from April 
      to August. LQA Adjusted EBITDA, calculated by multiplying Adjusted 
      EBITDA for the most recent fiscal quarter by 4, represents the ongoing 
      earnings power of Vivint’s current subscriber base and is potentially a 
      more relevant metric than LTM due to the recurring nature of the revenue 
      and expected earnings.
    

      Net Service Cost – Defined as total service costs, including monitoring, 
      customer service, field service and other allocations (G&A and overhead) 
      costs, less total service revenue divided by total service subscribers
    

      Net Service Margin – Defined as ARPU per subscriber less Net Service 
      Costs divided by ARPU
    

1 This earning release includes Adjusted EBITDA, a metric 
      that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
      Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See the “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP 
      Financial Measures” section at the end of this earnings release for the 
      definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly 
      comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental 
      measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, 
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
    

      “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) before interest 
      expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and 
      depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized 
      subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects 
      of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber 
      acquisition costs, stock based compensation, and certain unusual, 
      non-cash, non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant 
      calculations under the indentures governing our notes and the credit 
      agreement governing our revolving credit facility.
    

      We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to 
      provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, 
      and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the indentures 
      governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving 
      credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in 
      accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable 
      to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers 
      and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under 
      GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) 
      or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as 
      an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of 
      our liquidity.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total 
      revenues.
    

      See the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted 
      EBITDA to Net Loss, which we believe is the most comparable financial 
      measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

    Total Security and Home Automation Subscribers up 12.1% Year over Year
    


PROVO, Utah
--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

APX Group Holdings, Inc.

(“APX Group”, “Vivint” or the “Company”) today reported results for the first quarter ended
March 31, 2015
.


“We’re pleased with Vivint’s first quarter in terms of operational execution, financial performance and product development. Year over year revenue increased 15% and we added 25,000 net new subscribers in the quarter,” said
Todd Pedersen
, CEO of
APX Group
. Mr. Pedersen continued, “Consumer adoption of additional services continues to be very strong, driving our Average RMR per New Subscriber to
$61.46
this quarter, up 5.6% from Q1 2014. Our Sky Control SaaS operating system now has 193,000 users and the team continues to add functionality and features. Our high-speed wireless internet business is a key focus area and we opened
San Antonio, Texas
as our third market and drove 5,038 new customer originations during the quarter. We have plenty of work remaining to deliver in 2015, but we’re off to a strong start.”


APX Group
reported total revenue of
$149.9 million
for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015
, an increase of 14.9%, as compared to
$130.5 million
for the same quarter ended
March 31, 2014
. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by a 12.1% increase in the Company’s security and home automation subscriber base along with a higher percentage of customers in the portfolio subscribing to additional Smart Home services. The Company’s first quarter 2015 revenues also included growth in its wireless Internet services and activation fees, off-set by the negative effects of foreign exchange rates.


“We’ve been extremely focused on driving sustainable enterprise productivity and you can see the results of this work in our year over year Adjusted EBITDA growth of 14.2%,” said
Mark Davies
, CFO of
APX Group
. “Vivint’s Net Service Margin increased 400 basis points year over year, from 71.8% in the first quarter last year to 75.8% this year, as Net Service Cost per Subscriber dropped to
$13.82
from
$14.98
in the same quarter last year. Account attrition improved from 13.6% in Q1 2014 to 12.5% in the current quarter. Additionally, we saw significant sequential improvement in our wireless internet EBITDA loss, which dropped from
$3.9 million
in Q4 2014 to

Costs and Expenses


Operating expenses were
$51.3 million
for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015
, compared to
$41.3 million
for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily related to expenses associated with the ramping of our wireless Internet service, an increase in the inventory reserves associated with the restocking of pulled and returned equipment and obsolescence, which were partially offset by a reduction in vehicle operating expenses. Net Service Cost per Subscriber in the first quarter of 2015 decreased to
$13.82
from
$14.98
in the first quarter of 2014, providing a Net Service Margin of 75.8%, excluding operating expenses associated with our wireless Internet service.


Selling expenses, net of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, were
$25.3 million
for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015
compared to
$25.6 million
for the quarter ended
March 31, 2014
. The year over year decrease was primarily attributable to lower lead generation costs associated with our inside sales channel, partially offset by an increase in personnel and administration costs to support growth in the Company’s new subscriber originations. Vivint’s LTM Net Creation Cost Multiple as of
March 31, 2015
was 31.4x, excluding its wireless Internet service.


General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were
$28.2 million
for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015
, compared to
$25.1 million
for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily associated with facilities and information technology costs to support the growth in our security and home automation business, bad debt expense and cost for the wireless Internet business.


The Company’s net loss for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015
was
$50.3 million
compared to net loss of
$47.0 million
for the same period in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA

1

for the Company was
$89.3 million
for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015
, up 14.2% as compared to
$78.2 million
for the same period in 2014.


Liquidity


On
March 6, 2015
, the Company amended and restated its credit agreement for the revolving credit facility to provide for, among other things, an increase in the aggregate commitments previously available to the Company from
$200.0 million to $289.4 million
and the extension of the maturity date with respect to certain of the available commitments.


As of
March 31, 2015
, the Company’s liquidity position on a consolidated basis, defined as cash on hand, marketable securities and available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility, was approximately
$271 million
.


Certain Credit Statistics


Our net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA, was 5.8x at
March 31, 2015
.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States
(“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA, is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States
. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, stock based compensation, the historical results of our Solar variable interest entity and certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes, the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about flexibility under our covenants to investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies since these groups have historically used EBITDA-related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions, and to evaluate a company’s ability to meet its debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the effect of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, much of which results from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates the effects of interest rates and changes in capitalization which management believes may not necessarily be indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by us to measure covenant compliance under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes, the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility.


See the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss, which we believe is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

        Quarter 2015

May 03, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



PROVO, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--APX Group Holdings, Inc. (“APX Group,” “Vivint” or the “Company”) 
      today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
    


      “We are pleased with our first quarter 2016 operating results, and I 
      believe Vivint has carried the momentum we had in 2015 into 
      calendar-year 2016,” said Todd Pedersen, CEO of APX Group. “Our Inside 
      Sales Team had a strong quarter, and our direct-to-home preseason 
      indicators are trending nicely. Inside sales have been a particular 
      focus, as we work to drive subscriber growth to this lower creation cost 
      channel. We continue to move forward with our strategic initiatives, our 
      product and service platform is growing, and I’m optimistic on the 
      overall market trends within the Smart Home space.” Mr. Pedersen 
      continued, “We’re excited to have Peter Thiel and Solamere Capital 
      onboard as strategic equity investors. This strategic investment will 
      enhance our efforts to establish tech-based partnerships, and further 
      validates our vision, technology and competitive position. We have much 
      work to do in 2016, but we’re off to a good start.”
    

      APX Group reported total revenues of $174.3 million for the quarter 
      ended March 31, 2016, an increase of 14.5%, as compared to $152.2 
      million for the same quarter ended March 31, 2015. The $22.1 million 
      increase in total revenues was driven primarily by a 14.4% increase in 
      the Company’s smart home subscriber base and a 1.9% increase in Average 
      RMR per Subscriber to $55.27. The Company continues to drive higher 
      adoption rates of additional Smart Home services. For the quarter ended 
      March 31, 2016 the Smart Home adoption rate was 81.3%, up from 66.9% in 
      the quarter ending March 31, 2015. The Company’s first quarter 2016 
      revenues also included a $1.6 million year-over-year increase in 
      revenues from its wireless internet business. Revenue growth was 
      partially offset by a $1.4 million negative impact from foreign exchange 
      rates.
    

      “We continue to execute on key operating metrics,” said Mark Davies, CFO 
      of APX Group. “Our twelve-month Creation Cost Multiple declined 0.5x 
      from 31.4x in first quarter 2015 to 30.9x in first quarter 2016. Service 
      Cost per Subscriber remained within our target range, coming in at 
      $14.41, and we managed our service margins to 74% for the quarter. 
      Scaling G&A remains a priority and we chose to scale G&A at 
      approximately half the rate of revenue growth, with most of the growth 
      related to R&D.” Mr. Davies continued, “We’re pleased with the return on 
      our R&D investment, which has provided the catalyst for revenue growth, 
      Smart Home adoption and an increasing RMR. We did have a slight rise in 
      the twelve-month attrition rate during the first quarter; however, we 
      believe this is primarily due to the 2012 42-month contracts which came 
      to end of term during the quarter. Lastly, the shift to Inside Sales is 
      changing the quarterly seasonality of sales, but we don’t expect our 
      first quarter growth rate to continue throughout the course of the year.”

Costs and Expenses


      Operating expenses were $58.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 
      2016, compared to $51.3 million for the same period in 2015. The 13.1% 
      increase was a result of a 14.4% growth in the subscriber base which 
      resulted in increased personnel expenses associated with monitoring, 
      customer support and field service functions, offset by a reduction in 
      wireless internet operating expense. Net Service Cost per Subscriber for 
      the period ended March 31, 2016, was $14.41, up 4.3%, compared to $13.82 
      for the period ended March 31, 2015. The year over year increase was 
      primarily due to: Management's decision to invest more in service costs 
      to improve timeliness and quality of the customer experience; and first 
      quarter 2015 recorded abnormally low service costs as a result of hiring 
      challenges in our field service and customer care departments. Vivint’s 
      Net Service Margin was 73.8% for the quarter, excluding operating 
      expenses associated with the Company’s wireless internet service.
    

      Selling expenses, net of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, were 
      $28.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to $25.3 
      million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The 14.2% year-over-year 
      increase was primarily attributable to higher lead generation costs in 
      our Inside Sales channel to support the growth in new subscribers during 
      the quarter. Vivint’s twelve-month Net Creation Cost Multiple as of 
      March 31, 2016, improved 0.5x to 30.9x, excluding its wireless Internet 
      service.
    

      General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $30.4 million for the 
      quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to $28.2 million for the same 
      period in 2015. The 7.8% increase was primarily associated with an 
      increase in R&D personnel to support our product, cloud and other 
      technology initiatives.
    

      The Company’s net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, was $45.1 
      million compared to a net loss of $48.0 million for the same period in 
      2015. Adjusted EBITDA1 for the Company was $102.8 
      million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, up 14.9% as compared to 
      $89.5 million for the same period in 2015.
    

Liquidity


      As of March 31, 2016, the Company’s liquidity position on a consolidated 
      basis, defined as cash on hand, marketable securities and available 
      borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility, was 
      approximately $248 million.
    

      Subsequent to the quarter, on April 25, 2016, the Company’s parent 
      completed the issuance and sale to certain investors, co-led by Peter 
      Thiel and strategic investment firm Solamere Capital, of a series of 
      preferred stock in a private placement exempt from registration under 
      the Securities Act. On April 29, 2016, the Company’s parent contributed 
      the net proceeds of $69.8 million from such issuance and sale to us as 
      an equity contribution.
    

      As this issuance is the first installment of a total equity capital 
      raise that is expected to be in the aggregate amount of $100 million, 
      the Company’s parent intends to issue and sell additional shares of 
      preferred stock in one or more private placements exempt from 
      registration under the Securities Act and to use proceeds from such 
      additional issuances to make additional capital contribution(s) to us of 
      up to $30 million in 2016. No assurances may be given that these 
      additional transactions will be completed on the timeline contemplated, 
      in the amount contemplated or at all, or that any resulting net proceeds 
      would be contributed to us.
    

      The Company’s pro-forma liquidity would have been $318 million including 
      the $69.8 million equity contribution.
    

Certain Credit Statistics


      Our net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net debt to LTM Adjusted 
      EBITDA, was 5.5x at March 31, 2016, improved 0.3x from the quarter 
      ending March 31, 2015. The Company’s pro-forma net leverage ratio would 
      have been 5.3x including the $69.8 million equity contribution.

      defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 
      including statements regarding, among other things, our plans, 
      strategies and prospects, both business and financial. Forward-looking 
      statements convey the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of 
      future events. All statements contained in this earnings release other 
      than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These 
      statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. 
      Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations 
      reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are 
      reasonable, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or realize these 
      plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are 
      inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These 
      statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words 
      “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” 
      “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or 
      “intends” or similar expressions.
    

      Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should 
      not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of this 
      date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, 
      in addition to those discussed in “Risk Factors” in our most recent 
      annual report on Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the Securities 
      Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from time to 
      time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are available on the 
      SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, 
      could affect our future results and could cause those results or other 
      outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our 
      forward-looking statements:
    


        risks of the security and smart home industry, including risks of and 
        publicity surrounding the sales, subscriber origination and retention 
        process;
      

        the highly competitive nature of the security and smart home industry 
        and product introductions and promotional activity by our competitors;
      

        litigation, complaints or adverse publicity;
      

        the impact of changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer 
        preferences, local, regional, and national economic conditions, crime, 
        weather, demographic trends and employee availability;
      

        adverse publicity and product liability claims;
      

        increases and/or decreases in utility and other energy costs, 
        increased costs related to utility or governmental requirements; and
      

        cost increases or shortages in security and smart home technology 
        products or components.
      


      In addition, the origination and retention of new subscribers will 
      depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, market 
      availability, subscriber interest, the availability of suitable 
      components, the negotiation of acceptable contract terms with 
      subscribers, local permitting, licensing and regulatory compliance, and 
      our ability to manage anticipated expansion and to hire, train and 
      retain personnel, the financial viability of subscribers and general 
      economic conditions.
    

      These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from 
      those implied by the forward-looking statements in this press release 
      are more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section in our most 
      recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other reports as such factors may 
      be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. These 
      risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive. We undertake no 
      obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, 
      whether a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except 
      as required by law.
    

Certain Definitions


      The following definitions are used in this press release for purposes of 
      describing the results in our home security and automation business and 
      except where noted, exclude our wireless internet business.
    

      “Total Subscribers” means the aggregate number of active smart home and 
      security subscribers at the end of a given period.
    

      “RMR” means the recurring monthly revenue billed to a smart home and 
      security subscriber.
    

      “Total RMR” means the aggregate RMR billed to all smart home and 
      security subscribers.
    

      “Average RMR per Subscriber” means the Total RMR divided by Total 
      Subscribers. This is also commonly referred to as Average Revenue per 
      User, or “ARPU.”
    

      “Average RMR per New Subscriber” means the aggregate RMR for new 
      subscribers originated during a period divided by the number of new 
      subscribers originated during such period.
    

      “Attrition" means the aggregate number of canceled smart home and 
      security subscribers during a period divided by the monthly weighted 
      average number of total smart home and security subscribers for such 
      period. Subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in 
      accordance with the terms of their contract, are terminated by the 
      Company, or if payment from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible 
      (when at least four monthly billings become past due). Sales of 
      contracts to third parties and certain moves are excluded from the 
      attrition calculation.
    

      “Net Subscriber Acquisition Costs” means direct and indirect costs to 
      create a new smart home and security subscriber. These include 
      commissions, equipment, installation, marketing and other allocations 
      (G&A and overhead), less activation fees and up sell revenue. These 
      costs also exclude residuals and long-term equity expenses associated 
      with the direct-to-home sales channel.
    

      “Net Creation Cost Multiple” means total Net Subscriber Acquisition 
      Costs, divided by the number of new subscribers originated, and then 
      divided by the Average RMR per New Subscriber.
    

      “Net Service Cost per Subscriber” means total service costs for the 
      period, including monitoring, customer service, field service and other 
      allocations (G&A and overhead) costs, less total service revenue for the 
      period divided by total service subscribers.
    

      “Net Service Margin” means the average RMR per subscriber for the period 
      less Net Service Costs divided by the average RMR per subscriber for the 
      period.
    

1 This earning release includes Adjusted EBITDA, a metric 
      that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
      Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See the “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP 
      Financial Measures” section at the end of this earnings release for the 
      definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly 
      comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental 
      measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, 
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
    

      “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) before interest 
      expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and 
      depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized 
      subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects 
      of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber 
      acquisition costs, stock based compensation, the historical results of 
      Solar and certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring and other items 
      permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indentures 
      governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving 
      credit facility.
    

      We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to 
      provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, 
      and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the indentures 
      governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving 
      credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in 
      accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable 
      to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers 
      and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under 
      GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) 
      or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as 
      an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of 
      our liquidity.
    

      See the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted 
      EBITDA to Net Loss, which we believe is the most comparable financial 
      measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

            Reflects subscriber acquisition costs that are expensed as

            of specific subscribers. Certain other industry participants 
            purchase subscribers through subscriber contract purchases and, as 
            a result, may capitalize the full cost to purchase these 
            subscriber contracts, as compared to our organic generation of new

Press Release Details
APX Group Holdings, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2014 Results


08/06/2014

Download this Press Release (PDF 554 KB)

Provo, UT – August 6, 2014 – APX Group Holdings, Inc. (“APX Group” or the “Company”) today reported results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2014. APX Group reported total revenue of $134.2 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 17.4%, as compared to $114.3 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2013. Revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2014 was $264.4 million, up 10.8% compared to $238.7 million for the same period of 2013. Net of the sale of 2GIG Technologies, Inc. in the first quarter of 2013 (the “2GIG sale”), year-to-date revenue increased by 19.5%. Revenue growth was a result of an increase in the subscriber base of nearly 97,000 and a higher Average RMR per Subscriber of $53.84. The increase in Average RMR per Subscriber was driven by the growth in the take-rate for additional service and product offerings by our new subscribers.  
“The launch of our new Vivint.Sky cloud operating system and the new SkyControl Panel in the second quarter continues to demonstrate our ability to deliver innovation as the leader in the Smart Home revolution,” said Todd Pedersen, CEO of APX Group. Mr. Pedersen continued, “The new panel and cloud have been very well received by our customers.  As evidence of this point, in the second quarter we achieved a customer take-rate for additional services of over 73%, resulting in an all-time high Average RMR per New Subscriber of more than $61. In fact, 100% of our new customers enjoy full Smart Home functionality.”
“While we generated a respectable 19.5% revenue growth, net of the 2GIG Sale, for the first half of 2014, we were slightly below our expectations,” said Mark Davies, CFO of APX Group.  ”Specifically, our Inside Sales channel encountered some headwinds due to the Google organic search penalty and in our Direct-to-Home channel we had a higher percentage of inexperienced sales reps compared to last year.  From an expense perspective, both our G&A and operational cost structures are on track and we continue to drive improvement in our customer attrition rate.” 
“On the strategic front, we are making good progress with our Wireless Internet initiative and continue to invest in this promising new business.”  Mr. Davies added, “It is also worth noting that during the quarter we implemented a significant upgrade to our CRM and billing systems, which provides scalability and enhanced functionality as we expand our service and product offerings.”

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA, is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, stock based compensation, the historical results of our Solar variable interest entity and certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes, the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about flexibility under our covenants to investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies since these groups have historically used EBITDA-related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions, and to evaluate a company’s ability to meet its debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the effect of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, much of which results from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates the effects of interest rates and changes in capitalization which management believes may not necessarily be indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by us to measure covenant compliance under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes, the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. 
 
See the tables below for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss, which we believe is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 (Amounts in millions) 
(Unaudited)



 
 (i)      Excludes loan amortization costs that are included in interest expense. 
(ii)      Reflects subscriber acquisition costs that are expensed as incurred because they are not directly related to the acquisition of specific subscribers. Certain other industry participants purchase subscribers through subscriber contract purchases and, as a result, may capitalize the full cost to purchase these subscriber contracts, as compared to our organic generation of new subscribers, which requires us to expense a portion of our subscriber acquisition costs under GAAP. 
(iii)     Reflects non-cash compensation costs related to employee and director stock and stock option plans. 
(iv)     Non-recurring gain on the 2GIG Sale. 
(v)      Bonuses and transaction related costs associated with the 2GIG Sale.
(vi)    Other Adjustments including certain items such as product development costs, fire related expenses, subcontracted monitoring fee savings, and other similar adjustments
