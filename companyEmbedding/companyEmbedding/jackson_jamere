Positioning Finance to Generate Growth: Nielsen CFO Jamere Jackson







Jamere Jackson
Jamere Jackson, CFO of Nielsen Holdings plc, has three short-term priorities for his finance team: Focus on allocating resources to deliver on strategic objectives, become more digitally enabled to drive efficiencies and develop into growth leaders. “Having a technical mastery is table stakes for members of the Nielsen finance team,” says Mr. Jackson, who took over as CFO at the consumer measurement and analytics company two years ago.
“I want people who are focused on growing the business in addition to handling their typical fiduciary responsibilities,” he adds. Mr. Jackson discusses how the finance team helps drive business performance, the strategic role he plays in investor and board relations, and how lessons from his time as a Division I college athlete sharpened his leadership skills, among other issues.
Q: How does the finance organization partner with the business to drive performance?
Jamere Jackson: We’re at the table from the start, helping the businesses think through strategic alternatives and growth opportunities, and making sure that as we allocate resources we have a view of business priorities. I personally spend time with our operations team on Nielsen’s current growth strategy, as well as growth over the next three, five and 10 years.
I also play an active role in what our CEO, Mitch Barns, calls “center edge balance,” which is maintaining equilibrium between what happens at the center of our company—the C-suite and other corporate functions—and what happens at the edge of our company—the business units in the field. The goal is to strike the appropriate balance between ideas, strategy, execution and tactics. That requires having finance business partners that are in the 100-plus countries where we operate to help business teams execute on strategy.
Often, finance business partners are the people we’ve hired locally, typically a division CFO or a financial analyst, who is intimately familiar with our business in a specific country and understands local business practices and growth opportunities. We want them to be full-fledged business partners and not just focused on accounting, reporting, controllership and compliance. We want them to be involved in corporate and commercial strategy, such as how we price our products and allocate capital and resources to the business units.
Q: What role do you play in investment and acquisition decisions, particularly in light of the pressures of a quickly evolving market?
Jamere Jackson: One of my key roles as chief financial officer is to help manage capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy is based on growing our business and returning cash to shareholders in an investor-friendly way. The way you earn the ability to spend capital is demonstrating that you’re going to deliver an acceptable return on that investment. In addition, as part of the leadership team, finance often has to make informed estimates about our future and generating returns. That’s why it’s so important to be a business partner, which allows finance to spend time with the operating teams and clients, and with the marketplace so we understand where the industry is headed. We don’t always operate with perfect information, but the more engaged we are with internal and external operations the better chance we have of capital making the right decisions to invest capital in the right places.
Q: How do you balance the shorter-term view that is typically taken by investors and analysts in the United States with the longer-term view that stakeholders outside the U.S. might take?
Jamere Jackson: The only way that I can convince an investor that I’m going to deliver in the long term is by putting numbers on the scoreboard in the short term that gives them some confidence that I’ll be able to achieve long-term objectives. We can’t be conflicted about the notion of whether decisions are good for the short- or long-term; they have to be good for both. I’ll give you an example. We invested in a technology platform for digital ad ratings in the 2010-2011 timeframe when the market was very fragmented and there wasn’t a big business opportunity that we could clearly identify. But we were convinced that media fragmentation was going to hit the industry in a big way and digital viewing was going to accelerate in the future. We had to stay focused on our strategy to measure the consumer rather than a particular distribution channel. We placed a bet well ahead of the market opportunity materializing, and we did that with conviction. Five years later, the opportunity is here and we’re executing on it effectively in the marketplace.
Another example is what we’ve done in emerging markets. In light of rising populations, emerging middle classes and urbanization, we doubled down on investments in emerging economies ahead of opportunities and reduced our operating margins as a total company for a period of about three years. We explained to investors that the payoff would be future growth opportunities. The strategy required discipline, stamina and the courage to make those kinds of decisions through market cycles. From my view, it was the right long-term move. The last seven quarters we’ve seen margins come back, and our businesses in emerging markets grow by 8% to 10%.
Q: While Nielsen is known for its ratings business, what is your role in educating investors about its information and analytics capabilities?
Jamere Jackson: I spend time on the road with investors at least twice a quarter where I’m talking about the latest financial results and spreading the gospel about what we are and what we aspire to be in the future. Also, we’ve made a concerted effort over the last couple of years to have other voices tell that story. Those voices come from our product leadership group and technology operations teams. It’s important to allow our key external stakeholders and shareholders to see the depth and breadth of the talent inside Nielsen. When investors get to see that next tier of leaders talking about where Nielsen is and where we’re going, it gives them confidence in the things that the CEO and I have been saying. There’s no better way to illustrate the bench strength of a company than putting rising leaders in front of investors and other stakeholders. Allowing them to go into depth about our strategy, products and emerging industry trends complements the financial story that’s part of our investor roadshows.
Q: How do you work with the board?
Jamere Jackson: While I report the financial results, I also take the lead in helping the board understand the strategic choices we’re making, what they mean for Nielsen financially and the marketplace implications. The CEO and I collaborate to develop the board agenda. Then I work with individual business leaders to prepare them for conversations with the board, coaching them on the material and the level of conversation so information is communicated in a way that’s clear, crisp and concise. I also focus on what I call “winning in the offseason.” I build relationships with individual directors outside the boardroom to discuss what we’re working on, why we’re making certain choices, and getting counsel from them on how to think about creating a faster-growing, higher-margin company.
Q: What lessons from the hardwood as captain of Notre Dame’s basketball team have you brought to your business career?
Jamere Jackson: When I think about taking on challenges inside Nielsen, everything starts with being properly prepared. In sports you train for big moments. In business, you’re spending time with your teams and clients to understand what’s going on in the marketplace so when you have to make big decisions, you have the experiences and preparedness that you need to be able to execute. So number one is being prepared.
Second is the importance of teamwork and collaboration. With a global finance organization of more than 700 people we have to operate as one team, collaborating, playing to the team’s strengths and sharing best practices across our organization and the finance function to be successful.
The third lesson is getting to know the people on your team. I spend a lot of time with our senior leadership and invest time getting to know individuals who work deep within our organization. We have employee resource groups focused on diversity and inclusion, and I’m a champion for many of those efforts. I also spend time with our finance councils, where I bring our top finance leaders together with talent two, three or four levels below the CFO level so they have an opportunity to meet in person and discuss business. I also have CFO dinners quarterly to bring top talent into our headquarters to expose them to how things work at the corporate level and to hear from them about what’s going on in the field.
The final lesson is to have fun. When you’re playing sports, and particularly if you’re winning, you’re having fun. I want our teams to enjoy helping our clients win in the marketplace. I’ve found that when teams are prepared, collaborating and have opportunities to get to know each other, they’re much more productive.

As Sustainability Takes Root, Finance Takes Notice

                          Until recently, sustainability has not been viewed as a strategic priority for finance. But proponents of sustainability—including investors, consumers, regulators and others—are demanding that companies think more broadly about the impacts their operations and decisions have on the environment and society. Emerging standards not only simplify sustainability reporting but may also provide companies with insights that can improve performance. Learn about these standards and related steps CFOs can take to incorporate sustainability reporting into both risk-management and value-creation activities.

Four Ways CFOs Can Avoid a Digital Talent Crunch

                          Technology is redefining how work gets done, both in the back office and in frontline operations.

Learn how CFOs can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership, culture, skills development and engagement.
                        



Keeping Finance Talent Relevant to Changing Needs: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          It’s no secret that talent is key to a CFO’s success, yet talent is a perennial top challenge for CFOs. That’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team, says Charles Holley, an independent senior advisor to Deloitte. Drawing on his extensive leadership experiences, he explains how to identify, recruit and develop the people best suited for the fast-changing demands of finance. The key, he says, is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business.
                        



FP&A: Why Talent Counts and What CFOs Can Do to Improve It

                          To elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s FP&A team can make, CFOs should focus on developing the team’s technical, professional and leadership competencies. Specifically, they can use a four-part model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decision-makers and the expectation that FP&A will function more strategically. Rotating talent from FP&A into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success.
