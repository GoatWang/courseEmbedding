The Gospel of Matthew and Judaic Traditions












A Relevance-based Commentary






 



Go to Online Edition






Herbert W. Basser, Ph.D University of Toronto, 1983 with Marsha B. Cohen, Ph.D Florida International University, 2007





In The Gospel of Matthew and Judaic Traditions, Herbert W. Basser, with the editorial help of Marsha Cohen, utilizes his encyclopaedic knowledge of Judaism to navigate Matthew’s Gospel.  This close, original reading explicates Matthew’s use of Jewish concepts and legal traditions that have not been fully understood in the past. Basser highlights Gospel sources that are congruent with a wide swath of extant Jewish writings from various provenances. Matthew affirms Jesus’ end-of-days—the coming of the Kingdom—salvation message:  initially meant for Jews, it is the Gentiles who embraced his message and teachings that encouraged their faith and simple trust.  Matthew’s literary art manages to preserve the Jewish details in his sources while disclosing an anti-Jewish and pro-Gentile bias.

Studies in Matthew's Gospel












Literary Design, Intertextuality, and Social Setting






 



Go to Online Edition






Wim J.C. Weren, Tilburg University





These Studies in Matthew’s Gospel by Wim J.C. Weren are the result of scholarly work carried out using recent methods in Biblical exegesis such as structural analysis, text semantics and intertextuality. Part One presents a new proposal regarding the macrostructure of Matthew’s Gospel and discusses meanings of textual units from this Gospel on the basis of synchronic research. In Part Two, intertextual theories are described and practical tools are developed that enable us to identify various types of relations between texts from Matthew’s Gospel and co-generic or co-thematic textual units from the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint and early Jewish and early Christian writings. Part Three answers the question to what extent the ways in which the disciples are portrayed in Matthew is related to ‘real’ groups in the Matthean communities. The three successive steps are deliberately chosen and are in a complementary relationship to each other.

Navigating the Chiral Pool in the Total Synthesis of Complex Terpene Natural ProductsZachary G. Brill, Matthew L. Condakes, Chi P. Ting, and Thomas J. Maimone*  Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United StatesChem. Rev., Article ASAPDOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00834Publication Date (Web): March 15, 2017Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society*E-mail: maimone@berkeley.edu.BiographyZachary Brill received his B.A. in chemistry (summa cum laude) from Columbia University in 2012, where he conducted research in the lab of Prof. Scott Snyder. As an undergraduate, he completed the total synthesis and structural revision of the resveratrol dimer caraphenol B and pursued the synthesis of the unusually strained halogenated sesquiterpenoid aplydactone. In 2012, he began his graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, with Prof. Tom Maimone. Continuing his pursuit of total synthesis, his work at Berkeley on complex polycyclic terpenes has explored the use of tandem radical cyclization cascades in the construction of ophiobolin sesterterpenes.BiographyMatthew Condakes received his A.B. and A.M. degrees in chemistry summa cum laude from Harvard University in 2014. While an undergraduate there, he conducted research on the synthesis of novel macrolide antibiotic analogues under the guidance of Prof. Andrew Myers. His passion for complex molecules then led him to pursue graduate work with Prof. Tom Maimone at the University of California, Berkeley, as an NSF predoctoral fellow. At Berkeley, his work has focused on developing innovative synthetic strategies and methodologies—efforts that recently culminated in an oxidative synthetic strategy toward the Illicium sesquiterpenes.BiographyChi P. Ting was born in Hong Kong, and grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He received a B.S. degree in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he worked under the direction of Prof. Steven Zimmerman. In 2012, he began his Ph.D. studies at the University of California, Berkeley, as a founding member of the Maimone research group. His graduate work has explored concise total synthetic routes to podophyllotoxin, hyperforin, berkeleyone A, and garsubellin A.BiographyTom Maimone received a B.S. degree in chemistry from UC—Berkeley (2004), where he was introduced to organic chemistry research in the laboratory of Prof. Dirk Trauner. From 2005 to 2009 he was a member of Prof. Phil Baran’s research group at The Scripps Research Institute, and from 2009 to 2012, an NIH postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Steve Buchwald’s lab at MIT. In 2012, he returned to UC—Berkeley as an assistant professor in the area of natural products total synthesis.AbstractThe pool of abundant chiral terpene building blocks (i.e., “chiral pool terpenes”) has long served as a starting point for the chemical synthesis of complex natural products, including many terpenes themselves. As inexpensive and versatile starting materials, such compounds continue to influence modern synthetic chemistry. This review highlights 21st century terpene total syntheses which themselves use small, terpene-derived materials as building blocks. An outlook to the future of research in this area is highlighted as well.View: ACS ActiveView PDF | PDF | PDF w/ Links | Full Text HTML
