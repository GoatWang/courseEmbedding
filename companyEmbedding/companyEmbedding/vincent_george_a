Pairs nicely with the Masculine Wave.Beautiful!These prints are just what I wanted and came framed and matted beautifully. They finished my bathroom remodel perfectly.Charming picture!Great pictures, colors are as depicted.  Great print, nice frame.  Definitely reccommend  this print.Beautifully Done!Nice quality print with beautiful frame for the money! Better than anticipatedThese are elegant prints, beautifully framed.  I couldn't be more pleased with them.Fabulous printGreat price for a framed print. Shipped quickly and was extremely easy to hang. Very solid craftsman ship. Beautiful This print was even more beautiful in person excellent framing top quality and looks amazing in our home!Luv this I purchased this print for my bedroom.  The colors are vibrant and the print itself is different from anything you would find in a store.  I plan on changing the frame and replacing it with something a little more expensive.  This print is definitely an attention grabber.Lovely painting, ugly frameThe plain black frame is not very appealing, but the print itself is beautiful (Morisot is a favorite of mine).  Some day when I have cash to spare, I will re-frame it. But for now, it's fine.

Jazz HeroAuthor: Vincent, George[33323]
$0.99













Click to enlarge



"Jazz Hero" is a simple Latin-rock chart that will do your band proud. A minor-sounding introduction brings the band in on the major-chord melody, and then the sections trade back and forth. There is an open solo section with a written-out solo for all winds, which allows you to select an individual, a section, or the entire band to be featured. Painless trumpet range to written D fourth line, along with easy rhythms, mean this chart will sound really good really fast.
