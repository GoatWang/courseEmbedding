SGA has extensive experience with numerous types of financing vehicles for its municipal clients including tax-exempt and taxable municipal bond issues, variable rate demand bonds, pooled financings, private placements, direct bank loans and direct bank purchase bonds.

Arbitrage Rebate
SGA provides arbitrage rebate services for many of its municipal clients. Services include an analysis of all existing and/or prior tax-exempt transactions to determine all necessary rebate calculations, annual arbitrage rebate liability calculations, preparation of an annual arbitrage rebate report detailing cumulative rebate liability across all bond issues, and assistance with budgeting for future liability payments.

In this capacity, SGA certifies the arithmetical accuracy of certain calculations of the bond financing, including the arbitrage yield and the sufficiency of the escrow. 
Bond Proceeds Reinvestment
SGA provides a full range of bond proceeds reinvestment services. We provide our clients with market expertise to achieve optimal results within the constraints of the permitted investments. SGA represents the borrower and coordinates the bond reinvestment process with other professionals including bond counsel, underwriter, paying agent, rating agency(s) and bond insurer to evaluate specific requirements associated with the investment of bond proceeds. Services provided include education on available investment options, structuring advice, evaluation of permitted investments and assessment of borrower policies and risk tolerance, preparation of all bid material and coordination with bond professionals, and bid execution, documentation and closing.

Hedge Effectiveness Testing
SGA performs annual hedge effectiveness testing for many of its municipal clients with outstanding derivatives transactions to comply with GASB 53. SGA tests existing derivatives using the four methods for evaluating hedge effectiveness under GASB 53 to determine if interest rate swaps are hedging derivative instruments or investment derivative instruments.
