“Better than Expected...”


Reviewed May 22, 2017




My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel while seeing a concert at Levi Stadium. It was the only hotel within walking distance of the stadium that was still available at the time of our booking. We weren't too excited, but the hotel staff was eager to please and took care of our check-in and had us in our room quickly. We had no issues, and the coffee and "to go" breakfast was appreciated. Completely adequate for our needs.

“Avoid this hotel”


Reviewed May 19, 2017




This is a cheap hotel, in the worst sense of the term. It is ill equipped and uncomfortable. There is no room cleaning service, no hairdryer, no coffeemaker, the rooms have a kitchen however no utensils, cups.... you have to request everything from the front desk. We did request a coffee maker however this was an ancient machine that belonged in a garage sale.The bathroom fan was tremendously noisy and long overdue for replacement.While we were there they were changing out the room furniture and the replacements were dusty.The hotel is located right next to (feet away from) a railway line that carries heavy freight trainsThe hotel has a "grab and go" breakfast buffet, which basically comprises a couple of pots of coffee, some granola bars and prepackaged muffinsAll this for $250 per night (inc tax) !!

We sincerely apologize for your disappointing stay. Please know, our housekeeping service is designed for long-term guests, offering minimal intrusion to their home-like stay, but we are happy to offer this service to you at a minimal fee. Our guests often bring their own bath amenities such as hairdryers and toiletries, so that's why these items are available at the front desk. Kitchenware for your suite is also available there. We are sorry if we didn’t communicate this to you during check-in. We value your feedback and will use it to ensure we are more consistent in our service levels. We regret the inconvenience caused and hope you will consider giving us another chance on your next trip to the area.Sincerely,General Manager

“Extend your life and don't stay here!”


Reviewed May 13, 2017




I have over 25 years on the road and this was the worst hotel place I have ever stayed at. The paint was coming off the wall in spots, the room was filthy, and the furniture has seen better days. That is not to mention the train that zipped by my room until 9:45 PM and started again very early in the morning. The hotel is only 100 feet or so from the tracks. The hallways stunk and I mean they were bad. The bed was like a rock and the linens did not look like they were clean. I will never stay at this place again.

“Surprise Backup”


Reviewed March 14, 2017




After my third-party booking site overbooked my stay at the Aloft Santa Clara, the staff at Aloft arranged for a very pleasant stay at the Extended Stay America. Check-in and checkout was simple and my room was on the second floor. For a budget hotel, everything was pretty top-notch. Absolutely no dirt, insects, or filth of any kind. Room comes standard with a kitchenette and a huge refrigerator. Bathroom was well stocked and clean. Bed not the best in the world, but comfortable enough for a good night's sleep. No hair or foreign substances anywhere! Extended Stay will never be my first choice, but for my first hotel providing excellent customer service they did not do bad all! Train noise in the night is out of control. I usually wear ear plugs at night and that noise easily broke through my silicone barriers. I wasn't sleep at the time, but I imagine if I were I'd be awakened immediately. If you're a light sleeper, this isn't the place for you.

“Better than Expected...”


Reviewed May 22, 2017




My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel while seeing a concert at Levi Stadium. It was the only hotel within walking distance of the stadium that was still available at the time of our booking. We weren't too excited, but the hotel staff was eager to please and took care of our check-in and had us in our room quickly. We had no issues, and the coffee and "to go" breakfast was appreciated. Completely adequate for our needs.

“Avoid this hotel”


Reviewed May 19, 2017




This is a cheap hotel, in the worst sense of the term. It is ill equipped and uncomfortable. There is no room cleaning service, no hairdryer, no coffeemaker, the rooms have a kitchen however no utensils, cups.... you have to request everything from the front desk. We did request a coffee maker however this was an ancient machine that belonged in a garage sale.The bathroom fan was tremendously noisy and long overdue for replacement.While we were there they were changing out the room furniture and the replacements were dusty.The hotel is located right next to (feet away from) a railway line that carries heavy freight trainsThe hotel has a "grab and go" breakfast buffet, which basically comprises a couple of pots of coffee, some granola bars and prepackaged muffinsAll this for $250 per night (inc tax) !!

We sincerely apologize for your disappointing stay. Please know, our housekeeping service is designed for long-term guests, offering minimal intrusion to their home-like stay, but we are happy to offer this service to you at a minimal fee. Our guests often bring their own bath amenities such as hairdryers and toiletries, so that's why these items are available at the front desk. Kitchenware for your suite is also available there. We are sorry if we didn’t communicate this to you during check-in. We value your feedback and will use it to ensure we are more consistent in our service levels. We regret the inconvenience caused and hope you will consider giving us another chance on your next trip to the area.Sincerely,General Manager

“Extend your life and don't stay here!”


Reviewed May 13, 2017




I have over 25 years on the road and this was the worst hotel place I have ever stayed at. The paint was coming off the wall in spots, the room was filthy, and the furniture has seen better days. That is not to mention the train that zipped by my room until 9:45 PM and started again very early in the morning. The hotel is only 100 feet or so from the tracks. The hallways stunk and I mean they were bad. The bed was like a rock and the linens did not look like they were clean. I will never stay at this place again.

“Surprise Backup”


Reviewed March 14, 2017




After my third-party booking site overbooked my stay at the Aloft Santa Clara, the staff at Aloft arranged for a very pleasant stay at the Extended Stay America. Check-in and checkout was simple and my room was on the second floor. For a budget hotel, everything was pretty top-notch. Absolutely no dirt, insects, or filth of any kind. Room comes standard with a kitchenette and a huge refrigerator. Bathroom was well stocked and clean. Bed not the best in the world, but comfortable enough for a good night's sleep. No hair or foreign substances anywhere! Extended Stay will never be my first choice, but for my first hotel providing excellent customer service they did not do bad all! Train noise in the night is out of control. I usually wear ear plugs at night and that noise easily broke through my silicone barriers. I wasn't sleep at the time, but I imagine if I were I'd be awakened immediately. If you're a light sleeper, this isn't the place for you.

“Not a hotel it's for workers”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




They tell you nothing and only clean the room after 6 days. Not a place for a family. The breakfast is a granola bar but the coffee is okay. You have to read their minds and ask for everything. We don't recommend it.

Thank you for your feedback. We were disappointed to read that we did not live up to our typical standards, and we are truly sorry your stay was anything less than exceptional. Please know, our housekeeping service is designed for long-term guests, offering minimal intrusion to their home-like stay, we are happy to offer this service to you at a minimal fee. Kitchenware for your suite is available and kept at the front desk to ensure cleanliness. We hope you will consider giving us a second chance in the future so we can prove this is not typical of our usual service.Sincerely,General Manager

“Better than Expected...”


Reviewed May 22, 2017




My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel while seeing a concert at Levi Stadium. It was the only hotel within walking distance of the stadium that was still available at the time of our booking. We weren't too excited, but the hotel staff was eager to please and took care of our check-in and had us in our room quickly. We had no issues, and the coffee and "to go" breakfast was appreciated. Completely adequate for our needs.


Room Tip: Higher floors were quieter.

“Avoid this hotel”


Reviewed May 19, 2017




This is a cheap hotel, in the worst sense of the term. It is ill equipped and uncomfortable. There is no room cleaning service, no hairdryer, no coffeemaker, the rooms have a kitchen however no utensils, cups.... you have to request everything from the front desk. We did request a coffee maker however this was an ancient machine that belonged in a garage sale.The bathroom fan was tremendously noisy and long overdue for replacement.While we were there they were changing out the room furniture and the replacements were dusty.The hotel is located right next to (feet away from) a railway line that carries heavy freight trainsThe hotel has a "grab and go" breakfast buffet, which basically comprises a couple of pots of coffee, some granola bars and prepackaged muffinsAll this for $250 per night (inc tax) !!

We sincerely apologize for your disappointing stay. Please know, our housekeeping service is designed for long-term guests, offering minimal intrusion to their home-like stay, but we are happy to offer this service to you at a minimal fee. Our guests often bring their own bath amenities such as hairdryers and toiletries, so that's why these items are available at the front desk. Kitchenware for your suite is also available there. We are sorry if we didn’t communicate this to you during check-in. We value your feedback and will use it to ensure we are more consistent in our service levels. We regret the inconvenience caused and hope you will consider giving us another chance on your next trip to the area.Sincerely,General Manager

“Extend your life and don't stay here!”


Reviewed May 13, 2017




I have over 25 years on the road and this was the worst hotel place I have ever stayed at. The paint was coming off the wall in spots, the room was filthy, and the furniture has seen better days. That is not to mention the train that zipped by my room until 9:45 PM and started again very early in the morning. The hotel is only 100 feet or so from the tracks. The hallways stunk and I mean they were bad. The bed was like a rock and the linens did not look like they were clean. I will never stay at this place again.

“Business as usual”


Reviewed April 17, 2017




I wanted to find a nice place in Santa Clara that was also very affordable, we got more than we expected. This was the nicest Extended Stay that we have stayed thus far. The staff was excellent they made special accommodations and over all worked as if we were staying at a 4 or 5 star hotel

“Hypoallergenic”


Reviewed April 13, 2017




I asked for fabreeze-free and I got fabreeze-free! I hate fabreeze and similar air fresheners because they cause headaches. All hotels should be fabreeze-free out of good sense. ESA does this upon request.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.

Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
