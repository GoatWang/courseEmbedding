PART I 
INFORMATION REQUIRED IN
PROSPECTUS 


PROSPECTUS

May 1, 2005

PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY
VARIABLE CONTRACT
REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT

This prospectus is attached to two
other types of prospectuses. The first describes either a variable annuity contract or a
variable life insurance contract (collectively, the �Contract�) issued by Pruco
Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (�Pruco Life of New Jersey,�
�us,� �we,� or �our�), a stock life insurance company that
is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America
(�Prudential�). The second prospectus describes several investment options
available under that variable contract through The Prudential Series Fund, Inc. (the
�Series Fund�). The Series Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 as an open-end, diversified management investment company. The Series Fund
consists of separate investment portfolios that are mutual funds, each with a different
investment policy and objective. 
This prospectus describes the Pruco
Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account (the �Real Property
Account�), an additional available investment option. Although it is not a mutual
fund, in many ways it is like a mutual fund. Instead of holding a diversified portfolio of
securities, such as stocks or bonds, it consists mainly of a portfolio of commercial and
residential real properties. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey determines
the price of a �share� or, as we call it, a �participating interest�
in this portfolio of properties, just as it does for the other investment options. It is
based upon our best estimate of the fair market value of the properties and other assets
held in this portfolio. The portion of your �Contract Fund� (the total amount
invested under the Contract) that you allocate to this investment option will change daily
in value, up or down, as the fair market value of these real properties and other assets
change. 
The risks of investing in real
property are different from the risks of investing in mutual funds. See RISK
FACTORS. Also, your ability to withdraw or transfer your investment in this option is
not as freely available as it is for the other investment options. See RESTRICTIONS ON
WITHDRAWALS. 
Please read this
prospectus and keep it for future reference. 
The Securities and Exchange
Commission (�SEC�) maintains a Web site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains
material incorporated by reference and other information regarding registrants that file
electronically with the SEC. 
Neither the Securities and
Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of
these securities or determined if this prospectus is accurate or complete. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

SUMMARY 
This Summary provides a brief
overview of the more significant aspects of the Real Property Account. We provide further
detail in the subsequent sections of this prospectus. 
The Real Property Account is a
separate account of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (�Pruco Life of New
Jersey�) created pursuant to New Jersey insurance law. Under that law, the assets of
the Real Property Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other
business of Pruco Life of New Jersey. Owners of certain variable life insurance and
variable annuity contracts issued by Pruco Life of New Jersey may allocate a portion of
their net premiums or purchase payments, or transfer a portion of their Contract Fund, to
the Real Property Account. Values and benefits under the Contracts will thereafter reflect
the investment experience of the Real Property Account. Contract owners, not Pruco Life of
New Jersey, bear the risks and rewards of the investment performance of the Real Property
Account to the extent of the Contract owner�s Contract Fund invested in the Real
Property Account. This prospectus is attached to and should be read in conjunction with
the prospectus for the Contract you selected. 
Investment of The Real
Property Account Assets 
The Real Property Account assets are
invested primarily in income-producing real estate through The Prudential Variable
Contract Real Property Partnership (the �Partnership�), which is a general
partnership that was established by Prudential and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Pruco Life Insurance Company (�Pruco Life�) and Pruco Life Insurance Company of
New Jersey (�Pruco Life of New Jersey�). See The Prudential Variable Contract
Real Property Partnership. Currently Prudential serves as the investment manager of
the Partnership. Prudential acts through Prudential Investment Management, Inc. See The
Investment Manager. The Partnership invests at least 65% of its assets in direct
ownership interests in: 

1.   income-producing real estate;
2.   participating  mortgage loans (mortgages  providing for  participation  in the revenues  generated by, or the appreciation of,
     the underlying property, or both) originated for the Partnership; and
3.   real property sale-leasebacks negotiated  on behalf of the Partnership.

The large majority of these real estate  investments  will be in direct ownership  interests in income  producing real estate,  such as
office  buildings,  shopping  centers,  apartments,  industrial  properties or hotels.  The Partnership may also invest up to 5% of its
assets in direct  ownership  interests in agricultural  land.  Approximately  10% of the  Partnership's  assets will be held in cash or
invested in liquid  instruments  and  securities.  The  remainder  of the  Partnership's  assets may be invested in other types of real
estate related investments, including non-participating mortgage loans and real estate investment trusts.
Investment Objectives

The investment objectives of the Partnership are to:

1.   preserve and protect the Partnership's capital;
2.   compound income by reinvesting  investment cash flow; and
3.   over time,  increase the income amount through  appreciation  in the value of permitted  investments  and, to a lesser extent,
     through mortgage loans and sale-leaseback transactions.

There is no assurance that the
Partnership�s objectives will be attained. See INVESTMENT POLICIES. 
Risk Factors 
Investment in the Real Property
Account, and thereby, participation in the investment experience of the Partnership,
involves significant risks. See RISK FACTORS. These include the risk of fluctuating
real estate values and the risk that the appraised or estimated values of the
Partnership�s real property investments will not be realized upon their disposition.
Many of the Partnership�s real estate investments will not be quickly convertible
into cash. Therefore, the Real Property Account should be viewed as a long-term
investment. See RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey and the
investment manager have taken steps to ensure that the Real Property Account and
Partnership will be sufficiently liquid to satisfy all withdrawal or loan requests
promptly (within seven days), see Liquidity of Investments. Prudential�s
management of the Partnership is subject to certain conflicts of interest, including the
possible acquisition of properties from Prudential Financial affiliates. See CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST. 
Charges 
The Partnership pays a daily
investment management fee, which amounts to 1.25% per year of the average daily gross
assets of the Partnership. The Partnership also compensates the investment manager for
providing certain accounting and administrative services. See CHARGES. The portion
of your Contract Fund allocated to the Real Property Account is subject to the same
Contract charges as the portion of your Contract Fund allocated to The Prudential Series
Fund, Inc. (the �Series Fund�). The Series Fund is the underlying funding
vehicle for the other variable investment options available to Contract owners. You should
read the Contract prospectus for a description of those charges. 
Availability to Pruco
Life of New Jersey Contracts 
The Real Property Account is
currently available to purchasers of Pruco Life of New Jersey�s Variable
Appreciable Life� Insurance Contracts, Variable Life
Insurance Contracts, Discovery� Life Plus Contracts and
Discovery� Plus Contracts. It is not available on Contracts that are
purchased in connection with IRAs, Section 403(b) annuities, and other tax-qualified
plans, that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(�ERISA�) or to the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. See THE REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT�S UNAVAILABILITY TO CERTAIN
CONTRACTS. For example, a Variable Appreciable Life Contract owner who elects
to invest part of his or her net premiums in the Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable
Appreciable Account, a separate account of Pruco Life of New Jersey registered as a unit
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and part in the Real Property
Account, will be subject to the same: (1) monthly sales charges; (2) risk charges; (3)
administrative charges; (4) insurance charges; and (5) contingent deferred sales charges
without regard to what portion is invested in the Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable
Appreciable Account and what portion is invested in the Real Property Account. The Real
Property Account has established different subaccounts, relating to the different types of
variable Contracts that may participate in the Real Property Account. These subaccounts
provide the mechanism and maintain the records whereby these different Contract charges
are made.

GENERAL
INFORMATION ABOUT PRUCO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY, PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY
VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT, THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL
PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP, AND THE INVESTMENT MANAGER 



Pruco Life Insurance
Company of New Jersey 
Pruco Life Insurance Company of New
Jersey (�Pruco Life of New Jersey�) is a stock life insurance company, organized
in 1982 under the laws of the State of New Jersey. It is licensed to sell life insurance
and annuities only in the States of New Jersey and New York. These Contracts are not
offered in any state in which the necessary approvals have not yet been obtained. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey is an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America
(�Prudential�), a New Jersey stock life insurance company that has been doing
business since 1875. Prudential is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential
Financial, Inc. (�Prudential Financial�), a New Jersey insurance holding
company. As Pruco Life of New Jersey�s ultimate parent, Prudential Financial
exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of Pruco Life of
New Jersey and Prudential. However, neither Prudential Financial, Prudential, nor any
other related company has any legal responsibility to pay amounts that Pruco Life of New
Jersey may owe under the contract or policy. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey�s
financial statements appear in the statement of additional information for the Contract
prospectus, which is available upon request. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey
Variable Contract Real Property Account 
The Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable
Contract Real Property Account (the �Real Property Account�), was established on
October 30, 1987 under New Jersey law as a separate investment account. The Real Property
Account meets the definition of a �separate account� under the federal
securities laws. The Real Property Account holds assets that are separated from all of
Pruco Life of New Jersey�s other assets. The Real Property Account is used only to
support the variable benefits payable under the Contracts that are funded by the real
estate investment option. 
The Contract obligations to Contract
owners and beneficiaries are general corporate obligations of Pruco Life of New Jersey.
Pruco Life of New Jersey is also the legal owner of the Real Property Account assets.
Pruco Life of New Jersey will maintain assets in the Real Property Account with a total
market value at least equal to the amounts credited under the real estate option to all
the Contracts participating in the Real Property Account. These assets may not be charged
with liabilities, which arise from any other business that Pruco Life of New Jersey
conducts. In addition to these assets, the Real Property Account�s assets may include
funds contributed by Pruco Life of New Jersey, and reflect any accumulations of the
charges Pruco Life of New Jersey makes against the Real Property Account. See VALUATION
OF CONTRACT OWNER�S PARTICIPATING INTERESTS. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey will bear
the risks and rewards of the Real Property Account�s investment experience to the
extent of its investment in the Real Property Account. Pruco Life of New Jersey may
withdraw or redeem its investment in the Real Property Account at any time. We will not
make any such redemption if it will have a materially adverse impact on the Real Property
Account. Accumulations of charges will be withdrawn on a regular basis. 
Unlike the other separate accounts
funding the Contracts, the Real Property Account is not registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (�SEC�) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an
investment company. For state law purposes, the Real Property Account is treated as a part
or division of Pruco Life of New Jersey. Contract owners have no voting rights with
respect to the Real Property Account. The Real Property Account is under the control and
management of Pruco Life of New Jersey. The Board of Directors and officers of Pruco Life
of New Jersey are responsible for the management of the Real Property Account. No salaries
of Pruco Life of New Jersey personnel are paid by the Real Property Account. Information
regarding the directors and officers of Pruco Life of New Jersey is contained in the
attached prospectus for the Contract. The financial statements of the Real Property
Account begin on page A1. 
The Prudential Variable
Contract Real Property Partnership 
The assets of the Real Property
Account are invested in The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the
�Partnership�). The Partnership, a general partnership organized under New
Jersey law on April 29, 1988, was formed through an agreement among The Prudential
Insurance Company of America, Pruco Life Insurance Company, and Pruco Life Insurance
Company of New Jersey, to provide a means for assets allocated to the real estate
investment option under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts
issued by the respective companies to be invested in a commingled pool. This was done to
provide greater diversification of investments and lower transaction costs than would be
possible if the assets were separately invested by each company. All amounts allocated to
the Real Property Account are contributed by Pruco Life of New Jersey to the Partnership.
Pruco Life of New Jersey�s general partnership interest in the Partnership is held in
the Real Property Account. 
The initial contributions to the
Partnership were made on April 29, 1988. Prudential contributed $100,000 in cash to the
Partnership; Pruco Life of New Jersey contributed $100,000 in cash to the Partnership; and
Pruco Life contributed the real estate and other assets held in its real estate separate
account, which had been actively investing in real estate for more than a year. Those
assets had an estimated market value of $91,538,737 on that date. Each Partner is entitled
to its respective proportionate share of all income, gains, and losses of the Partnership. 
The Partnership assets are valued on
each business day. The value of each Partner�s interest will fluctuate with the
investment performance of the Partnership. In addition, the Partners� interests are
proportionately readjusted, at the current value, on each day when a Partner makes a
contribution to, or withdrawal from, the Partnership. When you choose to allocate a
portion of your net premiums or purchase payments, or transfer a portion of your Contract
Fund, to the Real Property Account, Pruco Life of New Jersey will contribute that amount
to the Partnership as a capital contribution. It will correspondingly increase the Real
Property Account�s interest in the Partnership. Values and benefits under the
Contract will thereafter vary with the performance of the Partnership�s investments.
For more information on how the value of your interest in the Real Property Account and
the value of the Partnership�s investments are calculated, see VALUATION OF
CONTRACT OWNERS� PARTICIPATING INTERESTS. 
Contract owners have no voting rights
with respect to the Partnership operations. The financial statements of the Partnership
begin on page B1. 
The Investment Manager 
Currently, Prudential Investment
Management, Inc. (�PIM�) acts as investment manager of the Partnership. PIM
invests in and manages real estate equities and mortgages for the general account and
separate accounts of Prudential Financial affiliates, and other third party accounts. 
PIM, on behalf of the general
account, and separate accounts of Prudential Financial affiliates, and other third party
accounts, is one of the largest real estate investors in North America. PIM and Prudential
Financial affiliates participate in real estate ventures through public and private
partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, PIM managed $40.9 billion of net domestic real
estate mortgages and equities of which $24.2 billion is in Prudential�s general
account and $16.8 billion is in separate accounts and other third party accounts.
Statement value for general account assets is recorded at depreciated cost and for assets
in separate accounts and other third party accounts at market value. For a discussion of
how the Partnership�s real estate-related investments are valued, see VALUATION OF
CONTRACT OWNERS� PARTICIPATING INTERESTS. 
PIM has organized its real estate
activities into separate business units within Prudential�s Global Asset Management
Group. Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI) is the unit responsible for the investments
of the Real Property Partnership. PREI�s investment staff is responsible for both
general account and third party account real estate investment management activities. 
PREI provides investment management
services on a domestic basis and also acts as part of a global team providing these
services to institutional investors worldwide. PREI is headquartered in Parsippany, New
Jersey and has 4 field offices across the United States. As of December 31, 2004, PREI had
under management approximately 35.4 million net rentable square feet of office real
estate, 17.3 million net rentable square feet of industrial real estate, 14.0 million net
rentable square feet of retail real estate, 2,799 hotel rooms, and 18,060 multifamily
residential units. 
Various divisions of Prudential
Financial may provide PREI with services that may be required in connection with the
Partnership�s investment management agreement. The mortgage operation currently
manages and administers a portfolio of mortgage loans totaling approximately $46.6
billion. 
PIM has entered into an
administrative services agreement with Prudential, Pruco Life Insurance Company, and Pruco
Life Insurance Company of New Jersey under which it pays the companies a fee for
performing certain of PIM�s recordkeeping and other obligations under its investment
management agreement with the Partnership. 
INVESTMENT POLICIES 
Overview 
The Partnership has an investment
policy of investing at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in
income-producing real estate and participating mortgage loans. The largest portion of
these real estate investments are direct ownership interests in income-producing real
estate, such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, apartments, or industrial
properties. Approximately 10% of the Partnership�s assets are generally held in cash
or invested in liquid instruments and securities although the Partners reserve discretion
to increase this amount to meet partnership liquidity requirements. The remainder of the
Partnership�s assets are invested in other types of real estate-related investments,
including real estate investment trusts. 
Investment in Direct
Ownership Interests in Real Estate 
Acquisition.����
  The Partnership�s principal investment policy involves acquiring direct
  ownership interests in existing (including newly constructed) income-producing
  real estate, including office buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings,
  industrial properties, and hotels. The Partnership may also invest up to 5% of
  its assets in direct ownership interests in agricultural land. Property
  acquisitions will generally be carried out by the real estate acquisition
  offices in PREI�s network of field offices located in Parsippany, New
  Jersey, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco, California. A
  field office or an affiliate of Prudential Financial supervises the management
  of properties in all of PIM�s accounts. 
Proposals to acquire properties for
the Partnership are usually originated by a field office. They are reviewed and approved
by the Investment Management Committee of PREI. Depending upon the size of the acquisition
and other factors, a proposed real estate investment may also be submitted for review to
the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors of Prudential. 
Although percentage limitations on
the type and location of properties that may be acquired by the Partnership have not been
established, the Partnership plans to diversify its investments through the type of
property acquired and its geographic location. The Partnership�s investments will be
maintained to meet the Internal Revenue Code diversification requirements. See General
Investment and Operating Policies. 
In order for the Partnership to meet
its stated objectives, it will have to acquire properties that generate more cash than
needed to pay its gross operating expenses. To do this, a substantial portion of the
Partnership�s assets will be invested in properties with operating histories that
include established rent and expense schedules. However, the Partnership may also acquire
recently constructed properties that may be subject to agreements with sellers providing
for certain minimum levels of income. Upon the expiration of or default under these
agreements, there is no assurance that the Partnership will maintain the level of
operating income necessary to produce the return it was previously experiencing. The
Partnership may purchase real property from Prudential Financial or its affiliates under
certain conditions. See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 
The property acquired by the
Partnership is usually real estate, which is ready for use. Accordingly, the Partnership
is not usually subject to the development or construction risks inherent in the purchase
of unimproved real estate. From time to time, however, the Partnership may invest in a
developmental real estate project that is consistent with the Partnership�s
objectives. The Partnership will then be subject to those risks. 
The Partnership will often own the
entire fee interest in an acquired property, but it may also hold other direct ownership
interests. These include, but are not limited to, partnership interests, limited liability
company interests, leaseholds, and tenancies in common. 
Property Management and Leasing
Services. The Partnership usually retains a management company operating in
the area of a property to perform local property management services. A field office or
other affiliate of Prudential Financial will usually: (1) supervise and monitor the
performance of the local management company; (2) determine and establish the required
accounting information to be supplied; (3) periodically inspect the property; (4) review
and approve property operating budgets; and (5) review actual operations to ensure
compliance with budgets. In addition to day-to-day management of the property, the local
management company will have responsibility for: (1) supervision of any on-site personnel;
(2) negotiation of maintenance and service contracts; (3) major repair advice; (4)
replacements and capital improvements; (5) the review of market conditions to recommend
rent schedule changes; and (6) creation of marketing and advertising programs to obtain
and maintain good occupancy rates by responsible tenants. The local management company
fees will reduce the cash flow from the property to the Partnership. 
The Partnership usually retains a
leasing company to perform leasing services on any property with actual or projected
vacancies. The leasing company will coordinate with the property management company to
provide marketing and leasing services for the property. When the property management
company is qualified to handle leasing, it may also be hired to provide leasing services.
Leasing commissions and expenses will reduce the cash flow from the property to the
Partnership. 
PREI may, on behalf of the
Partnership, hire a Prudential Financial affiliate to perform property management or
leasing services. The affiliate�s services must be provided on terms competitive with
unaffiliated entities performing similar services in the same geographic area. See
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 
Annually, the field office which
oversees the management of each property owned by the Partnership will, together with the
local property management firm, develop a business plan and budget for each property. It
will consider, among other things, the projected rollover of individual leases, necessary
capital expenditures and any expansion or modification of the use of the property. The
approval of an officer of PREI is required. The field office will also periodically report
the operating performance of the property to PREI. 
Investments in Mortgage
Loans 
Types of Mortgage Loans 
The Partnership is authorized to
invest in mortgage loans, including conventional mortgage loans that may pay fixed or
variable rates of interest and mortgage loans that have a �participation� (as
defined below). The Partnership will not make mortgage loans to Prudential Financial
affiliates. 
The Partnership intends to give
mortgage loans on: (1) commercial properties (such as office buildings, shopping centers,
hotels, industrial properties, and office showrooms); (2) agricultural properties; and (3)
residential properties (such as garden apartment complexes and high-rise apartment
buildings). These loans are usually secured by properties with income-producing potential
based on historical or projected data. Usually, they are not personal obligations of the
borrower and are not insured or guaranteed. 
1.����
  First Mortgage Loans. The Partnership will primarily make first
  mortgage loans secured by mortgages on existing income-producing property. These
  loans may provide for interest-only payments and a balloon payment at maturity. 
2.����
  Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Partnership also may make
  wraparound mortgage loans on income-producing properties which are already
  mortgaged to unaffiliated entities. A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage
  with a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance of the prior existing
  mortgage plus the amount to be advanced by the lender under the wraparound
  mortgage loan, thereby providing the property owner with additional funds
  without disturbing the existing loan. The terms of wraparound mortgage loans
  made by the Partnership require the borrower to make all principal and interest
  payments on the underlying loan to the Partnership, which will then pay the
  holder of the prior loan. Because the existing first mortgage loan is preserved,
  the lien of the wraparound mortgage loan is junior to it. The Partnership will
  make wraparound mortgage loans only in states where local applicable foreclosure
  laws permit a lender, in the event of the borrower�s default, to obtain
  possession of the property which secures the loan. 
3.����
  Junior Mortgage Loans. The Partnership may also invest in other
  junior mortgage loans. Junior mortgage loans will be secured by mortgages which
  are subordinate to one or more prior liens on the real property. They will
  generally, but not in all cases, provide for repayment in full prior to the end
  of the amortization period of the senior mortgages. Recourse on such loans will
  include the real property encumbered by the Partnership�s mortgage and may
  also include other collateral or personal guarantees by the borrower. 
The Partnership will generally make
junior or wraparound mortgage loans only if the senior mortgage, when combined with the
amount of the Partnership�s mortgage loan, would not exceed the maximum amount which
the Partnership would be willing to commit to a first mortgage loan and only under such
circumstances and on such property as to which the Partnership would otherwise make a
first mortgage loan. 
4.����
  Participations. The Partnership may make mortgage loans, which,
  in addition to charging a base rate of interest, will include provisions
  permitting the Partnership to participate (a �participation�) in the
  economic benefits of the underlying property. The Partnership would receive a
  percentage of: (1) the gross or net revenues from the property operations;
  and/or (2) the increase in the property value realized by the borrower, such as
  through sale or refinancing of the property. These arrangements may also grant
  the Partnership an option to acquire the property or an undivided interest in
  the property securing the loan. When the Partnership negotiates the right to
  receive additional interest in the form of a percentage of the gross revenues or
  otherwise, the fixed cash return to the Partnership from that investment will
  generally be less than would otherwise be the case. It is expected that the
  Partnership will be entitled to percentage participations when the gross or net
  revenues from the property operations exceed a certain base amount. This base
  amount may be adjusted if real estate taxes or similar charges are increased.
  The form and extent of the additional interest that the Partnership receives
  will vary with each transaction depending on: (1) the equity investment of the
  owner or developer of the property; (2) other financing or credit obtained by
  the owner or developer; (3) the fixed base interest rate on the mortgage loan by
  the Partnership; (4) any other security arrangement; (5) the cash flow and pro
  forma cash flow from the property; and (6) market conditions. 
The Partnership intends to use this
additional interest as a hedge against inflation. It assumes that as prices increase in
the economy, the rental prices on properties, such as shopping centers or office
buildings, will increase and there should be a corresponding increase in the property
value. There is no assurance that additional interest or increased property values will be
received. In that event, the Partnership will be entitled to receive only the fixed
portion of its return. 
Standards for Mortgage
Loan Investments 
In making mortgage loans, the
investment manager will consider relevant real property and financial factors, including:
(1) the location, condition, and use of the underlying property; (2) its operating
history; (3) its future income-producing capacity; and (4) the quality, experience, and
creditworthiness of the unaffiliated borrower. 
Before the Partnership makes a
mortgage loan, the investment manager analyzes the fair market value of the underlying
real estate. In general, the amount of each mortgage loan made by the Partnership will not
exceed, when added to the amount of any existing indebtedness, 80% of the estimated or
appraised value of the property mortgaged. 
Dealing With Outstanding
Loans 
The Partnership may sell its mortgage
loans prior to maturity if it is deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent
with the Partnership�s investment objectives. The investment manager may also: (1)
extend the maturity of any mortgage loan made by the Partnership; (2) consent to a sale of
the property subject to a mortgage loan or finance the purchase of a property by making a
new mortgage loan in connection with the sale of a property (either with or without
requiring the repayment of the mortgage loan); (3) renegotiate the terms of a mortgage
loan; and (4) otherwise deal with the mortgage loans of the Partnership. 
Investments in
Sale-Leasebacks 
A portion of the Partnership�s
investments may consist of real property sale-leaseback transactions
(�leasebacks�). In this type of transaction, the Partnership will purchase land
and income-producing improvements on the land and simultaneously lease the land and
improvements, generally to the seller, under a long-term lease. Leasebacks may be for very
long periods and may provide for increasing payments from the lessee. 
Under the terms of the leaseback, the
tenant will operate, or provide for the operation of, the property and generally be
responsible for the payment of all costs, including: (1) taxes; (2) mortgage debt service;
(3) maintenance and repair of the improvements; and (4) insurance. In some cases, the
Partnership may also grant the lessee an option to acquire the land and improvements from
the Partnership after a period of years. The option exercise price would be based on the
fair market value of the property, as encumbered by the lease, the increase in the gross
revenues from the property or other objective criteria reflecting the increased value of
the property. 
In some leaseback transactions, the
Partnership may only purchase the land under an income-producing building and lease the
land to the building owner. In such cases, the Partnership may seek, in addition to base
rents in its leasebacks, participations in the gross revenues from the building in a form
such as a percentage of the gross revenues of the lessee above a base amount (which may be
adjusted if real property taxes increase or for other events). The Partnership may invest
in leasebacks which are subordinate to other interests in the land, buildings, and
improvements, such as a first mortgage, other mortgage, or lien. In those situations, the
Partnership�s leaseback interest will be subject to greater risks. 
The Partnership will only acquire a
property for a leaseback transaction if the purchase price is equal to not more than 100%
of the estimated or appraised property value. The Partnership may dispose of its
leasebacks when deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the
Partnership�s investment objectives. 
General Investment and
Operating Policies 
The Partnership does not intend to
invest in any direct ownership interests in properties, mortgage loans or leasebacks in
order to make short-term profits from their sale, although in exceptional cases, the
investment manager may decide to do so in the best interests of the Partnership. The
Partnership may dispose of its investments whenever necessary to meet its cash
requirements or when it is deemed to be desirable by the investment manager because of
market conditions or otherwise. The Partnership will reinvest any proceeds from the
disposition of assets (and any cash flow from operations) which are not necessary for the
Partnership�s operations and which are not withdrawn by the Partners in order to make
distributions to investors pursuant to the variable contracts issued by the Partners, or
to Prudential to return its equity interests pursuant to this prospectus. The proceeds
will be reinvested in investments consistent with the Partnership�s investment
objectives and policies. 
In making investments in properties,
mortgage loans, leasebacks or other real estate investments, the Partnership will rely on
the investment manager�s analysis of the investment and will not receive an
independent appraisal prior to acquisition. The Partnership expects, however, that all the
properties it owns, and most mortgage loans it holds, will be appraised or valued annually
by an independent appraiser who is a member of a nationally recognized society of
appraisers. Each appraisal will be maintained in the Partnership records for at least five
years. It should be noted that appraised values are opinions and, as such, may not
represent the true worth or realizable value of the property being appraised. 
The Partnership usually purchases
properties on an unleveraged basis. The properties acquired will typically be free and
clear of mortgage debt immediately after their acquisition. The Partnership may, however,
acquire properties subject to existing mortgage loans. In addition, the Partnership may
mortgage or acquire properties partly with the proceeds of purchase money mortgage loans,
up to 80% of the property value. Although this is not usually done, the Partnership may do
so if the investment manager decides that it is consistent with its investment objectives.
When the Partnership mortgages its properties, it bears the expense of mortgage payments.
See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP. 
The Partnership may also invest a
portion of its assets in non-participating mortgage loans, real estate limited
partnerships, limited liability companies, real estate investment trusts, and other
vehicles whose underlying investment is in real estate. 
The Partnership�s investments
will be maintained in order to meet the diversification requirements set forth in
regulations under the Internal Revenue Code (the �Code�) relating to the
investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts. In order to
meet the diversification requirements under the regulations, the Partnership will meet the
following test: (1) no more than 55% of the assets will be invested in any one investment;
(2) no more than 70% of the assets will be invested in any two investments; (3) no more
than 80% of the assets will be invested in any three investments; and (4) no more than 90%
of the assets will be invested in any four investments. All interests in the same real
property project are treated as a single investment. The Partnership must meet the above
test within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. To comply with the
diversification requirements of the State of Arizona, the Partnership will limit
additional investments in any one parcel or related parcels to an amount not exceeding 10%
of Partnership�s gross assets, as of the prior fiscal year end. 
In managing the assets of the
Partnership, the investment manager will use its discretion in determining whether to
foreclose on defaulting borrowers or to evict defaulting tenants. The investment manager
will decide which course of action is in the best interests of the Partnership in
maintaining the value of the investment. 
Property management services are
usually required for the Partnership�s investments in properties which are owned and
operated by the Partnership, but usually will not be needed for mortgage loans owned by
the Partnership, except for mortgage servicing. It is possible, however, that these
services will be necessary or desirable in exercising default remedies under a foreclosure
on a mortgage loan. The investment manager may engage, on behalf of the Partnership,
Prudential Financial affiliated or unaffiliated entities to provide these additional
services to the Partnership. The investment manager may engage Prudential Financial
affiliates to provide property management, property development services, loan servicing
or other services if and only if the fees paid to an affiliate do not exceed the amount
that would be paid to an independent party for similar services rendered in the same
geographic area. See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 
The investment manager will manage
the Partnership so that the Real Property Account will not be subject to registration
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This requires monitoring the proportion of the
Partnership�s assets to be placed in various investments. 
CURRENT REAL
ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS 
The current principal real
estate-related investments held by the Partnership are described below. Many of these
investments were originated by, and previously held in, The Prudential Real Property
Account of Pruco Life Insurance Company (the �Pruco Life Account�), a separate
account established to fund the real estate investment option under variable contracts
issued by Pruco Life. Prior to the formation of the Partnership, the Pruco Life Account
followed the same investment policies as those followed by the Partnership. Pruco Life
contributed the assets held in the Pruco Life Account to the Partnership as its initial
capital contribution to the Partnership. 
Properties 
The Partnership owns the following
properties as of December 31, 2004. 
1. Office Properties 


�

The
Partnership owns office properties in Lisle and Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois; Brentwood,

units available of which 91% or 1,135 units are leased. Leases range from month to month
to one year. Two of the Partnership�s Salem, Oregon apartment complexes, which had a
total of 188 units, were sold on December 14, 2004. 



3. Retail Property 


�

The
Partnership owns retail centers in Roswell, Georgia; Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri;
Ocean City, Maryland; and Hampton, Virginia. Total square footage owned is approximately
1,163,464 of which 84% or 979,251 square feet are leased between 1 and 30 years. 



4. Industrial Properties 


�

December 10, 2003, the Partnership invested in a hotel located in Lake Oswego, Oregon.
This joint venture investment has 161 rooms. Occupancy for the year ended 2004 averaged
68.3%. 



RISK FACTORS 
There are certain risk factors that
you should consider before allocating a portion of your net premiums or purchase payments,
or transferring a portion of your Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account. These
include valuation risks, (see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS� PARTICIPATING
INTERESTS), certain conflicts of interest, (see CONFLICTS OF INTEREST), as well
as the following risks: 
Liquidity of Investments 
Because the Real Property Account
will, through the Partnership, invest primarily in real estate, its assets will not be as
liquid as the investments generally made by separate accounts of life insurance companies
funding variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. The Partnership will,
however, hold approximately 10% of its assets in cash and invested in liquid securities.
The primary purposes for such investments are to meet the expenses involved in the
operation of the Partnership and to allow it to have sufficient liquid assets to meet any
requests for withdrawals from the Real Property Account. Such withdrawals would be made in
order to meet requested or required payments under the Contracts. The Partnership may also
borrow funds to meet liquidity needs. See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP. 
We have taken steps to ensure that
the Partnership will be liquid enough to meet all anticipated withdrawals by the Partners
to meet the separate accounts� liquidity requirements. It is possible that the
Partnership may need to dispose of a real property or mortgage loan investment promptly in
order to meet such withdrawal requests. 
General Risks of Real
Property Investments 
By participating in the Real Property
Account and thereby in the investment performance of the Partnership, you will be subject
to many of the risks of real property investments. These include: 
1.����
  Risks of Ownership of Real Properties. The Partnership will be
  subject to the risks inherent in the ownership of real property such as
  fluctuations in occupancy rates and operating expenses and variations in rental
  schedules. It may be adversely affected by general and local economic
  conditions, the supply of and demand for properties of the type in which the
  Partnership invests, zoning laws, and real property tax rates. Operation of
  property in which the Partnership invests will primarily involve rental of that
  property to tenants. The financial failure of a tenant resulting in the
  termination of their lease might cause a reduction in the cash flow to the
  Partnership. If a lease is terminated, there is no assurance that the
  Partnership will be able to find a new tenant for the property on terms as
  favorable to the Partnership as those from the prior tenant. Investments in
  hotels are subject to additional risk from the daily turnover and fluctuating
  occupancy rates of hotel rooms and the absence of long-term tenants. 
The Partnership�s properties
will also be subject to the risk of loss due to certain types of property damage (such as
from nuclear power plant accidents and wars), which are either uninsurable or not
economically insurable. 
2.����
  Risks of Mortgage Loan Investments. The Partnership�s
  mortgage loan investments will be subject to the risk of default by the
  borrowers. In this event the Partnership would have the added responsibility of
  foreclosing on or pursuing other remedies on the underlying properties to
  protect the value of its mortgage loans. A borrower�s ability to meet its
  mortgage loan payments will be dependent upon the risks generally inherent to
  the ownership of real property. Mortgage loans made by the Partnership will
  generally not be personal obligations of the borrowers. The Partnership will
  only rely on the value of the underlying property for its security.
  Mechanics�, materialmen�s, government, and other liens may have or
  obtain priority over the Partnership�s security interest in the property. 
In addition, the Partnership�s
mortgage loan investments will be subject to prepayment risks. If the terms of the
mortgage loans permit, mortgagors may prepay the loans, thus possibly changing the
Partnership�s return. 
Junior mortgage loans (including
wraparound mortgage loans) will be subject to greater risk than first mortgage loans,
since they will be subordinate to liens of senior mortgagees. In the event a default
occurs on a senior mortgage, the Partnership may be required to make payments or take
other actions to cure the default (if it has the right to do so) in order to prevent
foreclosure on the senior mortgage and possible loss of all or portions of the
Partnership�s investment. �Due on sale� clauses included in some senior
mortgages, accelerating the amount due under the senior mortgage in the case of sale of
the property, may be applied to the sale of the property upon foreclosure by the
Partnership of its junior mortgage loan. 
The risk of lending on real estate
increases as the proportion, which the amount of the mortgage loan bears to the fair
market value of the real estate increases. The Partnership usually does not make mortgage
loans of over 80% of the estimated or appraised value of the property that secures the
loan. There can be no assurance, that in the event of a default, the Partnership will
realize an amount equal to the estimated or appraised value of the property on which a
mortgage loan was made. 
Mortgage loans made by the
Partnership may be subject to state usury laws. These laws impose limits on interest
charges and possible penalties for violation of those limits, including restitution of
excess interest, unenforceability of debt, and treble damages. The Partnership does not
intend to make mortgage loans at usurious rates of interest. Uncertainties in determining
the legality of interest rates and other borrowing charges under some statutes could
result in inadvertent violations, in which case the Partnership could incur the penalties
mentioned above. 
3.����
  Risks with Participations. The Partnership may seek to invest in
  mortgage loans and leasebacks with participations, which will provide the
  Partnership with both fixed interest and additional interest based upon gross
  revenues, sale proceeds, and/or other variable amounts. If the interest income
  received by the Partnership is based, in part, on a percentage of the gross
  revenues or sale proceeds of the underlying property, the Partnership�s
  income will depend on the success in the leasing of the underlying property, the
  management and operation of such property by the borrower or lessee and upon the
  market value of the property upon ultimate disposition. If the Partnership
  negotiates a mortgage loan with a lower fixed interest rate and an additional
  percentage of the gross revenues or eventual sale proceeds of the underlying
  property, and the underlying property fails to generate increased revenues or to
  appreciate, the Partnership will have foregone a potentially greater fixed
  return without receiving the benefit of appreciation. State laws may limit
  participations. In the event of the borrower�s bankruptcy, it is possible
  that as a result of the Partnership�s interest in the gross revenues or
  sale proceeds, a court could treat the Partnership as a partner or joint
  venturer with the borrower, and the Partnership could lose the priority its
  security interest would have been given, or be liable for the borrower�s
  debts. The Partnership will structure its participations to avoid being
  characterized as a partner or joint venturer with the borrower. 
4.����
  Risks with Sale-Leaseback Transactions. Leaseback transactions
  typically involve the acquisition of land and improvements thereon and the
  leaseback of such land and improvements to the seller or another party. The
  value of the land and improvements will depend, in large part, on the
  performance and financial stability of the lessee and its tenants, if any. The
  tenants� leases may have shorter terms than the leaseback. Therefore, the
  lessee�s future ability to meet payment obligations to the Partnership will
  depend on its ability to obtain renewals of such leases or new leases upon
  satisfactory terms and the ability of the tenants to meet their rental payments
  to the lessee. 
PREI investigates the stability and
creditworthiness of lessees in all commercial properties it may acquire, including
leaseback transactions. However, a lessee in a leaseback transaction may have few, if any,
assets. The Partnership will therefore rely for its security on the value of the land and
improvements. When the Partnership�s leaseback interest is subordinate to other
interests in the land or improvements, such as a first mortgage or other lien, the
Partnership�s leaseback will be subject to greater risk. A default by a lessee or
other premature termination of the leaseback may result in the Partnership being unable to
recover its investment unless the property is sold or leased on favorable terms. The
ability of the lessee to meet its obligations under the leaseback, and the value of a
property, may be affected by a number of factors inherent in the ownership of real
property which are described above. Furthermore, the long-term nature of a leaseback may,
in the future, result in the Partnership receiving lower average annual rentals. However,
this risk may be lessened if the Partnership obtains participations in connection with its
leasebacks. 
Reliance on The Partners
and The Investment Manager 
You do not have a vote in determining
the policies of the Partnership or the Real Property Account. You also have no right or
power to take part in the management of the Partnership or the Real Property Account. The
investment manager alone, subject to the supervision of the Partners, will make all
decisions with respect to the management of the Partnership, including the determination
as to what properties to acquire, subject to the investment policies and restrictions.
Although the Partners have the right to replace the investment manager, it should be noted
that Prudential, Pruco Life, Pruco Life of New Jersey, and the investment manager are
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. 
The Partnership will compete in the
acquisition of its investments with many other individuals and entities engaged in real
estate activities, including the investment manager and its affiliates. See CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST. There may be intense competition in obtaining properties or mortgages in
which the Partnership intends to invest. Competition may result in increased costs of
suitable investments. 
Since the Partnership will
continuously look for new investments, you will not be able to evaluate the economic merit
of many of the investments, which may be acquired by the Partnership. You must depend upon
the ability of the investment manager to select investments. 
INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 
The Partnership has adopted certain
restrictions relating to its investment activities. These restrictions may be changed, if
the law permits, by the Partners. Pursuant to these restrictions, the Partnership will
not: 

1.       Make any investments not related to real estate, other than liquid instruments and securities.

2.       Engage in underwriting of securities issued by others.

3.       Invest in securities issued by any investment company.

4.       Sell securities short.

5.       Purchase or sell oil, gas, or other mineral exploration or development programs.

6.       Make loans to the Partners, any of their affiliates, or any investment program sponsored by such parties.

7.       Enter into leaseback transactions in which the lessee is Prudential, Pruco Life, Pruco Life of New Jersey, their
         affiliates, or any investment program sponsored by such parties.

8.       Borrow more than 331/3%  (pursuant to California  state  requirements)  of the value of the assets of the  Partnership  (based
         upon periodic valuations and appraisals).  See VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS.

DIVERSIFICATION
REQUIREMENTS 
The Partnership�s investments
are maintained so as to meet the diversification requirements set forth in Treasury
Regulations issued pursuant to Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the
investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts. Section
817(h) requires, among other things, that the partnership will have no more than 55% of
the assets invested in any one investment, no more than 70% of the assets will be invested
in any two investments, no more than 80% of the assets will be invested in any three
investments, and no more than 90% of the assets will be invested in any four investments.
To comply with requirements of the State of Arizona, the Partnership will limit additional
investments in any one parcel or related parcels to an amount not exceeding 10% of the
Partnership�s gross assets as of the prior fiscal year. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
The investment manager, will be
subject to various conflicts of interest in managing the Partnership. PIM invests in real
estate equities and mortgages for the general account of Prudential Financial affiliates
and for third parties, including through separate accounts established for the benefit of
qualified pension and profit-sharing plans. PIM also manages, or advises in the management
of, real estate equities and mortgages owned by other persons. In addition, affiliates of
Prudential Financial are general partners in publicly offered limited partnerships that
invest in real estate equities and mortgage loans. Prudential Financial and its affiliates
may engage in business activities, which will be competitive with the Partnership.
Moreover, the Partnership may purchase properties from Prudential Financial or its
affiliates. 
The conflicts involved in managing
the Partnership include: 
1.����
  Lack of Independent Negotiations between the Partnership and The Investment
  Manager. All agreements and arrangements relating to compensation
  between the Partnership and the investment manager, PIM or any affiliate of
  Prudential Financial will not be the result of arm�s-length negotiations. 
2.����
  Competition by the Partnership with Prudential Financial�s Affiliates for
  Acquisition and Disposition of Investments. Prudential Financial
  affiliates are involved in numerous real estate investment activities for their
  general account, their separate accounts, and other entities. They may involve
  investment policies comparable to the Partnership�s and may compete with
  the Partnership for the acquisition and disposition of investments. Moreover,
  additional accounts or affiliated entities may be formed in the future with
  investment objectives similar to those of the Partnership. In short, existing or
  future real estate investment accounts or entities managed or advised by
  Prudential Financial affiliates may have the same management as the Partnership
  and may be in competition with the Partnership regarding real property
  investments, mortgage loan investments, leasebacks, and the management and sale
  of such investments. Prudential Financial affiliates are not obligated to
  present to the Partnership any particular investment opportunity, regardless of
  whether the opportunity would be suitable for investment by the Partnership. 
Prudential Financial affiliates have,
however, adopted procedures to distinguish between equity investments available for the
Partnership as opposed to the other programs and entities described above. If investment
accounts or entities managed by Prudential Financial affiliates have investment objectives
and policies similar to the Partnership and are in the market to acquire properties or
make investments at the same time as the Partnership, the following procedures will be
followed to resolve any conflict of interest. The Investment Allocation Procedure
(�IAP�) has been established to provide a reasonable and fair procedure for
allocating real estate investments among the several accounts managed by Prudential Real
Estate Investors (�PREI�). The IAP is administered by an Allocation Committee
composed of the Managing Directors, Portfolio Management. Allocation decisions are made by
vote of the Allocation Committee, and are approved by the Chief Executive Officer of PREI
(�CEO�). Sufficient information on each investment opportunity is distributed to
all portfolio managers, who each indicate to the Allocation Committee their account�s
interest in the opportunity. Based on such expressions of interest, the Allocation
Committee allocates the investment opportunity to an account (and may also determine a
back-up account or accounts to receive the allocation in the event the account, which is
first allocated the opportunity, fails to pursue the investment for any reason) after
giving appropriate consideration to the following factors and with the goal of providing
each account a fair allotment of investment opportunities: (1) the investment
opportunity�s conformity with an account�s investment criteria and objectives
(including property type, size and location, diversification, anticipated returns,
investment structure, etc.); (2) the amount of funds available for investment (in total
and by property type) by an account; (3) the length of time such funds (in total and by
property type) have been available for investment; (4) any limitations or restrictions
upon the availability of funds for investment; (5) the absolute and relative (to amount of
funds available) amount of funds invested and committed for the account; (6) whether funds
available for investment are discretionary or non-discretionary, particularly in relation
to the timing of the investment opportunity; (7) an account�s prior dealings or
investments with the seller, developer, lender or other counterparty; and (8) other
factors which the Allocation Committee feel should be considered in fairness to all
accounts participating in the IAP. 
If an account which has been
allocated an investment opportunity does not proceed with the acquisition, and either (i)
no back-up account has been determined by the Allocation Committee, or (ii) all accounts
which were deemed back-up accounts do not proceed with the acquisition, the opportunity
may be reallocated to another account by the Allocation Committee. If an investment
opportunity is appropriate for more than one account, the Allocation Committee may
(subject to the CEO�s approval) permit the sharing of the investment among accounts
which permit such sharing. Such division of the investment opportunity may be accomplished
by separating properties (in a multi-property investment), by co-investment, or otherwise. 
3.����
  Competition with the Partnership from Affiliates for the Time and Services of
  Common Officers, Directors, and Management Personnel. As noted
  above, PIM and Prudential Financial affiliates are involved in numerous real
  estate investment activities. Accordingly, many of the personnel of PIM and
  Prudential Financial affiliates who will be involved in performing services for
  the Partnership have competing demands on their time. Conflicts of interest may
  arise with respect to allocating time among such entities and the Partnership.
  The directors and officers of Prudential Financial and affiliates will determine
  how much time will be devoted to the Partnership affairs. Prudential Financial
  believes it has sufficient personnel to meet its responsibilities to all
  entities to which it is affiliated. 
4.����
  Competitive Properties. Some properties of affiliates may be
  competitive with Partnership properties. Among other things, the properties
  could be in competition with the Partnership�s properties for prospective
  tenants. 
5.����
  Lessee Position. It is possible that Prudential Financial or its
  affiliates may be a lessee in one or more of the properties owned by the
  Partnership. The terms of such a lease will be competitive with leases with
  non-affiliated third parties. The Partnership limits the amount of space that an
  affiliate of Prudential may rent in a property owned by the Partnership. 
6.����
  Use of Affiliates to Perform Additional Services for the
  Partnership. The Partnership may engage Prudential Financial
  affiliates to provide additional services to the Partnership, such as real
  estate brokerage, mortgage servicing, property management, leasing, property
  development, and other real estate-related services. The Partnership may utilize
  the services of such affiliates and pay their fees, as long as the fees paid to
  an affiliate do not exceed the amount that would be paid to an independent party
  for similar services rendered in the same geographic area. 
7.����
  Joint Ventures with Affiliates. The Partnership may enter into
  investments through joint ventures with Prudential Financial, its affiliates, or
  investment programs they sponsor. The Partnership may enter into such a joint
  venture investment with an affiliate only if the following conditions are met:
  (1) the affiliate must have investment objectives substantially identical to
  those of the Partnership; (2) there must be no duplicative property management
  fee, mortgage servicing fee or other fees; (3) the compensation payable to the
  sponsor of the affiliate must be no greater than that payable to the
  Partnership�s investment manager; (4) the Partnership must have a right of
  first refusal to buy if such affiliate wishes to sell the property held in the
  joint venture; and (5) the investment of the Partnership and the affiliate in
  the joint venture must be made on the same terms and conditions (although not
  the same percentage). In connection with such an investment, both affiliated
  parties would be required to approve any decision concerning the investment.
  Thus, an impasse may result in the event the affiliated joint venture partners
  disagree. However, in the event of a disagreement regarding a proposed sale or
  other disposition of the investment, the party not desiring to sell would have a
  right of first refusal to purchase the affiliated joint venture partner�s
  interest in the investment. If this happens, it is possible that in the future
  the joint venture partners would no longer be affiliated. In the event of a
  proposed sale initiated by the joint venture partner, the Partnership would also
  have a right of first refusal to purchase the joint venture partner�s
  interest in the investment. The exercise of a right of first refusal would be
  subject to the Partnership�s having the financial resources to effectuate
  such a purchase. 
If the Partnership invests in joint
venture partnerships which own properties, instead of investing directly in the properties
themselves, they may be subject to risks not otherwise present. These risks include risks
associated with the possible bankruptcy of the Partnership�s co-venturer or such
co-venturer at any time having economic or business interests or goals which are
inconsistent with those of the Partnership. 
8.����
  Purchase of Real Property From Prudential Financial or
  Affiliates. The Partnership may acquire properties owned by
  Prudential Financial or its affiliates, subject to compliance with special
  conditions designed to minimize the conflicts of interests. The Partnership may
  purchase property satisfying the Partnership�s investment objectives and
  policies from an affiliate only if: (1) the applicable insurance regulators
  approve the Partnership�s acquisition of real property from Prudential
  Financial or affiliates to the extent such approval is required under applicable
  insurance regulations; (2) the Partnership acquires the property at a price not
  greater than the appraised value, with the appraisal being conducted by a
  qualified, unaffiliated appraiser; (3) a qualified and independent real estate
  adviser (other than the appraiser) reviews the proposed acquisition and provides
  a letter of opinion that the transaction is fair to the Partnership; and (4) the
  affiliate has owned the property at least two years, the cost paid by the
  affiliate is established, and any increase in the proposed purchase price over
  the cost to the affiliate is, in the opinion of the independent real estate
  adviser, explicable by material factors (including the passage of time) that
  have increased the value of the property. 
THE REAL PROPERTY
ACCOUNT�S UNAVAILABILITY TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS 
Pruco Life of New Jersey has
determined that it is in the best interest of Contract owners participating in the Real
Property Account to provide the Real Property Account with the flexibility to engage in
transactions that may be prohibited if the Real Property Account accepts funds under
Contracts subject to ERISA or the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, owners of Pruco Life of New Jersey Contracts that are
purchased in connection with: (1) IRAs; (2) tax deferred annuities subject to Section
403(b) of the Code; (3) other employee benefit plans which are subject to ERISA; or (4)
prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Code, may not select the Real Property
Account as one of the investment options under their Contract. By not offering the Real
Property Account as an investment option under such contracts, Pruco Life of New Jersey is
able to comply with state insurance law requirements that policy loans be made available
to Contract owners. 
VALUATION OF CONTRACT
OWNERS� PARTICIPATING INTERESTS 
A Contract owner�s interest in
the Real Property Account will initially be the amount they allocated to the Real Property
Account. Thereafter, that value will change daily. The value of a Contract owner�s
interest in the Real Property Account at the close of any day is equal to its amount at
the close of the preceding day, multiplied by the �net investment factor� for
that day arising from the Real Property Account�s participation in the Partnership,
plus any additional amounts allocated to the Real Property Account by the Contract owner,
and reduced by any withdrawals by the Contract owner from the Real Property Account and by
the applicable Contract charges recorded in that Contract�s subaccount. Some of the
charges will be made: (1) daily; (2) on the Contract�s monthly anniversary date; (3)
at the end of each Contract year; and (4) upon withdrawal or annuitization. Periodically
Pruco Life of New Jersey will withdraw from the Real Property Account an amount equal to
the aggregate charges recorded in the subaccounts. 
The �net investment factor�
is calculated on each business day by dividing the value of the net assets of the
Partnership at the end of that day (ignoring, for this purpose, changes resulting from new
contributions to or withdrawals from the Partnership) by the value of the net assets of
the Partnership at the end of the preceding business day. The value of the net assets of
the Partnership at the end of any business day is equal to the sum of all cash held by the
Partnership plus the aggregate value of the Partnership�s liquid securities and
instruments, the individual real properties and the other real estate-related investments
owned by the Partnership, determined in the manner described below, and an estimate of the
accrued net operating income earned by the Partnership from properties and other real
estate-related investments, reduced by the liabilities of the Partnership, including the
daily investment management fee and certain other expenses attributable to the operation
of the Partnership. See CHARGES. 
The Partnership may invest in various
liquid securities and instruments. These investments will generally be carried at their
market value as determine by a valuation method, which the Partners deem appropriate for
the particular type of liquid security or instrument. 
The value of the individual real
properties and other real estate-related investments, including mortgages, acquired by the
Partnership will be determined as follows. Each property or other real estate-related
investment acquired by the Partnership will initially be valued at its purchase price. In
acquiring a property or other real estate-related investment, PIM will not obtain an
independent appraisal but will instead rely on its own analysis of the investment�s
fair market value. Thereafter, all properties and most real estate-related investments
will ordinarily be appraised by an independent appraiser at least annually. At least every
three months, PIM will review each property or other real estate-related investments and
adjust its valuation if it concludes there has been a change in the value of the property
or other real estate-related investment since the last valuation. The revised value will
remain in effect and will be used in each day�s calculation of the value of the
Partnership�s assets until the next review or appraisal. It should be noted that
appraisals are only estimates and do not necessarily reflect the realizable value of an
investment. 
The estimated amount of the net
operating income of the Partnership from properties and other real estate-related
investments will be based on estimates of revenues and expenses for each property and
other real estate-related investments. Annually, PIM will prepare a month-by-month
estimate of the revenues and expenses (�estimated net operating income�) for
each property and other real estate-related investments owned by the Partnership. Each day
PIM will add to the value of the assets, as determined above, a proportionate part of the
estimated net operating income for the month. In effect, PIM will establish a daily
accrued receivable of the estimated net operating income from each property and other real
estate-related investments owned by the Partnership (the �daily accrued
receivable�). On a monthly basis, the Partnership will receive a report of actual
operating results for each property and other real estate-related investments
(�actual net operating income�). Such actual net operating income will be
recognized on the books of the Partnership and the amount of the then-outstanding daily
accrued receivable will be correspondingly adjusted. In addition, as cash from a property
or other real estate-related investment is actually received by the Partnership,
receivables and other accounts will be appropriately adjusted. Periodically, but at least
every three months, PIM will review its prospective estimates of net operating income in
light of actual experience and make an adjustment to such estimates if circumstances
indicate that such an adjustment is warranted. PIM follows this practice of accruing
estimated net operating income from properties and other real estate-related investments
because net operating income from such investments is generally received on an
intermittent rather than daily basis, and the Partners believe it is more equitable to
participating Contract owners if such net operating income is estimated and a
proportionate amount is recognized daily. Because the daily accrual of estimated net
operating income is based on estimates that may not turn out to reflect actual revenue and
expenses, Contract owners will bear the risk that this practice will result in the
undervaluing or overvaluing of the Partnership�s assets. 
PIM may adjust the value of any asset
held by the Partnership based on events that have increased or decreased the realizable
value of a property or other real estate-related investment. For example, adjustments may
be made for events indicating an impairment of a borrower�s or a lessee�s
ability to pay any amounts due or events which affect the property values of the
surrounding area. There can be no assurance that the factors for which an adjustment may
be made will immediately come to the attention of PIM. Additionally, because the
evaluation of such factors may be subjective, there can be no assurance that such
adjustments will be timely made in all cases where the value of the Partnership�s
investments may be affected. All adjustments made to the valuation of the
Partnership�s investments, including adjustments to estimated net operating income,
the daily accrued receivable, and adjustments to the valuation of properties and other
real estate-related investments, will be on a prospective basis only. 
The above method of valuation of the
Partnership�s assets may be changed, without the consent of Contract owners, should
the Partners determine that another method would more accurately reflect the value of the
Partnership�s investments. Changes in the method of valuation could result in a
change in the Contract Fund values which may have either an adverse or beneficial effect
on Contract owners. Information concerning any material change in the valuation method
will be given to all Contract owners in the annual report of the operations of the Real
Property Account. 
Although the above-described
valuation methods have been adopted because the Partners believe they will provide a
reasonable way to determine the fair market value of the Partnership�s investments,
there may well be variations between the amount realizable upon disposition and the
Partnership�s valuation of such assets. Contract owners may be either favorably or
adversely affected if the valuation method results in either overvaluing or undervaluing
the Partnership�s investments. If a Contract owner invests in the Real Property
Account at a time in which the Partnership�s investments are overvalued, the Contract
owner will be credited with less of an interest than if the value had been correctly
stated. A Contract owner withdrawing from the Real Property Account during such time will
receive more than he or she would if the value had been correctly stated, to the detriment
of other Contract owners. The converse situation will exist if the Partnership�s
assets are undervalued. 
BORROWING BY THE
PARTNERSHIP 
The Partnership may borrow for
Partnership purposes, including to meet its liquidity requirements and the leveraging of
currently-owned property to buy new property, subject to a maximum debt to value ratio of
331/3% (pursuant to California state requirements) based on the aggregate value of all
Partnership assets. The Partnership will bear the cost of all such borrowings. The Real
Property Account, and Contract owners participating in it, will bear a portion of any
borrowing costs equal to their percentage interest in the Partnership. Moreover, although
the Partnership will generally make unleveraged investments, it reserves the right to
borrow up to 80% of the value of a property (with the value of a property determined as
explained under VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS� PARTICIPATING INTERESTS).
Increasing the Partnership�s assets through leveraged investments would increase the
compensation paid to PIM since its investment management fee is a percentage of the
Partnership�s gross assets. Any borrowing by the Partnership would increase the
Partnership�s risk of loss. It could also inhibit the Partnership from achieving its
investment objectives because the Partnership�s payments on any loans would have to
be made regardless of the profitability of its investments. 
CHARGES 
Pursuant to the investment management
agreement, the Partnership pays a daily investment management fee which is equal to an
effective annual rate of 1.25% of the average daily gross assets of the Partnership.
Certain other expenses and charges attributable to the operation of the Partnership are
also charged against the Partnership. In acquiring an investment, the Partnership may
incur various types of expenses paid to third parties, including but not limited to,
brokerage fees, attorneys� fees, architects� fees, engineers� fees, and
accounting fees. After acquisition of an investment, the Partnership will incur recurring
expenses for the preparation of annual reports, periodic appraisal costs, mortgage
servicing fees, annual audit charges, accounting and legal fees, and various
administrative expenses. These expenses will be charged against the Partnership�s
assets. Some of these operating expenses represent reimbursement of the manager for the
cost of providing certain services necessary to the operation of the Partnership, such as
daily accounting services, preparation of annual reports, and various administrative
services. The investment manager charges the Partnership mortgage loan servicing fees
pursuant to the standards outlined in item 6 under CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. In
addition to the various expenses charged against the Partnership�s assets, other
expenses such as insurance costs, taxes, and property management fees will ordinarily be
deducted from rental income, thereby reducing the gross income of the Partnership. 
As explained earlier, charges to the
Contracts will be recorded in the corresponding subaccounts of the Real Property Account.
From time to time, Pruco Life of New Jersey will withdraw from the Real Property Account
an amount equal to the aggregate amount of these charges. Aside from the charges to the
Contracts, Pruco Life of New Jersey does not charge the Real Property Account for the
expenses involved in the Real Property Account�s operation. The Real Property Account
will, however, bear its proportionate share of the charges made to the Partnership as
described above. 
The Partnership is not a taxable
entity under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The income, gains, and losses of
the Partnership are attributed, for federal income tax purposes, to the Partners in the
Partnership. The earnings of the Real Property Account are, in turn, taxed as part of the
operations of Pruco Life of New Jersey. Pruco Life of New Jersey is currently not charging
the Real Property Account for company federal income taxes. Pruco Life of New Jersey may
make such a charge in the future. 
Under current laws Pruco Life of New
Jersey may incur state and local taxes (in addition to premium taxes) in several states.
At present, Pruco Life of New Jersey does not charge these taxes against the Contracts or
the Real Property Account, but Pruco Life of New Jersey may decide to charge the Real
Property Account for such taxes in the future. 
RESTRICTIONS ON
WITHDRAWALS 
Before allocating any portion of your
net premium or purchase payments, or transferring any portion of your Contract Fund, to
the Real Property Account, you should be aware that withdrawals from the Real Property
Account may have greater restrictions than the other variable investment options available
under the Contracts. Pruco Life of New Jersey reserves the right to restrict transfers
into or out of the Real Property Account. Apart from the limitations on transfers out of
the Real Property Account described below, Pruco Life of New Jersey will only restrict
transfers out of the Real Property Account if there is insufficient cash available to meet
Contract owners� requests and prompt disposition of the Partnership�s
investments to meet such requests could not be made on commercially reasonable terms. 
Pruco Life of New Jersey will pay any
death benefit, cash surrender value, withdrawal or loan proceeds within seven days after
receipt at a Pruco Life of New Jersey Service Office of all the documents required for
such a payment. Other than the death benefit, which is determined as of the date of death
for life insurance products, the amount will be determined as of the date of receipt of
the request. 
The funds necessary to pay any death
benefit, cash surrender value, withdrawal or loan proceeds funded by the Real Property
Account will normally be obtained, first, from any cash flows into the Real Property
Account on the day the funds are required. If, on the day the funds are required, cash
flows into the Real Property Account are less than the amount of funds required, Pruco
Life of New Jersey will seek to obtain such funds by withdrawing a portion of its interest
in the Partnership. The Partnership will normally obtain funds to meet such a withdrawal
request from its net operating income and from the liquid securities and instruments it
holds. If the Partners determine that these sources are insufficient to meet anticipated
withdrawals from the Partnership, the Partnership may use a line of credit or otherwise
borrow up to 331/3% (pursuant to California state requirements) of the value of the
Partnership�s assets. See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP. If the Partners
determine that such a borrowing by the Partnership would not serve the best interests of
Contract owners, Pruco Life of New Jersey may, in the event of a Contract loan or
withdrawal, rather than take the amount of any loan or withdrawal request proportionately
from all investment options under the Contract (including the Real Property Account), take
any such loan or withdrawal first from the other investment options under the Contract. 
Transfers from the Real Property
Account to the other investment options available under the Contract are currently
permitted only during the 30-day period beginning on the Contract anniversary. The maximum
amount that may be transferred out of the Real Property Account each year is the greater
of: (a) 50% of the amount invested in the Real Property Account or (b) $10,000. Such
transfer requests received prior to the Contract anniversary will be effected on the
Contract anniversary. Transfer requests received within the 30-day period beginning on the
Contract anniversary will be effected as of the end of the valuation period in which a
proper written request or authorized telephone request is received. The �valuation
period� means the period of time from one determination of the value of the amount
invested in the Real Property Account to the next. Such determinations are made when the
value of the assets and liabilities of the Partnership is calculated, which is generally
at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on each day during which the New York Stock Exchange is open.
Transfers into or out of the Real Property Account are also subject to the general limits
under the Contracts. 
RESTRICTIONS ON
CONTRACT OWNERS� INVESTMENT IN THE REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT 
As explained earlier, identification
and acquisition of real estate investments meeting the Partnership�s investment
objectives is a time-consuming process. Because the Real Property Account and the
Partnership are managed so they will not become investment companies subject to the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the portion of the Partnership�s assets that may be
invested in securities, as opposed to non-securities real estate investments, is strictly
limited. For these reasons, Pruco Life of New Jersey reserves the right to restrict or
limit Contract owners� allocation of funds to the Real Property Account. Any such
restrictions are likely to take the form of restricting the timing, amount and/or
frequency of transfers into the Real Property Account and/or precluding Contract owners
who have not previously selected the Real Property Account from allocating a portion of
their net premiums or purchase payments to the Real Property Account. 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSIDERATIONS 
The federal income tax treatment of
Contract benefits is described briefly in the attached prospectus for the particular
Contract you selected. Pruco Life of New Jersey believes that the same principles will
apply with respect to Contracts funded in whole or part by the Real Property Account. The
Partnership�s conformity with the diversification standards for the investments of
variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts is essential to ensure that
treatment. See GENERAL INVESTMENT AND OPERATING Policies. Pruco Life of New Jersey
urges you to consult a qualified tax adviser. 
Under the Internal Revenue Code, the
Partnership is not a taxable entity and any income, gains or losses of the Partnership are
passed through to the Partners, including Pruco Life of New Jersey, with respect to the
Real Property Account. The Real Property Account is not a separate taxpayer for purposes
of the Internal Revenue Code. The earnings of the Real Property Account are taxed as part
of the operations of Pruco Life of New Jersey. No charge is currently being made to the
Real Property Account for company federal income taxes. We may make such a charge in the
future, see CHARGES.

MANAGEMENT�S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
All of the assets of the Real
Property Account (the �Account�) are invested in the Prudential Variable
Contract Real Property Partnership (the �Partnership�). Correspondingly, the
liquidity, capital resources and results of operations for the Real Property Account are
contingent upon the Partnership. Therefore, all of management�s discussion of these
items is at the Partnership level. The partners in the Partnership are The Prudential
Insurance Company of America, Pruco Life Insurance Company, and Pruco Life Insurance
Company of New Jersey (collectively, the �Partners�). 
The following analysis of the
liquidity and capital resources and results of operations of the Partnership should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. 
(a) Liquidity and
Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2004, the
Partnership�s liquid assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents were
approximately $17.6 million, a decrease of approximately $1.3 million from $18.9 million
at December 31, 2003. Sources of liquidity include net cash flow from property operations,
interest from short-term investments, sales, and financings. The Partnership uses cash for
its real estate investment activities and for distribution to its partners. As of December
31, 2004, 7.3% of the Partnership�s total assets consisted of cash and short-term
obligations. 
Dispositions for the year included
the sale of two apartment complexes located in Salem, Oregon. The Joint Venture between
the Partnership and its co-investor sold the two apartment complexes for a total of $7.1
million, which resulted in a realized gain of $1.7 million. 
Subsequent to the end of the
reporting period, one additional apartment asset located in Salem, Oregon sold for $4.65
million on March 10, 2005. Proceeds from the sale were used to fully payoff the Special
Loan, resulting in a realized loss of approximately $1.6 million for the property. 
The Partnership spent approximately
$8.3 million on capital improvements to existing properties. Approximately $2.5 million
was associated with leasing related costs and tenant improvements at one of the office
buildings located in Brentwood, Tennessee. $1.6 million was associated with renovation of
the apartment complex in Atlanta, Georgia and $0.8 million was associated with renovation
and redevelopment of the retail center in Roswell, GA. Of the remaining $3.4 million
balance, $2.0 million was associated with the expansion of the retail center located in
Ocean City, Maryland. The Partnership also increased its investment by approximately $0.2
million in connection with redevelopment and expansion activities at the retail centers
located in Kansas City, Missouri. 
The Partnership provided, to a
developer, short-term financing of approximately $5.0 million for the acquisition of a
retail center located in Westminster, Maryland. The loan was repaid to the Partnership on
September 13, 2004 together with interest at 10.5% upon obtaining third party construction
financing. In addition, the Partnership invested in a Leasehold Mortgage Loan for the
acquisition and redevelopment of an adjacent retail center in Westminster, Maryland. As of
December 31, 2004, approximately $1.3 million was funded with interest accruing at 10% per
annum. 
(b) Results of Operations 
The following is a brief year-to-date
comparison of the Partnership�s results of operations for the periods ended December
31, 2004 and 2003. 
December 31, 2004 vs.
December 31, 2003 
The following table presents a
year-to-date comparison of the Partnership�s sources of net investment income, and
realized and unrealized gains or losses by investment type.

Net Investment Income
Overview 
The Partnership�s net investment
income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $7.8 million, a decrease of $2.8 million
when compared to the corresponding period in 2003. The decrease is due to the sale of two
apartment complexes in Salem, Oregon, increased vacancy at the retail center located in
Roswell, Georgia due to a late 2003 lease termination, increased rental concessions within
the apartment portfolio, and soft market conditions and vacancy within the office
portfolio. The Partnership�s acquisition of a controlling interest in a 161-room
hotel located in Lake Oswego, Oregon resulted in a full year of operating income,
partially offsetting the decrease in total net investment income. 
In addition, net investment income in
2003 benefited from a $1.9 million lease termination fee with respect to the retail center
located in Roswell, Georgia. 
Revenue increased $1.6 million in
2004 compared to 2003. Administrative expenses increased $1.7 million in 2004 compared to
2003. Operating expenses increased $2.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003. All of these
increases were due to the Partnership�s acquisition of a controlling interest in a
161-room hotel located in Lake Oswego, Oregon as discussed above. 
Equity in income of real estate
partnership increased $0.07 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase is due to an
increase in revenue associated with expansion of an existing retail center located in
Ocean City, Maryland. 
Interest and equity income on
mortgage loans receivable and other loans receivable was $0.14 million for the year ended
December 2004. This was due to the Leasehold Mortgage Loan associated with the
redevelopment of a retail center in Westminster, Maryland. 
Income from other real estate
investments was $0.25 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This was due to
short-term financing for the acquisition of a retail center located in Westminster,
Maryland. 
Interest on short-term investments
decreased approximately $0.03 million in 2004 when compared to 2003. The decrease is due
primarily to lower cash balances. 
Valuation Overview 
The Partnership recorded an
unrealized gain of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to an
unrealized loss of $6.9 million during the corresponding period in 2003. The 2004
unrealized gain was attributed to the retail and apartment sectors. The retail sector
recorded an unrealized gain totaling $2.1 million, primarily due to strengthening market
fundamentals, renovation and re-leasing efforts at the Partnership�s retail centers.
The apartment portfolio recorded unrealized and realized gain of $1.1 million. While
market conditions remain soft in the apartment sector, continued investor demand has
increased valuations. The two office assets located in Brentwood, Tennessee recorded
unrealized gains of $3.4 million in 2004; however, this was offset by continued weak
market fundamentals in the office sector.

Net Investment Income 
Net investment income for the
Partnership�s office portfolio was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
an increase of $0.1 million, when compared to the corresponding period in 2003. 
Unrealized Gain/Loss 
The five office properties owned by
the Partnership recorded an aggregate unrealized gain of approximately $0.2 million during
2004. Large gains were recorded at both assets in Brentwood, Tennessee, mainly due to
strengthening market conditions, increasing rents, and stabilized occupancy. Offsetting
these gains were losses recorded at the office complexes located in Lisle and Oakbrook
Terrace, Illinois and Beaverton, Oregon primarily due to lower market rents, decreased
occupancy, and lease up costs associated with attracting new tenants. 
The five office properties owned by
the Partnership recorded an aggregate unrealized loss of approximately $5.8 million during
2003. The losses were primarily due to decreased occupancy, lower market rents, and
increased lease up costs.

Net Investment Income 
Net investment income for the
Partnership�s apartment complexes was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2004, a decrease of $1.2 million, when compared to the corresponding period in 2003. The
decrease was primarily due to (a) mortgage interest incurred for the complex located in
Raleigh, North Carolina that was not applicable during the first six months of 2003, (b)
the loss of income resulting from the sale of two apartment complexes in Salem, Oregon,
and (c) soft market conditions affecting the remaining two apartment complexes located in
Gresham/Salem, Oregon and Jacksonville, FL. 
Unrealized Gain/Loss 
The Partnership recorded an aggregate
unrealized gain of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to an
unrealized loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 on its apartment
complexes. The 2004 unrealized gain was primarily due to continued investor demand, which
has caused an increase in valuations. The unrealized loss of $0.1 million in 2003 was
mainly attributable to increased operating expenses at the apartment complexes located in
Gresham/Salem, Oregon.

Net Investment Income 
Net investment income for the
Partnership�s retail properties decreased approximately $1.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 when compared to the corresponding period in 2003. The principal
component of higher net investment income in 2003 was the $1.9 million lease termination
payment received at the retail center located in Roswell, Georgia. Partially offsetting
the decreases attributable to the Roswell, Georgia property were increases in net
investment income at the center in Ocean City, Maryland as a result of the expansion and
the interest income generated by the Leasehold Mortgage Loan associated with the two
Westminster, Maryland redevelopments. It should also be noted that on April 15, 2003 the
Partnership acquired its joint venture partner�s membership interest in the retail
center located in Hampton, Virginia, thus entitling the Partnership to all of the net
investment income generated by the investment thereafter. 
In late 2004, a new lease was
executed for a 45,600 square foot Publix grocery store in Roswell, Georgia; the lease term
is 20 years; rent commences upon completion of a new store (estimated to be in late 2005). 
Unrealized Gain/Loss 
The retail properties recorded an
aggregate unrealized gain of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Kansas
City, Kansas and Hampton, Virginia retail centers recorded unrealized gains primarily due
to strengthening market fundamentals. The Ocean City, Maryland retail center recorded a
gain due to completion of a pre-leased expansion of the center. Partially offsetting these
gains was an unrealized loss of $2.5 million recorded at the retail center located in
Roswell, Georgia due to the likely loss of a major anchor tenant at the expiration of its
lease in January 2009. 
The retail properties recorded an
aggregate unrealized loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The retail
center located in Hampton, Virginia had recorded an unrealized gain of $0.6 million in
2003 due to continued strengthening market fundamentals. The retail center in Ocean City,
Maryland had recorded a net unrealized gain of $1.5 million in 2003 due to renovation and
re-leasing efforts. Offsetting these gains was the unrealized loss for the Kansas City,
Kansas retail centers, primarily due to renovations from the expansion of the existing
grocery store anchor, which were not reflected as an increase in market value. In
addition, an unrealized loss for the Roswell, Georgia retail center was recorded due to
decreases in market rental rates and shorter-term lease renewals.

Net Investment Income 
Net investment income for the
Partnership�s industrial properties was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2004, a decrease of $0.1 million, when compared to the corresponding period in 2003. The
decrease was due to the loss of rent associated with the 2003 sale of the Salt Lake City
asset. This was offset by an early termination penalty payment at the Aurora, Colorado
asset. 
Unrealized Gain/Loss 
The Aurora, Colorado industrial
property owned by the Partnership recorded an unrealized loss of $0.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004, compared to an unrealized loss of approximately $0.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The unrealized loss recorded in 2004 and 2003 were due
to soft market conditions and capital improvements at the property that were not reflected
as an increase in market value. 
Realized Gain 
On January 28, 2003 the industrial
property located in Salt Lake City, Utah was sold for a realized gain of $0.5 million.

Net Investment Income 
On December 10, 2003, the Partnership
acquired a controlling interest in a 161-room hotel located in Lake Oswego, Oregon for
$8.0 million. Net investment income from hotel operations was $0.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. 
Unrealized Gain/Loss 
The Lake Oswego, Oregon hotel
property owned by the Partnership recorded an unrealized gain of $0.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. 
Other 
Other net investment income decreased
$0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the corresponding period
in 2003. Other net investment income includes interest income from short-term investments,
investment management fees, and portfolio level expenses. 
(c) Inflation 
The Partnership�s leases with a
majority of its commercial tenants provide for recoveries of expenses based upon the
tenant�s proportionate share of, and/or increases in, real estate taxes and certain
operating costs, which may reduce the Partnership�s exposure to increases in
operating costs resulting from inflation. 
Critical Accounting
Policies 
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a
significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews critical
estimates and assumptions. If management determines, as a result of its consideration of
facts and circumstances that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate,
results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated Financial
Statements may change significantly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
The following sections discuss
critical accounting policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements
that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. 
Valuation of Investments 
Real Estate Investments �
The Partnership�s investments in real estate are initially carried at their purchase
price. Subsequently, real estate investments are reported at their estimated market values
based upon appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers (members of
the Appraisal Institute or an equivalent organization) within a reasonable amount of time
following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter,
with independent updates quarterly. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of Prudential
Investment Management (�PIM�) is responsible to assure that the valuation
process provides objective and reasonable market value estimates. 
The purpose of an appraisal is to
estimate the market value of real estate as of a specific date. Market value has been
defined as the most probable price for which the appraised real estate will sell in a
competitive market under all conditions requisite for a fair sale, with the buyer and
seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and for self interest, and assuming that
neither is under undue duress. 
Unconsolidated real estate
partnerships are valued at the Partnership�s equity in net assets as reflected in the
partnership�s financial statements with properties valued as described above. 
Mortgage and other loans receivable,
which are accounted for as loans, are independently valued according to the same appraisal
process as other investments in real estate. 
Other real estate investments include
notes receivable, which are valued at the amount due and approximate market value. 
As described above, the estimated
market value of real estate and real estate related assets is determined through an
appraisal process, except for other real estate investments, which are determined as
stated above. These estimated market values may vary significantly from the prices at
which the real estate investments would sell since market prices of real estate
investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller.
Although the estimated market values represent subjective estimates, management believes
these estimated market values are reasonable approximations of market prices and the
aggregate value of investments in real estate is fairly presented as of December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003. 
QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
Interest Rate Risk. The
Partnership�s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to
about 32.85% of its investment portfolio consisting primarily of short-term fixed rate
commercial paper and fixed and variable interest rate debt. The Partnership does not use
derivative financial instruments. By policy, the Partnership places its investments with
high quality debt security issuers, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer, limits duration by restricting the term, and holds investments to maturity except
under rare circumstances. 
The table below presents the amounts
and related weighted interest rates of the Partnership�s cash equivalents and
short-term investments at December 31, 2004: 

                                                            Estimated Market Value

            Cash equivalents             0-3 months                  $17.6                          5.18%

The table below discloses the
Partnership�s fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2004. All of the Partnership�s
long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these
instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The following table presents
principal cash flows (in thousands) based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and
the related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate
debt.

The Partnership is exposed to market
risk from tenants. While the Partnership has not experienced any significant credit
losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic
downturn, defaults could increase and result in losses to the Partnership, which would
adversely affect its operating results and liquidity.

                              NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF
                  PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT
                                      December 31, 2004

Note 1:   General

Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account ("Account") was established on October 30, 1987 by resolution of the Board of Directors of Pruco
Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ("Pruco Life of New Jersey"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential"),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. ("PFI") as a separate investment account pursuant to New Jersey law and is registered under the Securities
Act of 1933.  The assets of the Account are segregated from Pruco Life of New Jersey's other assets.  The Account is used to fund benefits under certain variable
life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by Pruco Life of New Jersey. These products are Appreciable Life ("VAL"), Variable Life ("VLI"), Discovery Plus
("SPVA"), and Discovery Life Plus ("SPVL").

The assets of the Account are invested in The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the "Partnership").  The Partnership is the investment vehicle
for assets allocated to the real estate investment option under certain variable life insurance and annuity contracts.  The Account, along with the Pruco Life Variable
Contract Real Property Account and The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Account, are the sole investors in the Partnership.  These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Partnership.

The Partnership has a policy of investing at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate and participating mortgage loans.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A.  Basis of Accounting

The accompanying financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  The preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

B.  Investment in Partnership Interest

The investment in the Partnership is based on the Account's proportionate interest of the Partnership's market value.  At December 31, 2004 and 2003 the Account's
interest in the Partnership was 4.3% or 309,093 shares and 4.3% or 318,217 shares respectively.

C.  Income Recognition

Net investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized daily.  Amounts are based upon the Account's proportionate interest in the Partnership.

D.  Equity of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey

Pruco Life of New Jersey maintains a position in the Account for liquidity purposes, including unit purchases and redemptions, Partnership share transactions, and expense
processing.  The position does not affect contract owners' accounts or the related unit values.

Note 3:   Taxes

Pruco Life of New Jersey is taxed as a "life insurance company" as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.  The results of operations of the Account form a part of PFI's
consolidated federal tax return. Under current federal law, no federal income taxes are payable by the Account.  As such, no provision for the tax liability has been
recorded in these financial statements.

Note 7:   Financial Highlights

Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (the "Company" or "Prudential") sells a number of variable annuity and variable life insurance products.  These
products have unique combinations of features and fees that are charged against the contract owner's account balance.  Differences in  the
fee structures result in a variety of unit values, expense ratios and total returns.

The following table was developed by determining which products offered by Pruco Life of New Jersey have the lowest and highest total expense ratio.  The
summary may not reflect the minimum and maximum contract charges offered by the Company as contract owners may not have selected all available and applicable
contract options as discussed in Note 1.  The table reflects contract owner units only.

The table above reflects information for units held by contract owners.  Pruco Life of New Jersey also maintains a position in the Real Property Account, to provide for property
acquisitions and capital expenditure funding needs.  Pruco Life of New Jersey held 875,413, 901,524, 1,393,587 and 1,304,664 units representing $ 2,040,688, $1,993,278, $3,036,542
and $2,826,338 of net assets as of December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Charges for mortality risk, expense risk and administrative expenses are used by Pruco Life
of New Jersey to purchase additional units in its account resulting in no impact of its net assets.

*  This amount represents the proportionate share of the net investment income from the underlying Partnership divided by the total average assets of the Account.  This ratio excludes
those expenses, such as mortality and expense charges, that result in direct reductions in the unit values.

**  These ratios represent the annualized contract expenses of the separate account, consisting primarily of mortality and expense charges, for each period indicated.  The ratios
include only those expenses that result in a direct reduction to unit values.  Charges made directly to contract owner accounts through the redemption of units and expenses of the
underlying Partnership are excluded.

***  These amounts represent the total return for the periods indicated, including changes in the value of the underlying Partnership, and reflect deductions for all items included
in the expense ratio. The total return does not include any expense assessed through the redemption of units; inclusion of these expenses in the calculation would result in a reduction
in the total return presented.

Charges and Expenses

A.  Mortality Risk and Expense Risk Charges

Mortality risk and expense risk charges are determined daily using an effective annual rate of 0.6%, 0.35%, 0.9% and 0.9% for VAL, VLI, SPVA, SPVL, respectively.  Mortality risk is that
life insurance contract owners may not live as long as estimated or annuitants may live longer than estimated and expense risk is that the cost of issuing and administering the policies
may exceed related charges by Pruco Life of New Jersey.  The mortality risk and expense risk charges are assessed through reduction in unit values.

B.  Administrative Charges

Administrative charges are determined daily using an effective annual rate of 0.35% applied daily against the net assets representing equity of contract owners held in each subaccount for
SPVA and SPVL.  Administrative charges include costs associated with issuing the contract, establishing and maintaining records, and providing reports to contract owners.  The administrative
charge is assessed through reduction in unit values.

C.  Cost of Insurance and Other Related Charges

Contract owner contributions are subject to certain deductions prior to being invested in the Real Property Account.  The deductions for VAL and VLI are (1) state premium taxes; (2) sales
charges, not to exceed 5% for VAL and 9% for VLI, which are deducted in order to compensate Pruco Life of New Jersey for the cost of selling the contract and (3) transaction costs, applicable
to VAL, are deducted from each premium payment to cover premium collection and processing costs.  Contracts are also subject to monthly charges for the costs of administering the contract to
compensate Pruco Life of New Jersey for the guaranteed minimum death benefit risk.  These charges are assesseed through the redemption of units.

D.  Deferred Sales Charge

Subsequent to a contract owner redemption, a deferred sales charge is imposed upon surrenders of certain variable life insurance contracts to compensate Pruco Life of New Jersey for sales and
other marketing expenses.  The amount of any sales charge will depend on the number of years that have elapsed since the contract was issued but will not exceed 45% of one scheduled annual
premium for VAL cotracts and 9% of the initial premium payment for SPVL.  No sales charge will be imposed after the sixth and tenth year of the contract for SPVL and VAL, respectively.  No
sales charge will be imposed on death benefits.  A deferred sales charge is assessed through the redemption of units.

E.  Partial Withdrawal Charge

A charge is imposed by Pruco Life of New Jersey on partial withdrawals of the cash surrender value for VAL.  A charge equal to the lesser of $15 or 2% will be made in connection with each
partial withdrawal of the cash surrender value of a contract.  A charge is assessed through the redemption of units.

Note 8:  Related Party

Prudential and its affiliates perform various services on behalf of the Partnership in which the Account invests and may receive fees for the services performed.  These services include,
among other things, shareholder communications, preparation, postage, fund transfer agency and various other record keeping and customer service functions.

THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP
For Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002

Note 1: 

Organization  
On April 29, 1988, The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the �Partnership�), a general partnership organized under New Jersey law, was formed through an agreement among The Prudential Insurance Company of America (�Prudential�), Pruco Life Insurance Company (�Pruco Life�), and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (�Pruco Life of New Jersey�). The Partnership was established as a means by which assets allocated to the real estate investment option under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by the respective companies could be invested in a commingled pool. The partners in the Partnership are Prudential, Pruco Life and Pruco Life
of New Jersey. 
The Partnership�s policy is to invest at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate and participating mortgage loans. 
The estimated market value of the Partnership�s shares is determined daily, consistent with the Partnership Agreement. On each day during which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business, the net asset value of the Partnership is estimated using the estimated market value of its assets, principally as described in Notes 2A, 2B and 2C below, reduced by any liabilities of the Partnership. The periodic adjustments to property values described in Notes 2A, 2B and 2C below and other adjustments to previous estimates are made on a prospective basis. There can be no assurance that all such adjustments to estimates will be made timely.
Shares of the Partnership are held by The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Account, Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account and Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account (the �Real Property Accounts�) and may be purchased and sold at the then current share value of the Partnership�s net assets. Share value is calculated by dividing the estimated market value of net assets of the Partnership as determined above by the number of shares outstanding. A contract owner participates in the Partnership through interests in the Real Property Accounts.

Prudential Real Estate Investors (�PREI�) is the real estate advisory unit of Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (�PIM�), which is an indirectly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial Inc. (�PFI�). PREI provides investment advisory services to the Partnership�s partners pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement as described in Note 9.



Note 2: 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

� 


�

A: 

Basis of Presentation�The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Partnership have been presented on the market value basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It is the Partnership�s policy to consolidate those real estate partnerships in which it has a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  





  
�



: 

Management�s Use of Estimates in the Financial Statements�The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  


C: 

Real Estate Investments�Real estate investments are shown at estimated market value in accordance with the terms of the Partnership�s contracts. Properties owned are initially recorded at the purchase price plus closing costs. Development costs and major renovations are capitalized as a component of cost, and routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Real estate costs include the cost of acquired property, including all the tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets include the value of all land, building and tenant improvements at the time of acquisition. Intangible assets include the value of any above and below market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships at the time of acquisition. Market value estimates are based upon property appraisal
reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers (members of the Appraisal Institute or an equivalent organization) within a reasonable amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of PIM is responsible to

assure that the valuation process provides independent and reasonable property market value estimates. American Appraisal Associates (the �Appraisal Management Firm�), an entity not affiliated with PIM, has been appointed by PIM to assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and the accuracy of the appraisal process. The market value of real estate investments does not reflect the transaction sale costs, which may be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments.
Unconsolidated real estate partnerships are valued at the Partnership�s equity in net assets as reflected in the partnerships� financial statements with properties valued as described above. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at the original investment amount, plus additional amounts invested, and is subsequently adjusted for the Partnership�s share of undistributed earnings or losses (including unrealized appreciation and depreciation) from the underlying entity.
As described above, the estimated market value of real estate and real estate related assets is determined through an appraisal process. These estimated market values may vary significantly from the prices at which the real estate investments would sell, since market prices of real estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. Although the estimated market values represent subjective estimates, management believes these estimated market values are reasonable approximations of market prices and the aggregate estimated value of investments in real estate is fairly presented as of December 31, 2004.



D: 

Other Real Estate Investments�Other real estate investments include notes receivable, which are valued at the amount due and approximate market value.   
�



E: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents�Cash and cash equivalent are comprised of all short-term investments and investments in money market funds with a maximum maturity of three months. Cash equivalents consist of investments in the Prudential Investment Liquidity Pool offered and managed by an affiliate of PFI and are accounted for at market value.   


F: 

Marketable Securities�Marketable securities are highly liquid investments with maturities of more than three months when purchased and are carried at estimated market value.  


G: 

Other Assets�Cash of $212,989 and $216,883 was maintained by the wholly owned and consolidated properties at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for tenant security deposits and is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Other assets also includes tenant receivable and is net of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $46,690 and $76,800 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  


H: 

Mortgage Loans Payable�Mortgage loans payable are stated at the principal amount of the obligation outstanding. At times the Partnership may assume debt in connection with the purchase of real estate. For debt assumed, the Partnership allocates a portion of the purchase price to the below/above market debt and amortizes the premium/discount over the remaining life of the debt.  


I: 

Deferred Financing Costs�Included in Other Assets are deferred financing costs amounting to $391,666 and $313,425, which are net of accumulated amortization of $878,316 and $713,990 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and which are being amortized over the term of the related obligation.

�

J: 

Revenue Recognition�Revenue from real estate is recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the respective leases. Revenue from certain real estate investments is net of all or a portion of related real estate expenses, as lease arrangements vary as to responsibility for payment of these expenses between tenants and the Partnership. Since real estate is stated at estimated market value, net income is not reduced by depreciation or amortization expense.   


�

K: 

Equity in Income of Real Estate Partnership�Equity in income from real estate partnership operations represents the Partnership�s share of the current year�s partnership income as provided for under the terms of the partnership agreements. As is the case with wholly-owned real estate, partnership net income is not reduced by depreciation or amortization expense. Frequency of distribution of income is determined by formal agreements or by the executive committee of the partnership.   


�

L: 

Federal Income Taxes�The Partnership is not a taxable entity under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The income and capital gains and losses of the Partnership are attributed, for federal income tax purposes, to the Partners in the Partnership. The Partnership may be subject to state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.  


�

M: 

New Accounting Pronouncements�FASB Interpretation No. 46, �Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities�, (�FIN 46�) was issued in January 2003. In December 2003, FASB issued a revised interpretation of FIN 46 (�FIN 46-R�), which supersedes FIN 46. FIN 46-R defers the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN-46 for those companies currently accounting for their investments in accordance with the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, �Audits of Investment Companies� (the �Audit Guide�). The effective date is delayed while the AICPA finalizes the proposed Statement of Position (�SOP�) on the clarification of the scope of the Audit Guide. Following the issuance of the final SOP, the FASB will consider modifying FIN 46-R to provide an
exception for companies that apply the Audit Guide. The Partnership is awaiting the final determination from the FASB in order to evaluate the extent in which, if any, its equity investments may need to be consolidated as a result of this FIN 46-R.  


Note 3: 

Disclosure of Supplemental Cash Flow Information and Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activity

Note 9: Commitments and Contingencies
In 1986, Prudential committed to fund up to $100 million to enable the Partnership to acquire real estate investments. Contributions to the Partnership under this commitment have been utilized for property acquisitions, and were to be returned to Prudential on an ongoing basis from contract owners� net contributions and other available cash. The amount of the commitment has been reduced by $10 million for every $100 million in current value net assets of the Partnership. As of December 31, 2004, the cost basis of Prudential�s equity interest in the Partnership under this commitment (held through the Real Property Accounts) was $44 million. Prudential terminated this commitment on December 31, 2002.
The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. In the opinion of Prudential's management, the outcome of such matters will not have a significant effect on the financial position of the Partnership.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Partners of The Prudential
Variable Contract Real Property Partnership
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of The Prudential Insurance Company of America.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PART II 
INFORMATION NOT
REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS 

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION
OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
The Registrant, in connection with
certain affiliates, maintains various insurance coverages under which the underwriter and
certain affiliated persons may be insured against liability which may be incurred in such
capacity, subject to the terms, conditions, and exclusions of the insurance policies. 
New Jersey, being the state of
organization of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ("Pruco Life of New Jersey"), permits
entities organized under its jurisdiction to indemnify directors and officers with certain
limitations. The relevant provisions of New Jersey law permitting indemnification can be
found in Section 14A:3-5 of the New Jersey Statutes Annotated. The text of
Pruco Life of New Jersey's By-law Article V, which relates to indemnification of
officers and directors, is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 1.A.(6)(c) to its Form S-6,
Registration No. 333-85117, filed August 13, 1999 on behalf of the Pruco Life of New Jersey
Variable Appreciable Account.  
Insofar as indemnification for
liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be
permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the
foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of
the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of
expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant
in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

April 11, 2005

Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey
213 Washington Street
Newark, New Jersey 07102-2992
�
Gentlemen:
�
In my capacity as Chief Legal Officer of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ("Pruco Life of New Jersey"), I have reviewed the establishment of Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account (the "Account") on October 30, 1987 by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Pruco Life of New Jersey as a separate account for assets applicable to certain variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17B:28-7 of the Revised Statutes of New Jersey.  I was responsible for the oversight of the preparation and review of the Registration
Statement on Form S-1, as amended, filed by Pruco Life of New Jersey with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Registration No. 33-20018) under the Securities Act of 1933 for the registration of the Account.
�
I am of the following opinion:
�



(1) 

Pruco Life of New Jersey was duly organized under the laws of New Jersey and is a validly existing corporation.  
�



(2) 

The Account has been duly created and is validly existing as a separate account pursuant to the aforesaid provisions of New Jersey law.  
�



(3) 

The portion of the assets held in the Account equal to the reserves and other liabilities for variable benefits under the variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts is not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business Pruco Life of New Jersey may conduct.  
�



(4) 

The variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts are legal and binding obligations of Pruco Life of New Jersey in accordance with their terms.  
�
In arriving at the foregoing opinion, I have made such examination of law and examined such records and other documents as I judged to be necessary or appropriate.
�
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
�
Very truly yours,
�

Back to topProperty Agreement BasicsWhen dealing with real estate, you want to cover all your bases. A Property Agreement can help address everyone's best interest. After all, property is usually a person's biggest investment. You may be putting hundreds of thousands-or even millions-on the table, so there's no room for mistakes. A lot can happen between the offer and the handing over the keys. Signing a Property Agreement means that both buyer and seller have made a commitment-neither can back out without a good reason, and breaking the agreement usually means paying a penalty. If you're a buyer, you'll likely have to hand over some earnest money as part of a Property Agreement. Don't skimp on the details: create a Property Agreement to give your real estate deal a strong foundation.

Back to topConsent to Sublease BasicsMaking sure the details of a new sublease agreement are clearly ironed out, and documented, is important for everyone involved—the tenant, the subletter, and the landlord all benefit from a Consent to Sublease. As many landlords don't allow subleasing, if you're the tenant you'll need to check your lease first. Even if it's not allowed according to the lease, you can check with your landlord and you may discover they're amenable to a sublease. And as a landlord, subleasing can ensure continuance of rent payment if your current tenant is unable to fulfill their obligations. Whether you're the tenant, landlord, or potential subletting tenant, everyone can be on the same page, in writing, with a Consent to Sublease.
