 A. Maurice Myers 1940— Biography



      A. Maurice Myers
      
      1940–
    











        Former chairman, Waste Management
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: May 20, 1940, in Long Beach, California.
    

      Education: California State University at Fullerton, BA, 1964; California
      State University at Long Beach, MBA, 1972.
    

      Family: Son of Walter R. Myers and H. Priscilla Larsen; married Elizabeth
      Jean Ashburn, 1960; children: three.
    

      Career: Ford Motor Company, 1964–1972, financial manager; Merrill
      Lynch, 1972–1975, financial consultant; Continental Airlines,
      1975–1982, Passenger Marketing director; On TV, 1983, vice
      president of operations; Aloha Airgroup, 1983–1993, president and
      CEO; America West Airlines, 1993–1995, president; Yellow
      Corporation, 1996–1999, chairman, CEO, and president; Waste
      Management, 1999–2004, CEO and president; 2004, chairman.
    

      ■ After a successful 10-year stint with the Hawaii-based Aloha
      Airgroup, A. Maurice Myers was widely known as an efficient leader who
      specialized in improving the viability and fortunes of troubled companies.
      After Aloha, Myers moved on to lead a team of troubleshooters in
      stabilizing America West Airlines; he then oversaw the reorganization of
      Yellow Corporation, the major ground-transportation company. His final
      challenge would be to reorganize Waste Management; he carefully guided the
      company out of a turbulent period of acquisitions and complicated
      upheaval, bringing order, stability, and profitability to the enlarged
      entity as its president and chief executive officer. Once he had achieved
      his basic overall goals, Myers decided to retire and enjoy his accumulated
      wealth while still relatively young.
    

      With an energetic, hands-on management style, throughout his adult career
      Myers consistently promoted the maximal use of high-quality computer
      technology in improving external customer relations and internal
      management. Myers was known as "Maury" by coworkers and some
      analysts, who described his efforts to make systemic technical
      improvements in corporate culture and operations as generally successful.

      ORGANIZATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
    

      Myers first acquired important business skills while enrolled in the
      financial-management training program at Ford Motor Company. He continued
      his development on the job, earning an MBA and becoming a consultant for
      Merrill Lynch. He began developing his talents on a greater scale when he
      became a senior director in the Passenger Marketing department of
      Continental Airlines. Emphasizing public relations and good service, he
      learned much about the workings of the transportation industry during a
      flurry of government deregulation.
    

      In what became his first major test, Myers moved to Hawaii to become the
      chief executive officer of Aloha Airgroup. He instituted a frequent-flyer
      program and experimented with an increase in international route expansion
      before concentrating on the intra–Hawaiian Islands passenger and
      freight market.
       Aloha thereby survived the fallout of deregulation while rivals perished.
      His methods incorporated a careful focus on procurement and maintenance,
      the building of a more reliable communications infrastructure, and an
      emphasis on customer satisfaction. After his success with Aloha, Myers
      provided much the same leadership for the Phoenix-based America West
      Airlines when he became the company's president.
    

      Having established a reputation as an executive who could turn around
      slumping companies, Myers next moved on to head Yellow Corporation, where
      he used his by then well-tried methods—again successfully and again
      on a grander scale. Myers embraced Internet-based commerce, developing and
      expanding its capabilities as a customer-relations tool and for accurate,
      quick-response tracking of goods and services. Myers emphasized that
      excellent information services, including accounting and
      information-management systems, were an essential element in corporate
      infrastructure. He would later tell London's 
      
        Economist
      
       in a basic but telling philosophical formulation, "If you cannot
      measure it, you cannot manage it" (June 30, 2001).
    

      MR. FIX-IT
    

      For his last hurrah Myers took the reins of Waste Management in the
      chaotic wake of its huge merger with USA Waste Services and additional
      acquisitions. He organized an efficient and energetic management team to
      build a new infrastructure that would be managed from corporate
      headquarters in Houston. Though, as he told a staff reporter for the 
      
        Houston Chronicle
      
      , he enjoyed "taking on fix-it jobs," he made clear
      relatively early in his tenure that the position would be his last before
      retirement (November 9, 1999).
    

      The recovery task was formidable, but Myers carefully laid out and began
      implementing a strategy to develop a new companywide information system,
      improve customer service in all areas, investigate in detail suitable
      locales for careful market development, and improve procurement and
      maintenance methods and choices. As he observed in an interview with 
      
        Waste Age
      
      , his vision was to create a successful "transition from a roll-up
      or consolidation business model to a model based on operational
      excellence," embracing "initiatives finally integrating all
      of the 1,400 acquisitions we've made over the years into a single
      operation" (January 2002).
    

      Having gone far in setting up and implementing his ideas for new economies
      of scale and instituting cultural changes in the use of information
      technology and in Waste Management's commitment to customer
      relations, Myers promoted members from his management team and selected
      his own replacement. In March 2004 he stepped back to serve as chairman of
      the board of directors as a prelude to his retirement in November. Waste
      Management had gained new footing and was able to improve its profit
      margins.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
