Primary Services Provided:


Managed Portfolios of Publicly Traded REIT and Energy Industry Securities

          Inland Investment Advisors designs and manages  portfolios comprised of publicly traded securities of REITs and companies focused in energy infrastructure. Each portfolio is customized to meet the client’s specific investment objective, liquidity needs and risk tolerances. We believe our publicly managed portfolios are an ideal solution for clients who want real estate and energy exposure, typically illiquid asset classes, but require liquidity to meet their future cash flow or capital needs.


Joint Venture Partnerships/ Direct Private Real Estate Investments

          Inland Investment Advisors provides its clients access to unique co-investment opportunities with an experienced real estate partner/sponsor/developer. The Inland Group’s vast network of real estate partners provides a robust deal flow and allows our team to source opportunities on a national level, across multiple property types, with specific emphasis on customized real estate strategies to meet the identified risk/return profile of our investment partners.
            

 Core Investments:
These investments are geared towards conservative investors who are seeking stabilized, well located and leased income-producing properties with a lower risk return profile and commensurate returns depending on product type, location, term of lease(s) and credit quality of the tenant(s).


 Opportunistic Investments:
Inland offers alternative investment opportunities through joint ventures and co-investment arrangements, whereby qualified investors can participate directly in the development and/or redevelopment of commercial and residential real estate opportunities.  These investments can include new development or “greenfield” projects.


 1031 Exchange Opportunities:
In cooperation with Inland Private Capital Corporation (“IPCC”), Inland Investment Advisors assists clients looking for customized 1031 exchange opportunities. IPCC is the market leader in the origination, securitization and management of 1031 real estate exchange properties for both individual and institutional real estate investors.  IPCC’s portfolio includes single/multi-tenant commercial office, retail, industrial buildings and multi-family residential apartment communities.  




Blended “Crossover” Portfolios

          Inland Investment Advisors specializes in blended portfolio construction designed to enhance returns for clients and improve cash flow management.  Blended portfolios are a unique mix of public and private real estate investments that, in some cases, involve borrowing against a public real estate portfolio to make direct real estate investments.  A blended portfolio approach offers clients added diversification benefits,  can improve the potential for enhanced returns, or serve as a valuable cash flow management tool.    While the use of leverage  increases risk, it can be a valuable tool in specific investment environments.
          

Collaborative Real Estate Advisory 

           In addition to being an advisor to its clients, Inland Investment Advisors also acts as a sub-advisor to professionals that have a fiduciary obligation to clients, such as, financial advisors, CPAs, investment consultants, CIOs of Family Offices, and attorneys.   Our collaborative advisory services help our clients broaden their real estate services and products by utilizing on our expertise.

Inland American – SEC Probe – Salas Wang Investigation
May 11, 2012


The Wall Street is reporting that the SEC is investigating Inland American Non-Traded REIT.  Our firm has been investigating shareholder claims against brokers who sold shares to investors for sometime.  This recent SEC action, we believe, is the culmination of years of abuse.  According to the WSJ:
The SEC is looking at activity of Inland American Real Estate Trust to determine if the REIT committed violations related to management fees, the timing and amount of distributions paid to investors, and transactions with affiliates, according to a company filing with the SEC on Monday.
If you own shares of Inland American, please call Jeffrey Salas at 312.803.4963 or fill out the contact form below.
