I was surprised that several of the restaurants we frequent were on the list so I've earned some cash back for that. My problems with this app are: It appears that the only "in person" offers are for restaurants. All shopping offers seem to be online. I'm hoping that as time goes on there will be more pertinent offers for me and my lifestyle.   Full Review       DOSH LLC June 29, 2017  HI, Thanks for trying out Dosh! Since we just launched, we may have limited in person offers in some areas. However, the good news is we are adding more and more every day! Plus, if you live in an area where there are not a lot of offers, you have the opportunity to refer your favorite merchants and get rewarded when they sign up!

The browsing experience has been pathetic and most of the retailers have their own mobile app for better experience. Since I have already linked my card, it would be better to track the transaction and credit with dosh balance for a deal. About the referral system why can't I just copy the link and share it to whatever platform I want ???   Full Review       DOSH LLC June 29, 2017  Hi, 
In the NEARBY offers section, you can use your connected card in person at retailers and get cash back, not just online.
For sharing, you can click the "social sharing" button in the app and it will share to your email, text, or social channels. You also have the option to copy your referral link to your phone.                  Heather Walters  April 27, 2017                         I haven't been able to purchase anything.

This issue is apparently very common. This app was not ready for the market. Don't respond to this, you're obviously just trying to save face by responding to bad reviews and implying it's the users fault. Next time, release a usable product.
