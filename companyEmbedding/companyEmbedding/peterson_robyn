Switching from Windows to Mac


my first macbook weekend


current state of the switch



i wasn't born with a mac in my hands, but i grew up drinking apple's kool-aid. lots of kids had imaginary friends, some played little league or lusted after scout badges, but my childhood revolved around a boxy, and what now seems to be excruciatingly inadequate, apple iie.
apple was good to me over the years, through high school and beyond. but just like everyone else, after college i was thrust into the world of microsoft windows. business in the "real world" requires wintel, i was told. as much as it broke my heart, i made the platform switch. but i survived. 
hear robyn explain why he switched from windows to mac on gearlog radio. download the mp3!
the here and now
two weeks ago, while browsing through a stack of dvds stored in my living-room closet, i stumbled across two different videos shot at my wedding (one by my father-in-law and the other by a friend). i'd always intended to edit these two videos together and dub in music whenever the audio went south. but manipulating audio and video can be a pain on windows. i've used adobe premiere before, and in my experience, sometimes it works and sometimes it crashes. i had no desire to spend the summer weekends ripping out my hair.
"how about using imovie?" a colleague asked. "if only i had a mac," i responded. but wait. i was in the market to buy a new computer.

Apple MacBook 13-inch

Apple MacBook 13-inch



Apple iMac (Intel Core Duo)

Apple iMac (Intel Core Duo)




i live in a windows world, at home and the office. and historically, macs don't play nicely in a windows world. but with the advent of the core duo t2500 (2.0 ghz) processor in the macbook, it all changed. macs could now run on windows if absolutely necessary (via apple's boot camp) . note that i had no intention of installing windows on a macand i'm not just saying this to save face with my bossbut it was nice to know the option existed. and with that the last of my reservations fell away.

i drove to the apple store and bought an apple macbook 13-inch, with a 2-ghz processor, 80gb hard drive, and 1gb of memory, for $1,334. because my wife is a student, they gave us a free 2gb ipod nano, a free hp photosmart c3180 all-in-one printer, and $50 off microsoft office 2004 (necessary to stay compatible with work). killer deal.
i smiled all the way home, until my wife reminded me that it was our third anniversary and i had purchased myself an expensive gift. even with the threat of spending my weekend nights sleeping on the couch, i ripped open the box and booted os x tiger for the first time at home. welcome back, old friend.my first macbook weekend >
