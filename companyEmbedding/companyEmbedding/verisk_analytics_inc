Verisk Analytics To Acquire G2 Web Services For Financial Risk Solutions - Verisk Analytics Inc (NASDAQ:VRSK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Verisk Analytics To Acquire G2 Web Services For Financial Risk SolutionsJul.28.17 | About: Verisk Analytics (VRSK) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryVerisk Analytics intends to acquire G2 Web Services for $112 million in cash.G2 has created unique data sets that assist financial firms in detecting bad actors, fraudulent activity and remaining in regulatory compliance.The acquisition will be combined with Argus, Verisk's financial analytics and compliance business, and is a continuation of Verisk' active M&A strategy.



 Quick Take Data analytics company Verisk Analytics (VRSK) has announced an agreement to acquire G2 Web Services for $112 million in an all cash deal. G2 has developed technologies that assist payment processors in determining merchant risk for prospective and existing merchants. The deal promises to combine G2’s unique data sets with Verisk’s Argus unit to provide financial institutions with improved fraud, bad-actor detection and compliance requirements. Target Company Bellevue, Washington-based G2 was founded in 2004 to create merchant risk management technologies for due diligence, ongoing compliance, and fraud protection purposes. Management is headed by Allison Guidette, who has been with the company since 2014 and previously held senior positions at Thomson Reuters and Merrill Corporation. Below is a brief demo video about G2’s approach to KYC processes for commercial banks:  (Source: G2 Web Services) G2 has developed a robust partner network, which includes the following groups, 


 (Source: G2 Web Services) Little is known about G2’s investment history, other than a seed financing round was disclosed in 2011 from investor Primus Capital. Acquisition Terms and Rationale Verisk said it would pay $112 million in cash to G2’s stockholders, and that the deal is expected to close in 3Q 2017. As of Verisk’s March 31, 2017 10-Q, the company had $155 million in cash and equivalents and total liabilities of $3.36 billion. It’s operating cash flow for 1Q 2017 totaled $318 million, even after repaying $100 million of short-term debt. Verisk will presumably take on debt to close the current transaction, although management did not provide any details on how it intends to pay for G2. Upon closing, G2 will be integrated into Verisk’s Argus business so that, as G2’s CEO Allison Guidette stated, By joining with Argus, we will take our proprietary data assets, powerful technology, and deep domain expertise to the next level in helping clients fight fraud, transaction laundering, and reputational risk within the global payments and e-commerce ecosystem. Together we will expand our capabilities to map bad-actor networks, predict payments risk, and provide clients with the best opportunity to reduce losses and fines due to merchant and business fraud and compliance violations. [Italics mine] So, the key for the new combination is to integrate G2’s unique data sets with Argus’ risk forecasting and regulatory platforms to help financial institutions better avoid payment fraud and bad-actors via the KYC requirements as well as remain in regulatory compliance throughout the process. The rise of fraud through the global financial system represents a threat to the security and ongoing business operations of financial firms, as this 2015 Global Fraud Report by Kroll described. Risks have only increased in the few years since that report. The 2015 report chart below shows the numerous categories of fraud and the percentage of companies affected or vulnerable, and the numbers have probably risen since then,
 

(Source: Kroll Global Fraud Report 2015) The acquisition promises to bolster Verisk’s Argus unit’s capabilities to use unique data sets to help combat financial system fraud. As data becomes ever more important to the integrity of the financial system, the deal makes sense as Verisk continues on its busy acquisition pace.

When evaluating the competitive advantage of a data-based analytics business, three important questions come to mind: 1) Is the data proprietary? 2) Are the insights from the data critical? and 3) Does the data fuel a product feedback loop?

How Emerging Brands Care against Established Leaders in Google Search

Hedge Fund Demand Rises As Fee Structure Changes As Earnings Drop To Lowest Since 2005
Verisk Analytics began its operations in 1971 as Insurance Services Offices (ISO), a non-profit enterprise started by P&C insurers to collect industry data and information that was used by its sponsors to determine premium rates, underwrite risk, develop products, and report to regulators, basically acting as a cost center for the P&C industry.  The entity expanded into analytics with its acquisitions of American Insurance Services in 1997 and the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1998 (which brought expertise in claims fraud detection and prevention) before converting to a for-profit organization in 1999 and going public in 2009 as Verisk (ISO became wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk).  The company acquired a bunch of companies from its ISO days to today, bolstering its core insurance risk assessment services and expanding into new industry verticals.
Verisk’s decades-long legacy as the central repository of P&C industry data is the heart and soul of its competitive advantage and has served as the foundation on which all its other offerings have been built over the years.  It is difficult to overstate the critical role that Verisk plays in pricing, claims management, and administrative efficiency across the P&C industry.  For instance, Verisk Analytics sets the de facto industry standard on language – “court-tested” and found in 200mn of the 250mn policies issued in the US – used in policy forms sold to insurers via subscription that ensures consumers are getting the same amount of coverage for the same quote across insurers.
The company sits at the center of a network that procures data from a wide variety of sources (claims settlements, remote imagery, auto OEMs), analyzes it, and delivers predictive insights to clients (insurers, advertisers, property managers).  The agreements through which a customer licenses VRSK’s data also allows the company to make use of that customer’s data….so essentially the customer pays Verisk for a solution that costs almost nothing for the company to deliver and Verisk gets to use that customer’s data to enhance its own solutions, which improved solutions reduce churn and attract even more customers (and their data) in a subsidized feedback loop.  This flywheel, built on top of Verisk’s historical advantage as the repository of industry data, has generated world’s largest claims database (VRSK aggregates claims data from 95% of the P&C industry), containing granular information on 1.1bn claims (up from 700mn claims in 2011), with the insurance ecosystem submitting ~200k new claims a day across all P&C coverage lines.  It would be effectively impossible for a competitor to replicate this ever-burgeoning flurry of data.
[Aside: VRSK’s spending on public clouds has dramatically escalated over the last few years, allowing the company to not only realize considerable cost savings (without public clouds, it would have been far more costly for Verisk to secure engagements with European retail banks, who operate under strict privacy laws that require data to reside within the country of origin) and flexibility as its datasets continue to expand in girth and complexity, but to also apply machine learning to those datasets and enable new functionality to its services].
Comprehensive data paired with a decent model generates better insights than limited data paired with a great model.  An insurer that relies solely on in-house claims experience cannot underwrite risks with nearly the same degree of accuracy as one with access to the entire industry’s data.  Consider all the vehicle ratings variables – make & model, location where the car is garaged (down to one of 220k census blocks), mileage, driver’s record, semi-autonomous / safety features in the vehicle – that VRSK accounts for in assessing loss costs on 323 ISO series cars (cars that are part of the ISO ratings series used to match premiums to type of car).  Or the construction costs – from roofing material to drywall to electrical and HVAC contractor rates – monitored across 460 regions across North America and updated monthly using Verisk’s Xactimate software, which insurers use to quantify replacement costs, including labor and material costs, within 21k unit-cost line items in the event of a claim and compare computed insurance-to-value estimates to those submitted by brokers at the beginning of the underwriting process.  A contractor who shows up to a damaged home after a storm can leverage the 100mn price points stored in Verisk’s database, estimate a policy claim, and then share that information with the policyholder, adjuster, and the claims department.  Like Verisk’s policy forms, Xactimate, too, is an industry standard used to estimate nearly 90% of all personal property claims in the US.
Data is further leveraged to improve efficiency and the front-end experience of insureds.  For instance, per one case study, a large auto insurer typically spent 15 minutes walking a policy seeker through its sales funnel (an initial 40-question quote inquiry that transitioned to processing, where 35% of qualified leads had their initial quotes changed, and finally to binding), with lead leakage at each step along the way, ultimately translating into a conversion rate of just ~7%.  With Verisk’s LightSpeed, the insurer spent less than a minute on the sales process and doubled its conversions.  By sifting through a deluge of 300mn transactions per month pulled from odometer readings, vehicle reports, and claims loss history, Verisk only needs a few pieces of information from the customer upfront to arrive at the right price within seconds at the point of quote.
With claims settlements absorbing 2/3 of the $600bn of premiums collected by the US P&C industry every year (not to mention the $6bn-$8bn of fraudulent auto injury claims), and the industry as a whole generating negligible underwriting margins over time, solutions that improve operating efficiency, improve sales outcomes, and accurately estimate the industry’s largest expense item, are obviously critical.  Verisk’s products are tightly integrated into customers’ workflows and consumed as subscriptions (subscriptions represent ~85% of the company’s revenue).
1) Is the transformed data proprietary?  Check
2) Are the insights from the data critical?  Check
3) Does the data fuel a feedback loop that deepens the data moat?  Check.
VRSK has a nice moat in the P&C vertical.  But of course the best companies not only have dominant competitive advantages around their existing business, but also huge advantaged growth opportunities, and it is here, I’m afraid, that prospects look bleaker.  Here are what management sees as its growth opportunities:
Cross-selling:
Selling existing products to new customers and introducing new products to existing ones.  This is the most compelling opportunity from a probability-of-success standpoint and has motivated much of the recurring tuck-in acquisitions made by the company over the years.  Over the last several years, the company has re-oriented how it approaches the customer, moving away from a siloe’d approach to product sales to integrated teams: most of the company’s sales to insurers are bundled products that improve customer stickiness

Verisk Analytics, Inc. is an American data analytics and risk assessment firm based in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, serving customers worldwide in insurance, natural resources, financial services, government, and risk management. The company uses proprietary data sets and industry expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions in fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverages, fire protection, catastrophe and weather risk, data management, and other fields.
The company was privately held until its October 6, 2009, initial public offering, which raised $1.9 billion for several of the large insurance companies that were its primary shareholders, making it the largest IPO in the United States for the year 2009.[2] The firm did not raise any funds for itself in the IPO, which was designed to provide an opportunity for the firm's casualty and property insurer owners to sell some or all of their holdings and to provide a market price for those retaining their shares. The 2009 IPO was priced at $22 per share for 85.25 million shares owned by its shareholders, including American International Group, The Hartford and Travelers, making it the largest since the 2008 IPO for Visa Inc. In an action described by investment research company Morningstar as a "vote of confidence" in Verisk, Berkshire Hathaway was the only company among the firm's largest shareholders that did not sell any of its stock in the October 2009 IPO.[3]
History[edit]
The company’s Insurance Services Office (ISO) subsidiary was created in 1971 through the consolidation of various state, regional, and national rating bureaus for various lines of property/casualty insurance.[1] ISO helps insurers with product development, underwriting, and rating. In 2008, Verisk Analytics was established to serve as the parent holding company of ISO. In 2009, Verisk completed its IPO and became a publicly traded company.[4]
Since 2000, the company has acquired about 30 new businesses, which have helped broaden its product offerings. In 2002, it expanded its decision analytics business with the acquisition of AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm.[5] In 2004, it entered the healthcare market by acquiring several businesses, through which it offers analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations, and self-insured employers. In 2006, the company expanded in the insurance claims sector with the acquisition of Xactware, a provider of estimating software for building repair and construction.[6] In 2010, Verisk acquired 3E Company, a provider of services that help customers comply with government-mandated environmental health and safety requirements.[7]
In 2012, Verisk acquired Argus Information & Advisory Services, a provider of information, competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions and regulators in North America, Latin America, and Europe.[8][9] Also in 2012, Verisk acquired Aspect Loss Prevention, a provider of loss prevention software and analytic solutions to the retail, entertainment, and food industries;[10][11] and MediConnect Global, Inc., a provider of proprietary systems and services that facilitate the aggregation and analysis of medical records.[12]
In 2014, Verisk acquired Maplecroft.Net Limited, a provider of global risk analytics and advisory services,[13][14] and Dart, a provider of benchmarking and advisory solutions to financial services institutions in Australia, New Zealand, and other key Asia-Pacific markets.[15]
In 2015, Verisk acquired Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data analytics and commercial intelligence for the energy, chemicals, metals, and mining verticals, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion.[16]

(Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading data analytics provider, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire G2 Web Services (based in Bellevue, Washington), an industry-leading provider of merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers, commercial banks, and other payment system providers. 
G2 Web Services will become part of Argus, a Verisk Analytics business, which will allow Argus to enhance its offerings to clients and partners, providing unprecedented market-leading solutions in merchant and consumer fraud and reputational risk detection.
G2 provides acquiring banks, payment companies, and commercial banks the solutions they need to identify, mitigate, and monitor payments risk in their merchant and business customer portfolios. G2 Web Services has gathered more than a decade of merchant-specific data, which is incorporated in the G2 Merchant Map, the industry's most extensive fraud and compliance database. Combining data science, industry-leading technology, and deep domain expertise, the company leads the payments industry in the identification of third-party merchant risk for hundreds of the world's largest financial institutions.

"By joining with Argus, we will take our proprietary data assets, powerful technology, and deep domain expertise to the next level in helping clients fight fraud, transaction laundering, and reputational risk within the global payments and e-commerce ecosystem," said Allison Guidette, chief executive officer at G2 Web Services. "Together we will expand our capabilities to map bad-actor networks, predict payments risk, and provide clients with the best opportunity to reduce losses and fines due to merchant and business fraud and compliance violations."
"G2 is an excellent fit for the Verisk Analytics family of businesses and a great opportunity to add a unique data set that will allow us to do even more to help our customers combat fraud in the payments space," added Scott Stephenson, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Verisk Analytics.
The purchase price is $112 million, to be paid in cash to stockholders of G2. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2017, subject to the completion of customary closing conditions.

Verisk Analytics


Verisk Analytics, Inc. is an American data analytics and risk assessment firm based in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, serving customers worldwide in insurance, natural resources, financial services, government, and risk management. The company uses proprietary data sets and industry expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions in fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverages, fire protection, catastrophe and weather risk, data management, and other fields.
The company was privately held until its October 6, 2009, initial public offering, which raised $1.9 billion for several of the large insurance companies that were its primary shareholders, making it the largest IPO in the United States for the year 2009.[2] The firm did not raise any funds for itself in the IPO, which was designed to provide an opportunity for the firm's casualty and property insurer owners to sell some or all of their holdings and to provide a market price for those retaining their shares. The 2009 IPO was priced at $22 per share for 85.25 million shares owned by its shareholders, including American International Group, The Hartford and Travelers, making it the largest since the 2008 IPO for Visa Inc. In an action described by investment research company Morningstar as a "vote of confidence" in Verisk, Berkshire Hathaway was the only company among the firm's largest shareholders that did not sell any of its stock in the October 2009 IPO.[3]
History[edit]
The company’s Insurance Services Office (ISO) subsidiary was created in 1971 through the consolidation of various state, regional, and national rating bureaus for various lines of property/casualty insurance.[1] ISO helps insurers with product development, underwriting, and rating. In 2008, Verisk Analytics was established to serve as the parent holding company of ISO. In 2009, Verisk completed its IPO and became a publicly traded company.[4]
Since 2000, the company has acquired about 30 new businesses, which have helped broaden its product offerings. In 2002, it expanded its decision analytics business with the acquisition of AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm.[5] In 2004, it entered the healthcare market by acquiring several businesses, through which it offers analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations, and self-insured employers. In 2006, the company expanded in the insurance claims sector with the acquisition of Xactware, a provider of estimating software for building repair and construction.[6] In 2010, Verisk acquired 3E Company, a provider of services that help customers comply with government-mandated environmental health and safety requirements.[7]
In 2012, Verisk acquired Argus Information & Advisory Services, a provider of information, competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions and regulators in North America, Latin America, and Europe.[8][9] Also in 2012, Verisk acquired Aspect Loss Prevention, a provider of loss prevention software and analytic solutions to the retail, entertainment, and food industries;[10][11] and MediConnect Global, Inc., a provider of proprietary systems and services that facilitate the aggregation and analysis of medical records.[12]
In 2014, Verisk acquired Maplecroft.Net Limited, a provider of global risk analytics and advisory services,[13][14] and Dart, a provider of benchmarking and advisory solutions to financial services institutions in Australia, New Zealand, and other key Asia-Pacific markets.[15]
In 2015, Verisk acquired Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data analytics and commercial intelligence for the energy, chemicals, metals, and mining verticals, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion.[16]

The New #22 Most Shorted Nasdaq 100 Component: Verisk Analytics






Verisk Analytics Becomes #46 Most Shorted Nasdaq 100 Component, Replacing Vertex Pharmaceuticals













Short Interest Moves 12.7% Lower For VRSK
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 02/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 459,107 share decrease in total short interest for Verisk Analytics Inc , to 3,166,530, a decrease of 12.66% since 02/15/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

The most recent short interest data has been released for the 12/30/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the Nasdaq 100 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.
