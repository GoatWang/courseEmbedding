What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!

planned to be conducted.

marks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information,
proprietary rights and processes of any other person or entity.  The Company
is not aware of any impropriety with regard to the granting of any licenses
of Proprietary Information to the Company.  The Company has not received any
written or other communications alleging that the Company has violated or
infringed or that the Company would, by conducting its business as proposed,
violate or infringe any of the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade
names, copyrights or trade secrets or other proprietary rights of any other
person or entity.  No claim is pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
threatened to the effect that any such Proprietary Information owned or
licensed by the Company, or which the Company has the right to use, is
invalid or unenforceable by the company, and, to the Company's knowledge,
there is no basis for any such claim.  Except





pursuant to the terms of the Proprietary Information and Inventions
Agreements entered into between the Company and each of its employees and/or
consultants (the "Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement"), there
are no agreements, understandings, instruments, or contracts to which the
Company is a party or by which it is bound that involve the license of any
patent, copyright, trade secret or other similar proprietary right to or from
the Company.


2.15   TAX RETURNS.  The Company has accurately prepared and timely
filed all federal, state and other tax returns which are required to be filed
and has timely paid all taxes covered by such returns which have become due
and payable.


The Company has not been advised that any of its returns, federal, state or
other, have been or are being audited as of the date hereof.  The Company is
not delinquent in taxes or assessments and has no tax deficiency proposed or
assessed and no waiver of the statute of limitations and assessment or
collections.


2.16   NO DEFAULTS.  The Company has, and, to the Company's knowledge,
each other party thereto has in all material respects, performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it to date and is not in default
under any of the contracts, loans, notes, mortgages, indentures, licenses,
security agreements, agreements, leases, documents, commitments or other
arrangements to which it is a party or by which it is otherwise bound, except
for such defaults which in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, and no event or condition has occurred which, with the lapse of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a default.


2.17   AGREEMENTS; ACTION.


(a)    Except for agreements explicitly contemplated by the
Agreements, there are no material agreements, understandings or proposed
transactions between the Company and any of its officers, employees,
directors, affiliates, or any affiliate thereof.


(b)    There are no material agreements, understandings,
instruments, contracts, proposed transactions, judgments, orders, writs or
decrees to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound which may
involve (i) obligations (contingent or otherwise) of, or payments to the
Company in excess of $50,000 individually or $500,000 in the aggregate, or

(ii) provisions restricting or affecting the development, manufacture of
distribution of the Company's products or services.


(c)    The Company has not (i) declared or paid any dividends,
or authorized or made any distribution upon or with respect to any class or
series of its capital stock, (ii) incurred any indebtedness for money
borrowed or any other liabilities individually in excess of $50,000 or, in
the case of indebtedness and/or liabilities individually less than $50,000,
in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate, (iii) made any loans or advances to
any person, other than ordinary advances for travel expenses, or (iv) sold,
exchanged or otherwise disposed of any of its material assets or rights,
other than the sale of its inventory or replacement of equipment in the
ordinary course of business.


(d)    The Company has not engaged in the past three months in
any discussion (i) with any representative of any corporation or corporations
regarding the consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any such
corporation or corporations, (ii) with any





corporation, partnership, association or other business entity or any
individual regarding the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company or a transaction or series of
related transactions in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting
power of the Company is disposed of, or (iii) regarding any other similar
form of acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.


2.18   RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS.  Except as disclosed in the
Offering Memorandum, no employee, officer, or director of the Company or
member of his or her immediate family is indebted to the Company, nor is the
Company indebted (or committed to make loans or extend or guarantee credit)
to any of them, other than with respect to accrued salaries and vacation
payable to employees and officers of the Company.  To the Company's
knowledge, except as disclosed in the Offering Memorandum, none of such
persons has any direct or indirect ownership interest in any firm or
corporation with which the Company is affiliated or with which the Company
has a business relationship, or any firm or corporation that competes with
the Company, except that employees, officers, or directors of the Company and
members of their immediate family may own stock in publicly traded companies
that may compete with the Company.  No member of the immediate family of any
officer or director of the Company is directly interested in any material
contract with the Company.


2.19   PERMITS.  The Company has all franchises, permits, licenses and
any similar authority necessary for the conduct of its business as now being
conducted by it, the lack of which would materially and adversely affect the
business, properties, prospects or financial condition of the Company and
believes it can obtain, without undue burden or expense, any similar
authority for the conduct of its business as planned to be conducted.  The
Company is not in default in any material respect under any of such
franchises, permits, licenses, or other similar authority.


2.20   ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY LAWS.  To the best of its knowledge,
the Company is not in violation of any applicable statute, law, or regulation
relating to the environment or occupational health and safety, and to the
best of its knowledge, no material expenditures are or will be required in
order to comply with any such existing statute, law, or regulation.


2.21   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS; EMPLOYEES.  The Company does not have
any Employee Benefit Plan as defined in the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  The Company does not have any knowledge as
to any intentions of any key employee or any group of employees to leave the
employ of the Company. The Company has complied in all material respects with
all applicable laws relating to the employment of labor, including provisions
relating to wages, hours, equal opportunity, collective bargaining and the
payment of social security and other taxes and ERISA.


2.22   INSURANCE.  The Company holds valid policies covering insurance
in the amounts and type that the Company reasonably believes is appropriate
and customary for companies in the same or similar businesses to that of the
Company or otherwise required to be maintained by it.





2.23   USE OF PROCEEDS.  The Company will use the proceeds from the
sale of the Shares for the purposes set forth in the Offering Memorandum.


2.24   MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RIGHTS.  The Company has not
granted rights to manufacture, produce, assemble, license, market or sell its
products to any other person and is not bound by any agreement that affects
the Company's exclusive right to develop, manufacture, assemble, distribute,
market or sell it products.


2.25   DISCLOSURE.  The Company has fully provided each Purchaser with
all of the information which such purchaser has requested for deciding
whether to purchase the Shares.  Neither the Agreements nor any other
statements or certificates made or delivered in connection herewith or
therewith contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements herein or therein not
misleading, except that with respect to the financial projections and
forecasts delivered to such Purchaser the Company represents only that such
projection and forecasts were prepared in good faith and on what the Company
believes is a reasonable basis.


2.26   OFFERING MEMORANDUM.  Nothing has come to the attention of the
Company that would cause it to believe that the Offering Memorandum contained
or contains a false or misleading statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the
Offering Memorandum, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.  There is no fact known to the Company which is not in
the Offering Memorandum and which materially and adversely affects the
assets, properties, liabilities, business, affairs, results of operations,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company.


SECTION 3



INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS



Each Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company as
follows:


3.1    EXPERIENCE.  Such Purchaser (other than Purchasers who are
executive officers or directors of the Company, if applicable) has knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of Purchaser's prospective investment in the
Shares.


3.2    INVESTMENT.  Such Purchaser is acquiring the Shares (and any
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Shares) for investment for its
own account and not with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof.  Such Purchaser understands that the Shares (and any
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Shares) to be purchased will not
be registered under the Securities Act on the grounds that the offering and
sale of securities contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from
registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and that the
Company's reliance upon such exemption is predicated upon such Purchaser's
representations set forth in this Agreement.





3.3    RULE 144.  Such Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares must be
held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or
an exemption from such registration is available.  Such Purchaser is aware of
the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permits
limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among other things the
existence of a public market for the shares, the availability of certain
current public information about the Company, the resale occurring not less
than one year after a party has purchased and paid for the securities to be
sold, the sale being through a "broker's transaction" or in transactions
directly with a "market maker" (as provided by Rule 144(f)) and the number of
shares being sold during any three-month period not exceeding specified
limitations.  Such Purchaser is aware that the conditions for resale set
forth in Rule 144 have not been satisfied and that the Company has no plan to
satisfy these conditions in the foreseeable future.


3.4    ADEQUATE INFORMATION; NO PUBLIC MARKET.  Such Purchaser
represents that:  (i) such Purchaser has received all the information it has
requested from the Company and considers necessary or appropriate for
deciding whether to purchase the Shares; (ii) such Purchaser has the ability
to bear the economic risks of such Purchaser's prospective investment; (iii)
such Purchaser understands that no public market currently exists for any of
the Company's securities, and that the Company has made no assurances that a
public market will ever exist for the Shares and (iv) such Purchaser is able,
without materially impairing its financial condition, to hold the Shares for
an indefinite period of time and to suffer complete loss of its investment.


SECTION 4

and attorneys' fees and expenses) to any Purchaser resulting either directly
or indirectly from any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Company contained in the Agreements, or in any
certificate delivered to the Purchasers pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in no event shall the Company be liable for any
amount in excess of the proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the
shares of Series E Preferred.

Stock issued upon conversion thereof, excluding from the determination of

constitute one and the same instrument.


7.14   HEADINGS. The headings of the sections of this Agreement are for

Agreement.
