        NeoStrata brand professional skin care products are recommended by Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeons in over 60 countries, and are exclusively available through physicians.
        
NeoStrata Professional products are uniquely formulated with Alpha hydroxyacids (AHA) and Polyhydroxy acids (PHA) to enhance the therapeutic treatments and skin care recommended by your physician. These patented alpha and polyhydroxy acids are beneficial in improving the visible signs of aging or sun damaged skin and for the treatment of various dermatological conditions including acne, dry skin, hyperkeratoses and hyperpigmentation. NeoStrata offers a range of products for the face and body with various concentrations of AHA and PHA ingredients as well as combinations with sunscreens (SPF), lightening, or anti-acne agents so that the appropriate therapy can be matched to any skin type or condition.
NeoStrata products are dermatologist and allergy tested, fragrance free, dye free, packaged in recyclable containers and are not tested on animals. Most NeoStrata products are proven to be non-comedogenic and non-acnegenic, and the NeoStrata PHA (polyhydroxy acid) formulations are hypoallergenic.

Kinerase®
Kinerase is a line of moisturizing cosmetic products designed to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, freckles, brown spots and uneven pigmentation. Kinerase is useful for day-to-day improvement of skin texture and appearance, for treating skin disorders such as rosacea, eczema and dermatitis, and for post-procedure skin care. Products are non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic, meaning they will not clog pores or cause an allergic reaction.


NIA24® Skin Therapy
NIA24 Skin products are designed to effectively prevent and repair sun damage through a wide range of cleansers, scrubs, sunscreen and strengthening and recovery complexes. These products release Niacin (vitamin B) continuously into the skin to build natural barriers that effectively protect against sun damage. Any current signs of sun damage are significantly reversed, resulting in skin that is rejuvenated, younger and stronger than ever!
NIA24 products are ideal for any patients with early signs of aging who want to reverse these effects before they become more prominent. Patients undergoing serious skin care procedures can benefit from the strengthening powers of these products as well. This advanced line of products noticeably improves skin texture, wrinkles, sun damage and the overall appearance of the skin.


MD SolarSciences®
MD SolarSciences® is an advanced line of sunscreen products that provides broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection for patients of all ages. Products are available as a body spray, mineral gel, lotion or solid stick, and are all fragrance-free and safe for sensitive skin. When using, MD SolarSciences products dry quickly and give skin a silky feel without clogging pores so you and your family can be comfortable and well-protected while in the sun. MD SolarSciences also offers UPF 50+ protective clothing for extended sun protection for all of your needs.


Anthelios®
Produced by La Roche-Posay, Anthelios® is a protective line of mineral sunscreen products with the unique Cell-Ox Shield™, a patent-pending technology that provides outstanding UV protection and antioxidant protection to defend the skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays as well as cellular damage. A wide range of different products are available for daily use, when at the beach, for playing sports and for sensitive skin and children. These products are fast-absorbing and are considered a leader in high UVA protection. Anthelios is also an elegant moisturizer. It is a great make-up base and is easy to incorporate into a daily routine for year round sun protection.
 

bioCorneum®
BioCorneum is an incredibly advanced skin product designed  to minimize the signs of a scar.  Its  silicone-based formulation can also protect scars from further damage or  discoloration resulting from sun exposure.   BioCorneum is effective in flattening and smoothing scar tissue, improving  the cosmetic appearance of both new and older scars.
Typically applied twice a day or as directed by your  physician, BioCorneum is most successful when used consistently for several  months.  The silicone, though invisible  to the eye, acts like a shield to safeguard both the sensitive scar tissue as  well as nearby skin.  The product  provides much-needed hydration and promotes collagen formation in the  area.  BioCorneum also contains ingredients  that can relieve the redness, itchiness and discomfort caused by some scars.
 
Elta MD® Skin Care
Manufactured by Swiss-American Products, Inc., Elta® skincare products can be used to enhance and maintain the overall health and appearance of the skin, as well as to treat conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, incontinence and more. Products such as wound care dressings, moisturizers and sun blocks are specially designed to smooth, heal and protect the skin and can be used on a daily basis.
The philosophy behind these advanced products is that by incorporating medically-approved products into a daily skin regimen, patients can protect themselves against a wide range of skin conditions.
Elta also offers a line of wound therapy products to ensure a proper and speedy recovery from a variety of wounds by facilitating the skin’s natural healing process. These products help maintain a moist environment while keeping the wound clean.
 
Revision® Skincare
Revision Skincare offers the most effective products  available today to enhance the appearance of your skin.  Created to combat the signs of aging, the  entire Revision Skincare line is made from top quality, highly beneficial ingredients.  Each product was designed with a singular  purpose of improving the skin and has been rigorously tested and clinically  proven as a targeted solution.   Cleansers, toners, moisturizers, exfoliators and more work together to  help you maximize your skin’s full potential and look your best for years to  come.

About Us


U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS is funded primarily by immigration and naturalization benefit fees charged to applicants and petitioners. Fees collected from individuals or organizations filing immigration benefit requests are deposited into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account (IEFA). Congress created the IEFA in 1988, establishing the authority to recover the full cost of immigration benefit processing. This account represents approximately 95 percent of USCIS’ fiscal year (FY) 2016 total budget authority. The remaining budget authority comes from two other mandatory fee accounts and appropriated funding for the E-Verify program.The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires that USCIS conduct biennial fee reviews for the IEFA. USCIS last adjusted its fees in November 2010. Results of the FY 2016/2017 fee review indicated that fees should be adjusted by a weighted average increase of 21 percent to ensure full cost recovery. These include the costs associated with fraud detection and national security; customer service and case processing; and providing services without charge to refugee and asylum applicants and to other customers eligible for fee waivers or exemptions.The new fees, including a reduced naturalization fee option for certain low income applicants, took effect on December 23, 2016. Here is a list of the changes.  Filing fees increased for most forms, and we published updated versions of the forms at uscis.gov/forms. We strongly encourage customers to download and submit these new versions, which are updated with the new fees and have an edition date of 12/23/16. We will accept prior versions of forms, with the exception of Form N-400, until February 21, 2017. However, all filings postmarked 12/23/16 or later must include the new fees or we will reject them.The new fee schedule accounts for limited strategic investments, including targeted enhancements for refining and improving the delivery, security and integrity of the EB-5 visa program. The new fee schedule assumes no discretionary appropriations for Refugee, Asylum and International Operations; Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE); or the Office of Citizenship, including the Citizenship and Integration Grant program.   Mission StatementUSCIS will secure America’s promise as a nation of immigrants by providing accurate and useful information to our customers, granting immigration and citizenship benefits, promoting an awareness and understanding of citizenship, and ensuring the integrity of our immigration system.We are the 19,000 government employees and contractors of USCIS working at 223 offices across the world. Achieving our goals becomes possible when the different elements of our organization are engaged and acting as partners working toward a common outcome. USCIS’ strategic goals include:Strengthening the security and integrity of the immigration system.Providing effective customer-oriented immigration benefit and information services.Supporting immigrants’ integration and participation in American civic culture.Promoting flexible and sound immigration policies and programs.Strengthening the infrastructure supporting the USCIS mission.Operating as a high-performance organization that promotes a highly talented workforce and a dynamic work culture.Core ValuesIntegrityWe will always strive for the highest level of integrity in our dealings with our customers, our fellow employees, and the citizens of the United States of America. We review each case before us on its own merit and reach decisions that are based on the law and facts. We will be ever mindful of the importance of the trust the American people have placed in us to administer the nation’s immigration system fairly, honestly, and correctly.RespectWe will demonstrate respect in all of our actions. We will ensure that everyone we affect will be treated with dignity and courtesy regardless of the outcome of their case. We will model this principle in all of our activities with each other, our customers, and the public. Through our actions, USCIS will become known as an example of respect, dignity, and courtesy.InnovationAs we meet the challenges to come, we will strive to find the most effective means to accomplish our goals. We will use innovation, resourcefulness, creativity, and sound management principles to strive for world-class results. We will approach every challenge with a balance of enthusiasm and wisdom in our effort to fulfill our vision.VigilanceIn this era of increased global threats and security challenges, we will remain mindful of our obligation to provide immigration services in a manner that strengthens and enhances our nation’s security. We will exercise vigilance as we perform our mission. We will carefully administer every aspect of our work to uphold the security and integrity of the immigration system so that new immigrants and the public can hold in high regard the privileges and advantages of lawful presence in the United States.For more information on the history of our organization, see the Our History page.This page can be found at http://www.uscis.gov/aboutus

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive.

Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Schwartz's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Schwartz is Board Certified in:Plastic SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Plastic Surgery ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
