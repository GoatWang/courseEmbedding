About




HydraForce was founded in 1985, just north of Chicago by several partners who had the foresight to identify the mobile equipment industry's need for high quality hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds. Today, we've grown to several manufacturing locations in North America, Europe and Asia, featuring a worldwide network of 120 stocking distributors who can provide our customers with all the local support they need.
Our Story
The HydraForce story began in 1985 when the company was founded near Chicago by several partners who saw the mobile equipment industry’s need for quality hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds delivered in a timely and responsive manner. They also saw the potential for engineering innovation and design flexibility offered by cost effective and space-saving cartridge valves and hydraulic integrated circuits.  Since its founding, HydraForce continues to be a privately held company as it has grown to several manufacturing locations in North America, Europe and Asia, with a network of 120 stocking distributors who can offer local support across the globe.  To maintain our core competency of speed to market, HydraForce has invested in application technical support tools including i-Design, our free hydraulic system design software, which integrates seamlessly with 3rd party simulation software, monthly webinars on new products and application tips, and an online product catalog.  All HydraForce products carry a five-year limited warranty against defects in material and workmanship.  
HydraForce Cartridge Valves, Custom Manifolds and Electro-Hydraulic Controls
HydraForce offers one of the most comprehensive lines of high quality hydraulic cartridge valves for the mobile and industrial equipment markets. We design and manufacture high performance valves that meet virtually any need encountered in machine design for flow rates of 0.4 to 530 lpm (0.1 to 140 gpm). HydraForce cartridge valves are designed to fit a wide range of industry-common valve cavities. Cavity thread sizes and complete cavity specifications are provided in our technical reference section.
Our custom manifolds offer no-leak, screw-in componentry, fast and easy valve removal and replacement, and reduced plumbing when compared to traditional hydraulic systems. We also offer a robust line of controllers that are rugged, reliable, and optimized for electro-hydraulic system integration.
Innovative, Robust, and Customizable Designs
Custom is our specialty, if you don’t see what you need on the site, reach out to your HydraForce representative or one of a hundred local distributors to discuss your custom needs.  Our "group technology" approach to product planning, design, and manufacturing allows us to use a few basic parts to create many different models. Product availability is enhanced by this cost-effective engineering approach.
Flexible Delivery
Flexibility is one of the cornerstones of our operation and your dedication to quality and flexibility ensures you’ll get your HydraForce hydraulic control system quickly. Our Just In Time production methodology provides the capacity to meet the most demanding customer requirements in less time than it takes most manufacturers to pull and ship material from their finished goods inventory.  No matter where you are in the world, we expedite your order to your facility so you get what you need, when you need it, and most importantly, when it’s promised.

About




HydraForce was founded in 1985, just north of Chicago by several partners who had the foresight to identify the mobile equipment industry's need for high quality hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds. Today, we've grown to several manufacturing locations in North America, Europe and Asia, featuring a worldwide network of 120 stocking distributors who can provide our customers with all the local support they need.
Our Story
The HydraForce story began in 1985 when the company was founded near Chicago by several partners who saw the mobile equipment industry’s need for quality hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds delivered in a timely and responsive manner. They also saw the potential for engineering innovation and design flexibility offered by cost effective and space-saving cartridge valves and hydraulic integrated circuits.  Since its founding, HydraForce continues to be a privately held company as it has grown to several manufacturing locations in North America, Europe and Asia, with a network of 120 stocking distributors who can offer local support across the globe.  To maintain our core competency of speed to market, HydraForce has invested in application technical support tools including i-Design, our free hydraulic system design software, which integrates seamlessly with 3rd party simulation software, monthly webinars on new products and application tips, and an online product catalog.  All HydraForce products carry a five-year limited warranty against defects in material and workmanship.  
HydraForce Cartridge Valves, Custom Manifolds and Electro-Hydraulic Controls
HydraForce offers one of the most comprehensive lines of high quality hydraulic cartridge valves for the mobile and industrial equipment markets. We design and manufacture high performance valves that meet virtually any need encountered in machine design for flow rates of 0.4 to 530 lpm (0.1 to 140 gpm). HydraForce cartridge valves are designed to fit a wide range of industry-common valve cavities. Cavity thread sizes and complete cavity specifications are provided in our technical reference section.
Our custom manifolds offer no-leak, screw-in componentry, fast and easy valve removal and replacement, and reduced plumbing when compared to traditional hydraulic systems. We also offer a robust line of controllers that are rugged, reliable, and optimized for electro-hydraulic system integration.
Innovative, Robust, and Customizable Designs
Custom is our specialty, if you don’t see what you need on the site, reach out to your HydraForce representative or one of a hundred local distributors to discuss your custom needs.  Our "group technology" approach to product planning, design, and manufacturing allows us to use a few basic parts to create many different models. Product availability is enhanced by this cost-effective engineering approach.
Flexible Delivery
Flexibility is one of the cornerstones of our operation and your dedication to quality and flexibility ensures you’ll get your HydraForce hydraulic control system quickly. Our Just In Time production methodology provides the capacity to meet the most demanding customer requirements in less time than it takes most manufacturers to pull and ship material from their finished goods inventory.  No matter where you are in the world, we expedite your order to your facility so you get what you need, when you need it, and most importantly, when it’s promised.

Company Description by HydraForce, Inc.
HydraForce offers one of the most comprehensive lines of high quality hydraulic cartridge valves for the mobile and industrial equipment markets. We are designing high performance valves to meet virtually any need encountered in machine design for flow rates of 0.4 to 300 lpm (0.1 to 80 gpm). 

Our "group technology" approach to product planning, design, and manufacturing allows us to use a few basic parts to create many different models. Product availability is enhanced by this cost-effective engineering approach.

The key to high quality final products is in maintaining precise control of those operations which produce the fits and clearances in critical valve subassemblies. State-of-the-art preparation and assembly equipment enables us to meet critical tolerances for more efficient hydraulic circuits.

Technical Reference Info.












Multi-Function Valves.
HydraForce multifunction valves incorporate two or more functions into a single valve, allowing for the design of a
lighter, more compact valve package. Multifunction valves reduce manifold size, number of ports, and machining costs,
while increasing flow passage efficiency. The result is more responsive machine performance and efficient use of
available horsepower.








Solenoid On/Off Valves
For on/off control of hydraulic flow rates up to 300 lpm (80 gpm) and pressures up to 345 bar (5000 psi) continuous and 420 bar (6090 psi) intermittently. Choose from poppet or spool type, normally open or closed, two-, three-, four-way, four-way three-position, five-way three position or six way configurations. Tandem center, open center, closed center or motor spool. Blocking/low flow. Manual override options. Standard (SV series) and high pressure models (HyPerformance™ HSV and SF series).









Directional Valves
For directional control of hydraulic flows up to 280 lpm (74 gpm) and pressures up to 345 bar (5000 psi) continuous and 420 bar (6090 psi) intermittently. Choose from check valves for blocking or load-holding, pilot-operated valves for remote actuation, logic elements for multi-function applications, manual spring-return or pressure actuated, lock valves, shuttle valves, spool-type and poppet-type. Manual rotary valve handles and knob kits available.








Custom Manifolds
Consolidate and optimize hydraulic functions with a custom hydraulic manifold (also called Hydraulic Integrated Circuits or HICs). Steel, aluminum, cast or ductile iron blocks. Anodized or zinc plating for severe environments. FastTrak” service for quick delivery of prototypes. i-Design software available for circuit configuration free of charge.








Electro-Proportional Valves
For proportional control of hydraulic flow or pressure to cylinders or motors for flow rates up to 150 lpm (80 gpm) and pressures up to 345 bar (5000 psi) continuous and 420 bar (6090 psi) intermittently. Choose from flow control (PV and ZL series); pressure control (TS series); directional and flow control (SP series) and multi-function directional control (SPCL, HSPEC) with built-in load-sensing and flow compensation. Manual override options. Standard and high pressure models (HyPerformance™ HPV, HSP series).








Flow Control Valves
For flow control (FC series) and pressure compensation of hydraulic flows up to 530 lpm (140 gpm) and pressures up to 345 bar (5000 psi) continuous and 420 bar (6090 psi) intermittently. Reverse flow check, needle valves (NV series), pressure compensated flow regulators (FR series), compensating elements (EC series), manual rotary valves (MR series) and flow divider/combiner valves (FD series). Variable or fixed orifice restrictor valves. Optional spring ranges. Standard and high pressure (HyPerformance™ HEC series).








Valve Housings and Accessories
Aluminum, ductile iron and steel housings, in sizes 08, 09, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 42. Spacer plates, 2 by 2 blocks, cavity plugs, orifice and check valve discs, manifold accessories, cavity form tools, valve seal kits, hand pumps, and i-Design software.








Electronic Coils and Valve Position Sensor Options
Solenoid coils for standard or severe duty, environmentally-hardened E-coils, integral position sensing, dual sensor output options.








Pressure Control Valves
Pressure control and relief of hydraulic systems for flows up to 303 lpm (80 gpm) and pressures up to 420 bar (6090 psi). RV Series direct-acting or pilot operated option. Bi-directional (CR series) and thermal relief (TR series) valves. Motion control valves (CB series) Sequence valves (PS series). Pressure-reducing valves (PR series).Pressure reducing logic elements (ER series). Kick-down valves (KS series). Unloading valves (UP series). Pressure adjustment, anti-cavitation and PED-certified models available.








Electronic Vehicle Controls
Off-highway machine programmable controllers and machine control systems including Coretek™ brand controllers for 20, 39 or 52 inputs and 20, 24, or 28 outputs, CoDeSys™ Controlled Development Systems software, Backbone™ configuration tool, Impulse™ service tool.  EVDR Programmable valve drivers. Wachendorff display units. Heavy-duty pressure sensors.








D03 (NG6) Sandwich Valves
Solenoid, directional, flow and pressure control valves are available for use with subplate-type valves in the ISO, CETOP and NFPA standard format.
