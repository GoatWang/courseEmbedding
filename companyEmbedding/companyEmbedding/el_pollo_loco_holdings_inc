El Pollo Loco
Stevens Creek Blvd and Loma Linda Dr 
 El Pollo Loco is a Mexican restaurant concept located at 5124 Stevens Creek Blvd Suite A in San Jose, CA. We’re dedicated to serving authentic fire-grilled chicken and Mexican food to the San Jose community. Throughout every day we slowly marinate and fire-grill whole chickens in a special recipe of herbs, spices, fruit juices and garlic to create a tender, juicy and flavorful chicken that we hand chop and serve in our chicken meals, burritos, salads, tostadas, tacos and quesadillas. And if that’s not enough, we apply that same passion to our handmade guacamole, salsas and dressings every day.

El Pollo Loco
W El Camino Real and Mary Ave 
 El Pollo Loco is a Mexican restaurant concept located at 996 W El Camino Real  in Sunnyvale, CA. We’re dedicated to serving authentic fire-grilled chicken and Mexican food to the Sunnyvale community. Throughout every day we slowly marinate and fire-grill whole chickens in a special recipe of herbs, spices, fruit juices and garlic to create a tender, juicy and flavorful chicken that we hand chop and serve in our chicken meals, burritos, salads, tostadas, tacos and quesadillas. And if that’s not enough, we apply that same passion to our handmade guacamole, salsas and dressings every day.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

“I’ve been employed with El Pollo Loco since November 2008 and have enjoyed working here because it’s an opportunity to collaborate and work as a team–it’s fun, engaging and exciting. And aside from our great guests and employees, we serve the tastiest, healthiest and best quality-food options available."
“I also like that El Pollo Loco offers me a flexible work schedule, which has been extremely beneficial as I’m a full-time employee and student. What’s more, I’ve made sure to take advantage of the dental benefit, as I can now say that I have a healthy smile! The vacation hours are also beneficial, being able to take time from my busy schedule and spend it with family or catch up on any school work. And it’s a relief knowing that I receive sick pay and don’t have to worry about having to make up lost hours. Perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects of my job is knowing that after all of our hard team work and challenges, I can receive a bonus!”

James DerksenGeneral ManagerTestimonial
James Derksen describes training at El Pollo Loco…
“El Pollo Loco was a great career choice! I was hired as a manager in training and spent 7 weeks training. I loved my Trainer, Lucinda! She was very helpful and allowed me to learn at my own pace. The training was structured and included great training materials. I attended one week of classroom training and felt it was a good balance with the rest of the training being hands-on in the restaurant. The time in the classroom gave me an opportunity to spend time with my peers and build friendships.”
Since entering our management program in January 2010, James Derksen has risen quickly with the company from Manager in Training, to Assistant Manager, and then to his current position as General Manager. He utilized all that he was taught and has become an asset to his team. The training he received was invaluable; it enabled him to become a successful manager who is well respected.
“I was well prepared for my manager responsibilities and ready to move forward in the company,” says James. “El Pollo Loco has such a great support system, I have so many resources to help me, I can’t fail! We have hands-on training for all of our employees and Shift Leaders, too. If you’re looking for a career with unlimited potential where you’ll get excellent training to help you succeed, El Pollo Loco is the place for you!”

“I did not have medical insurance when my wife gave me the happy surprise that I was going to be a father again! I knew open enrollment for our medical insurance was coming up but my wife needed prenatal care, so we started to pay out of our pocket for her to see a doctor. When it was time for open enrollment, we took advantage of the medical insurance and signed up. The new insurance not only put my wife in a very nice hospital, they were able to reimburse us for all of the money we had spent for prenatal care!” 
Daniel Aleman joined the El Pollo Loco family in 2006 as a general manager in our Las Vegas market. He has managed several different restaurant locations throughout his time with us. Daniel has become a strong believer and an advocate for benefits. He has since taken advantage of other benefits including dental and vision insurance.
“My oldest daughter has been getting orthodontic work done and the insurance has saved me a lot of money,” says Daniel. “But for me,” Daniel says, “I use the vision insurance and enjoy the low-cost exams and new glasses. I also use our Employee Assistance Program and get advice on what to eat, how to exercise and how to stay healthy. I am very happy that El Pollo Loco offers such great benefits!”

El Pollo Loco, Inc. is a restaurant chain based in the United States, specializing in Mexican-style grilled chicken. Restaurant service consists of: dine-in, take-out, with some locations offering drive through options. The company is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California and operates over 400 (as of March 2014) company-owned and franchised restaurants in the Southwestern United States. "El Pollo Loco" is Spanish for "The Crazy Chicken".
Fare[edit]




A typical El Pollo Loco restaurant


El Pollo Loco primarily prepares Mexican chicken entrees. The company describes its chicken as "citrus-marinated and fire-grilled." The American company also offer Mexican-style food such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.[2]
In a bid to compete with companies such as KFC and Chick-fil-A, El Pollo Loco experimented with offering deep fried chicken in the form of breaded chicken tenders at selected locations in the United States for a limited time during the Fall 2016.[3][4] This experiment is a big departure from its previous marketing campaigns that tout their fired-grilled chicken as a healthy alternative to fried chicken.
History[edit]
Juan Francisco Ochoa started the restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1975.[5]
By 1979 the chain had expanded throughout northern Mexico. On December 8, 1980, Ochoa opened first U.S. restaurant opened in Los Angeles, California at 503 Alvarado Street, near Sixth Street.[6][7] The first American location was only 1,500-square-feet and it grossed more than $125,000 per month during its first year of operation.[8] The initial menu was very simple: a choice of a half or whole chicken with a packet of warm tortillas and a cup of salsa.[8] A second location was opened in Santa Ana in the fall of 1981.[8]
In 1983, the 19 American restaurants in the chain were acquired by Denny's with an agreement that the Ochoa family would continue to operate the restaurants in Mexico.[9] After 18 months of new ownership, the American owned El Loco Pollo, Inc. had increased the number of locations in Southern California from 19 to 29 while adding 6 locations in distant Houston, Texas, with almost all of the new locations were franchise operations.[10]
Four years later the 70-unit El Pollo Loco was acquired by TW Services when TW Services purchased El Pollo Loco's then parent Denny's Inc. in 1987 for $218 million in cash.[11][12]
In May 1990 El Pollo Loco opened its 200th restaurant in Yorba Linda.[13] During the early 1990s the company experimented with many different concepts to increase marketshare in the competitive Southern Californian fast food industry. In 1994 the company test marketed at a select few locations: a side-dish bar, salsa bar, and barbecue at some locations, while other locations tried selling french fries or ice cream.[14] Only salsa bars survived the test and were introduced chainwide the following year.[15] The company also tested home delivery and catering in 1995.[15]
In August 1995 El Pollo Loco earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for building the world's largest burrito in Anaheim, California. The burrito was 3,112 feet (949 m) long and weighed two tons.[16]
American Securities Capital Partners acquired the 274-location El Pollo Loco in 1999 for $114 Million[17] and sold it to Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005 for $400 Million with 328 locations.[18][19]
In January 2007, El Pollo Loco was featured on NBC TV's hit show The Apprentice: Los Angeles where contestants competed by creating and selling versions of El Pollo Loco's Pollo Bowl.[20] El Pollo Loco was recognized by the World Franchising Network as a Top Franchise for Hispanics in 2010.[21]
New locations were first open by franchisees in the states of Utah[22] and Oregon[23] in 2008. The 400th location was opened in Chelsea, Massachusetts in May 2008.[24]
In July 2014, El Loco Pollo (NASDAQ: LOCO) became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ.[25][26]
Temporary expansion eastward[edit]
Throughout its history, El Pollo Loco, Inc., tried at various times to expand beyond its core territories of California and the American Southwest, but all of these attempts were so far not very successful.
In 1987, then owner TW Services began to open restaurants in the Orlando area, starting in Winter Park, Florida.[27] Five restaurants were eventually built but all five were forced to close in 1991.[28]
A second expansion attempt, mainly though franchises, was started in 2006 under then owner Trimaran Capital Partners.[29][30][31] All of these locations were closed within six years.
During this time, El Pollo Loco or its franchisees briefly operated several restaurants in metro Atlanta,[32] and Boston,[24][33] New Jersey[34] and in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia;[35] these closed by 2011. The chain's franchised restaurants in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area[23][36] also closed in 2011. An El Pollo Loco in the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut[37] closed in spring 2012. The last of four Chicago area[38][39][40] stores closed at the end of 2012.
Locations within the United States[edit]
In the U.S., the El Pollo Loco chain operates over 400 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, and California. In 2012, El Pollo Loco restaurants went through a major makeover.[41]
Locations outside of North America[edit]
Under Denny's and its successors, El Pollo Loco, Inc., had sold franchise licenses to operators based in East Asia. By 1997, EPL, Inc., had franchises located in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.[42] The franchise licenses for both Malaysia and Singapore has since lapsed. In July 2016, the Delgado family, owners of the El Pollo Loco franchise in the Philippines, filed a lawsuit against EPL, Inc. in the Regional Trial Court so it could retain the El Pollo Loco trademark in that country after the franchise contract had terminated.[43]
Charity partners[edit]
The brand created Fire-Grilled Fundraisers, an initiative for nonprofit organizations to raise funds for their cause while dining at the restaurant. They also created El Pollo Loco Charities, a nonprofit 501(c) charity to provide meals to underprivileged families, in 2005.[44]

The El Pollo Loco locations in Mexico are not affiliated with or operated by the Costa Mesa, California-based El Pollo Loco, Inc. but are operated by Mexico-based El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V., which is still owned by founder Juan Francisco Ochoa and his family.[45] The company specializes in selling Sinaloa-style marinaded grilled chicken.
In Mexico, El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V., operates as El Pollo Loco in over 40 locations within Mexico City and the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, Michoacán, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas, of which 32 of those being located in Nuevo León.[46]
History of the Mexican chain[edit]
Ochoa opened his first location in Guasave in the state of Sinaloa on January 6, 1974 at a small roadside location containing ten tables and with a starting working capital of 15 thousand pesos. His wife Flérida created a fruit-based marinade which was used to coat the chicken for several hours prior to grilling. After a few hours of operations on their first day, they sold out all 43 chickens.[45][47][48]
Three years later, Ochoa's brother Jaime quit his job and opened the company's second location in San Luis Potosi. This was quickly followed by other locations that were opened and operated by Ochoa's other brothers and sisters in Guadalajara, Morelia, Monterrey, and Saltillo.[45]
By the end of 1979, Ochoa had 85 restaurants in 20 cities throughout Northern Mexico with many of the locations operated by family members or close friends.[47] At that time, Ochoa thought about expanding north of the borders into areas of the United States that he had previously visited. In 1980, Ochoa opened his first U.S. location on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, an area which had a high concentration of immigrants from Sinaloa.[7][45]
The company rapidly expanded on both sides of the international border during the early 1980s. However a number of bad decisions caused by a non-related manager caused the company to accumulate $3 million in debts and created a cash flow problem that forced Ochoa to sell his properties outside of Mexico to help cover those debts.[45]
In September 1983, Ochoa sold the 19 U.S. locations, all of which were located in Southern California, to Denny's[9][49] for either $12.6 million[50] or $11.3 million.[10] At the time of the sale, Ochoa had retained 92 locations within Mexico.[9] As part of the agreement, Denny's promised to assist Ochoa in opening new locations in the parts of Mexico that Ochoa's company did not then occupy. In 2004, the Mexican company filed suit in U.S. Federal Court against the American company for failure to fulfill the joint expansion agreement. After three years of litigation, the Court ruled against the American company and ordered the American company to pay $22 million in damages and to return the ownership of the "El Pollo Loco" trademark and intellectual property within Mexico back to the Mexican company.[51][52]
As a result of the debt debacle created during the early 1980s by a non-family manager, the number of locations has since shrunk to approximately 40 locations, all of which are managed and operated by family members.[45]
After the sale of the American locations in 1983, Ochoa restricted his business activities to Mexico. However, the lure of new business activities north of the Rio Grande was too hard to resist and Ochoa opened his new business, called Taco Palenque, in Laredo, Texas in 1987.[53]
Menu[edit]
Unlike its American counterpart, the Mexican chain has kept its menu simple and focused on the grilled chicken. Deboned chicken or other animal protein like shrimp or carne asada are not available. Standard Mexican-American fare such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are also not available. The chain does offer french fries (Papas a la Francesa), cole slaw (Ensalada de Col), macaroni salad (Ensalada de Coditos), and charro beans to go with the pieces of grilled chicken.[54]
Controversies[edit]
In January 2016, the Secretaría de Salud de Nuevo León, the Health Ministry for the Mexican state of Nuevo León, closed several franchised locations of El Pollo Loco for several health code violations.[55] At least one of the locations was owned by Mexican politician Marco González who claimed that the closures were politically motivated.[56]

The goal is to finish the job systemwide by 1996. Also, the company might expand a recent experiment in catering and home delivery. The company says the services were so popular during the holidays that the idea might go chainwide. All 31 Orange County locations cater, and one Huntington Beach store has home delivery. The menu, once topheavy with chicken, will get several new items, including fish tacos, mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. Six entrees and five side dishes were added last year, helping to boost the company's sales.  Link via ProQuest.

El Pollo Loco, Inc. is a restaurant chain based in the United States, specializing in Mexican-style grilled chicken. Restaurant service consists of: dine-in, take-out, with some locations offering drive through options. The company is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California and operates over 400 (as of March 2014) company-owned and franchised restaurants in the Southwestern United States. "El Pollo Loco" is Spanish for "The Crazy Chicken".
Fare[edit]




A typical El Pollo Loco restaurant


El Pollo Loco primarily prepares Mexican chicken entrees. The company describes its chicken as "citrus-marinated and fire-grilled." The American company also offer Mexican-style food such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.[2]
In a bid to compete with companies such as KFC and Chick-fil-A, El Pollo Loco experimented with offering deep fried chicken in the form of breaded chicken tenders at selected locations in the United States for a limited time during the Fall 2016.[3][4] This experiment is a big departure from its previous marketing campaigns that tout their fired-grilled chicken as a healthy alternative to fried chicken.
History[edit]
Juan Francisco Ochoa started the restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1975.[5]
By 1979 the chain had expanded throughout northern Mexico. On December 8, 1980, Ochoa opened first U.S. restaurant opened in Los Angeles, California at 503 Alvarado Street, near Sixth Street.[6][7] The first American location was only 1,500-square-feet and it grossed more than $125,000 per month during its first year of operation.[8] The initial menu was very simple: a choice of a half or whole chicken with a packet of warm tortillas and a cup of salsa.[8] A second location was opened in Santa Ana in the fall of 1981.[8]
In 1983, the 19 American restaurants in the chain were acquired by Denny's with an agreement that the Ochoa family would continue to operate the restaurants in Mexico.[9] After 18 months of new ownership, the American owned El Loco Pollo, Inc. had increased the number of locations in Southern California from 19 to 29 while adding 6 locations in distant Houston, Texas, with almost all of the new locations were franchise operations.[10]
Four years later the 70-unit El Pollo Loco was acquired by TW Services when TW Services purchased El Pollo Loco's then parent Denny's Inc. in 1987 for $218 million in cash.[11][12]
In May 1990 El Pollo Loco opened its 200th restaurant in Yorba Linda.[13] During the early 1990s the company experimented with many different concepts to increase marketshare in the competitive Southern Californian fast food industry. In 1994 the company test marketed at a select few locations: a side-dish bar, salsa bar, and barbecue at some locations, while other locations tried selling french fries or ice cream.[14] Only salsa bars survived the test and were introduced chainwide the following year.[15] The company also tested home delivery and catering in 1995.[15]
In August 1995 El Pollo Loco earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for building the world's largest burrito in Anaheim, California. The burrito was 3,112 feet (949 m) long and weighed two tons.[16]
American Securities Capital Partners acquired the 274-location El Pollo Loco in 1999 for $114 Million[17] and sold it to Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005 for $400 Million with 328 locations.[18][19]
In January 2007, El Pollo Loco was featured on NBC TV's hit show The Apprentice: Los Angeles where contestants competed by creating and selling versions of El Pollo Loco's Pollo Bowl.[20] El Pollo Loco was recognized by the World Franchising Network as a Top Franchise for Hispanics in 2010.[21]
New locations were first open by franchisees in the states of Utah[22] and Oregon[23] in 2008. The 400th location was opened in Chelsea, Massachusetts in May 2008.[24]
In July 2014, El Loco Pollo (NASDAQ: LOCO) became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ.[25][26]
Temporary expansion eastward[edit]
Throughout its history, El Pollo Loco, Inc., tried at various times to expand beyond its core territories of California and the American Southwest, but all of these attempts were so far not very successful.
In 1987, then owner TW Services began to open restaurants in the Orlando area, starting in Winter Park, Florida.[27] Five restaurants were eventually built but all five were forced to close in 1991.[28]
A second expansion attempt, mainly though franchises, was started in 2006 under then owner Trimaran Capital Partners.[29][30][31] All of these locations were closed within six years.
During this time, El Pollo Loco or its franchisees briefly operated several restaurants in metro Atlanta,[32] and Boston,[24][33] New Jersey[34] and in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia;[35] these closed by 2011. The chain's franchised restaurants in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area[23][36] also closed in 2011. An El Pollo Loco in the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut[37] closed in spring 2012. The last of four Chicago area[38][39][40] stores closed at the end of 2012.
Locations within the United States[edit]
In the U.S., the El Pollo Loco chain operates over 400 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, and California. In 2012, El Pollo Loco restaurants went through a major makeover.[41]
Locations outside of North America[edit]
Under Denny's and its successors, El Pollo Loco, Inc., had sold franchise licenses to operators based in East Asia. By 1997, EPL, Inc., had franchises located in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.[42] The franchise licenses for both Malaysia and Singapore has since lapsed. In July 2016, the Delgado family, owners of the El Pollo Loco franchise in the Philippines, filed a lawsuit against EPL, Inc. in the Regional Trial Court so it could retain the El Pollo Loco trademark in that country after the franchise contract had terminated.[43]
Charity partners[edit]
The brand created Fire-Grilled Fundraisers, an initiative for nonprofit organizations to raise funds for their cause while dining at the restaurant. They also created El Pollo Loco Charities, a nonprofit 501(c) charity to provide meals to underprivileged families, in 2005.[44]

The El Pollo Loco locations in Mexico are not affiliated with or operated by the Costa Mesa, California-based El Pollo Loco, Inc. but are operated by Mexico-based El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V., which is still owned by founder Juan Francisco Ochoa and his family.[45] The company specializes in selling Sinaloa-style marinaded grilled chicken.
In Mexico, El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V., operates as El Pollo Loco in over 40 locations within Mexico City and the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, Michoacán, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas, of which 32 of those being located in Nuevo León.[46]
History of the Mexican chain[edit]
Ochoa opened his first location in Guasave in the state of Sinaloa on January 6, 1974 at a small roadside location containing ten tables and with a starting working capital of 15 thousand pesos. His wife Flérida created a fruit-based marinade which was used to coat the chicken for several hours prior to grilling. After a few hours of operations on their first day, they sold out all 43 chickens.[45][47][48]
Three years later, Ochoa's brother Jaime quit his job and opened the company's second location in San Luis Potosi. This was quickly followed by other locations that were opened and operated by Ochoa's other brothers and sisters in Guadalajara, Morelia, Monterrey, and Saltillo.[45]
By the end of 1979, Ochoa had 85 restaurants in 20 cities throughout Northern Mexico with many of the locations operated by family members or close friends.[47] At that time, Ochoa thought about expanding north of the borders into areas of the United States that he had previously visited. In 1980, Ochoa opened his first U.S. location on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, an area which had a high concentration of immigrants from Sinaloa.[7][45]
The company rapidly expanded on both sides of the international border during the early 1980s. However a number of bad decisions caused by a non-related manager caused the company to accumulate $3 million in debts and created a cash flow problem that forced Ochoa to sell his properties outside of Mexico to help cover those debts.[45]
In September 1983, Ochoa sold the 19 U.S. locations, all of which were located in Southern California, to Denny's[9][49] for either $12.6 million[50] or $11.3 million.[10] At the time of the sale, Ochoa had retained 92 locations within Mexico.[9] As part of the agreement, Denny's promised to assist Ochoa in opening new locations in the parts of Mexico that Ochoa's company did not then occupy. In 2004, the Mexican company filed suit in U.S. Federal Court against the American company for failure to fulfill the joint expansion agreement. After three years of litigation, the Court ruled against the American company and ordered the American company to pay $22 million in damages and to return the ownership of the "El Pollo Loco" trademark and intellectual property within Mexico back to the Mexican company.[51][52]
As a result of the debt debacle created during the early 1980s by a non-family manager, the number of locations has since shrunk to approximately 40 locations, all of which are managed and operated by family members.[45]
After the sale of the American locations in 1983, Ochoa restricted his business activities to Mexico. However, the lure of new business activities north of the Rio Grande was too hard to resist and Ochoa opened his new business, called Taco Palenque, in Laredo, Texas in 1987.[53]
Menu[edit]
Unlike its American counterpart, the Mexican chain has kept its menu simple and focused on the grilled chicken. Deboned chicken or other animal protein like shrimp or carne asada are not available. Standard Mexican-American fare such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are also not available. The chain does offer french fries (Papas a la Francesa), cole slaw (Ensalada de Col), macaroni salad (Ensalada de Coditos), and charro beans to go with the pieces of grilled chicken.[54]
Controversies[edit]
In January 2016, the Secretaría de Salud de Nuevo León, the Health Ministry for the Mexican state of Nuevo León, closed several franchised locations of El Pollo Loco for several health code violations.[55] At least one of the locations was owned by Mexican politician Marco González who claimed that the closures were politically motivated.[56]

El Pollo Loco executives are currently testing a barbecue concept, as well as a joint operation with a Fosters Freeze store in Upland, Calif., a project that might lead to the introduction of ice creams chainwide.

For starters, $6.6 million will be spent to remodel all 206 El Pollo Loco locations. Changes include an exterior overhaul, installing new lamps and adding salsa bars at every location. The goal is to finish the job systemwide by 1996. Also, the company might expand a recent experiment in catering and home delivery. The company says the services were so popular during the holidays that the idea might go chainwide. All 31 Orange County locations cater, and one Huntington Beach store has home delivery. The menu, once topheavy with chicken, will get several new items, including fish tacos, mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. Six entrees and five side dishes were added last year, helping to boost the company's sales.  Link via ProQuest.

El Pollo Loco, Inc. is a restaurant chain based in the United States, specializing in Mexican-style grilled chicken. Restaurant service consists of: dine-in, take-out, with some locations offering drive through options. The company is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California and operates over 400 (as of March 2014) company-owned and franchised restaurants in the Southwestern United States. "El Pollo Loco" is Spanish for "The Crazy Chicken".
Fare[edit]




A typical El Pollo Loco restaurant


El Pollo Loco primarily prepares Mexican chicken entrees. The company describes its chicken as "citrus-marinated and fire-grilled." The American company also offer Mexican-style food such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.[2]
In a bid to compete with companies such as KFC and Chick-fil-A, El Pollo Loco experimented with offering deep fried chicken in the form of breaded chicken tenders at selected locations in the United States for a limited time during the Fall 2016.[3][4] This experiment is a big departure from its previous marketing campaigns that tout their fired-grilled chicken as a healthy alternative to fried chicken.
History[edit]
Juan Francisco Ochoa started the restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1975.[5]
By 1979 the chain had expanded throughout northern Mexico. On December 8, 1980, Ochoa opened first U.S. restaurant opened in Los Angeles, California at 503 Alvarado Street, near Sixth Street.[6][7] The first American location was only 1,500-square-feet and it grossed more than $125,000 per month during its first year of operation.[8] The initial menu was very simple: a choice of a half or whole chicken with a packet of warm tortillas and a cup of salsa.[8] A second location was opened in Santa Ana in the fall of 1981.[8]
In 1983, the 19 American restaurants in the chain were acquired by Denny's with an agreement that the Ochoa family would continue to operate the restaurants in Mexico.[9] After 18 months of new ownership, the American owned El Loco Pollo, Inc. had increased the number of locations in Southern California from 19 to 29 while adding 6 locations in distant Houston, Texas, with almost all of the new locations were franchise operations.[10]
Four years later the 70-unit El Pollo Loco was acquired by TW Services when TW Services purchased El Pollo Loco's then parent Denny's Inc. in 1987 for $218 million in cash.[11][12]
In May 1990 El Pollo Loco opened its 200th restaurant in Yorba Linda.[13] During the early 1990s the company experimented with many different concepts to increase marketshare in the competitive Southern Californian fast food industry. In 1994 the company test marketed at a select few locations: a side-dish bar, salsa bar, and barbecue at some locations, while other locations tried selling french fries or ice cream.[14] Only salsa bars survived the test and were introduced chainwide the following year.[15] The company also tested home delivery and catering in 1995.[15]
In August 1995 El Pollo Loco earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for building the world's largest burrito in Anaheim, California. The burrito was 3,112 feet (949 m) long and weighed two tons.[16]
American Securities Capital Partners acquired the 274-location El Pollo Loco in 1999 for $114 Million[17] and sold it to Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005 for $400 Million with 328 locations.[18][19]
In January 2007, El Pollo Loco was featured on NBC TV's hit show The Apprentice: Los Angeles where contestants competed by creating and selling versions of El Pollo Loco's Pollo Bowl.[20] El Pollo Loco was recognized by the World Franchising Network as a Top Franchise for Hispanics in 2010.[21]
New locations were first open by franchisees in the states of Utah[22] and Oregon[23] in 2008. The 400th location was opened in Chelsea, Massachusetts in May 2008.[24]
In July 2014, El Loco Pollo (NASDAQ: LOCO) became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ.[25][26]
Temporary expansion eastward[edit]
Throughout its history, El Pollo Loco, Inc., tried at various times to expand beyond its core territories of California and the American Southwest, but all of these attempts were so far not very successful.
In 1987, then owner TW Services began to open restaurants in the Orlando area, starting in Winter Park, Florida.[27] Five restaurants were eventually built but all five were forced to close in 1991.[28]
A second expansion attempt, mainly though franchises, was started in 2006 under then owner Trimaran Capital Partners.[29][30][31] All of these locations were closed within six years.
During this time, El Pollo Loco or its franchisees briefly operated several restaurants in metro Atlanta,[32] and Boston,[24][33] New Jersey[34] and in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia;[35] these closed by 2011. The chain's franchised restaurants in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area[23][36] also closed in 2011. An El Pollo Loco in the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut[37] closed in spring 2012. The last of four Chicago area[38][39][40] stores closed at the end of 2012.
Locations within the United States[edit]
In the U.S., the El Pollo Loco chain operates over 400 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, and California. In 2012, El Pollo Loco restaurants went through a major makeover.[41]
Locations outside of North America[edit]
Under Denny's and its successors, El Pollo Loco, Inc., had sold franchise licenses to operators based in East Asia. By 1997, EPL, Inc., had franchises located in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.[42] The franchise licenses for both Malaysia and Singapore has since lapsed. In July 2016, the Delgado family, owners of the El Pollo Loco franchise in the Philippines, filed a lawsuit against EPL, Inc. in the Regional Trial Court so it could retain the El Pollo Loco trademark in that country after the franchise contract had terminated.[43]
Charity partners[edit]
The brand created Fire-Grilled Fundraisers, an initiative for nonprofit organizations to raise funds for their cause while dining at the restaurant. They also created El Pollo Loco Charities, a nonprofit 501(c) charity to provide meals to underprivileged families, in 2005.[44]

The El Pollo Loco locations in Mexico are not affiliated with or operated by the Costa Mesa, California-based El Pollo Loco, Inc. but are operated by Mexico-based El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V., which is still owned by founder Juan Francisco Ochoa and his family.[45] The company specializes in selling Sinaloa-style marinaded grilled chicken.
In Mexico, El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V., operates as El Pollo Loco in over 40 locations within Mexico City and the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, Michoacán, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas, of which 32 of those being located in Nuevo León.[46]
History of the Mexican chain[edit]
Ochoa opened his first location in Guasave in the state of Sinaloa on January 6, 1974 at a small roadside location containing ten tables and with a starting working capital of 15 thousand pesos. His wife Flérida created a fruit-based marinade which was used to coat the chicken for several hours prior to grilling. After a few hours of operations on their first day, they sold out all 43 chickens.[45][47][48]
Three years later, Ochoa's brother Jaime quit his job and opened the company's second location in San Luis Potosi. This was quickly followed by other locations that were opened and operated by Ochoa's other brothers and sisters in Guadalajara, Morelia, Monterrey, and Saltillo.[45]
By the end of 1979, Ochoa had 85 restaurants in 20 cities throughout Northern Mexico with many of the locations operated by family members or close friends.[47] At that time, Ochoa thought about expanding north of the borders into areas of the United States that he had previously visited. In 1980, Ochoa opened his first U.S. location on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, an area which had a high concentration of immigrants from Sinaloa.[7][45]
The company rapidly expanded on both sides of the international border during the early 1980s. However a number of bad decisions caused by a non-related manager caused the company to accumulate $3 million in debts and created a cash flow problem that forced Ochoa to sell his properties outside of Mexico to help cover those debts.[45]
In September 1983, Ochoa sold the 19 U.S. locations, all of which were located in Southern California, to Denny's[9][49] for either $12.6 million[50] or $11.3 million.[10] At the time of the sale, Ochoa had retained 92 locations within Mexico.[9] As part of the agreement, Denny's promised to assist Ochoa in opening new locations in the parts of Mexico that Ochoa's company did not then occupy. In 2004, the Mexican company filed suit in U.S. Federal Court against the American company for failure to fulfill the joint expansion agreement. After three years of litigation, the Court ruled against the American company and ordered the American company to pay $22 million in damages and to return the ownership of the "El Pollo Loco" trademark and intellectual property within Mexico back to the Mexican company.[51][52]
As a result of the debt debacle created during the early 1980s by a non-family manager, the number of locations has since shrunk to approximately 40 locations, all of which are managed and operated by family members.[45]
After the sale of the American locations in 1983, Ochoa restricted his business activities to Mexico. However, the lure of new business activities north of the Rio Grande was too hard to resist and Ochoa opened his new business, called Taco Palenque, in Laredo, Texas in 1987.[53]
Menu[edit]
Unlike its American counterpart, the Mexican chain has kept its menu simple and focused on the grilled chicken. Deboned chicken or other animal protein like shrimp or carne asada are not available. Standard Mexican-American fare such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are also not available. The chain does offer french fries (Papas a la Francesa), cole slaw (Ensalada de Col), macaroni salad (Ensalada de Coditos), and charro beans to go with the pieces of grilled chicken.[54]
Controversies[edit]
In January 2016, the Secretaría de Salud de Nuevo León, the Health Ministry for the Mexican state of Nuevo León, closed several franchised locations of El Pollo Loco for several health code violations.[55] At least one of the locations was owned by Mexican politician Marco González who claimed that the closures were politically motivated.[56]

El Pollo Loco executives are currently testing a barbecue concept, as well as a joint operation with a Fosters Freeze store in Upland, Calif., a project that might lead to the introduction of ice creams chainwide.

^ a b Monson, Rani Cher (February 16, 1995). "El Pollo Loco will open more outlets, boost menu, remodel". Orange County Register. p. c.02. The Irvine-based fast-food chain has other plans, too. For starters, $6.6 million will be spent to remodel all 206 El Pollo Loco locations. Changes include an exterior overhaul, installing new lamps and adding salsa bars at every location. The goal is to finish the job systemwide by 1996. Also, the company might expand a recent experiment in catering and home delivery. The company says the services were so popular during the holidays that the idea might go chainwide. All 31 Orange County locations cater, and one Huntington Beach store has home delivery. The menu, once topheavy with chicken, will get several new items, including fish tacos, mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. Six entrees and five side dishes were added last year, helping to boost the company's sales.  Link via ProQuest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Guac, Guac. Who’s there? El Pollo Loco obviously. We know a thing or two about fresh guacamole. We start each day by hand slicing thousands of the finest Hass avocados in our restaurants – one by one. All to create the masterpiece we call our guacamole. That’s no joke.









 


DescriptionTileImage


At El Pollo Loco, we’re all about making delicious, authentic food–and it all starts with our fresh, real ingredients. That’s why we slowly grill our citrus-marinated whole chickens over an open flame, and hand-prepare our guacamole and fresh pico de gallo salsa. And we do it every single day. Because to us, it’s not just food–it’s our passion.

When we go to sleep, we count chickens – all 147 of them. That's about how many fresh whole chickens we fire-grill at our restaurants every day.  Meaning every single bite of chicken here at El Pollo Loco isn't just delicious, it's right off the grill and served fresh in our entrees. 









 


DescriptionTileImage


Giving tomatoes the love they deserve. All 357 of them, to be exact. That’s about how many tomatoes we hand-chop at each El Pollo Loco restaurant every single day. Because here, we strongly believe in preparing fresh ingredients by hand—and you can taste it in every dish, from our pico de gallo salsa to our handmade guacamole. What can we say? Preparation is kind of our thing.









 


DescriptionTileImage


Bringing the heat, one serrano pepper at a time. There’s only one way to do spice—and it’s not with frozen peppers. That’s why we only use real, fresh serrano peppers here at El Pollo Loco. And we chop, slice and dice them by hand every single day. Maybe that’s why our pico de gallo, avocado salsa and guacamole taste so delicious—but that’s just a wild guess. 









 


DescriptionTileImage


We’re passionate about fresh ingredients—especially when it comes to our Creamy Cilantro Dressing, which we prepare every day. A combination of fresh cilantro, grated cotija cheese, ground roasted pepitas, and pureed green chilies, our Creamy Cilantro Dressing can only be described as smooth and delicious. Whether you try it with our Chicken Tostada Salad, Chicken Avocado Burrito or Chicken Tortilla Roll, you really can’t go wrong.
