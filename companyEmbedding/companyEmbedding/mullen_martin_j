Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.

						The touching melody of this brand new setting from Rebecca Mullen and Joseph Martin is a perfect match for Samuel Stennett's 18th-century text, "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand." As is true of so much of Martin's work, most of this piece is written for two-part mixed voices, making it a perfect choice for the smaller church choir.

OverviewHonorsThought LeadershipMembershipsMartin J. Smith is a partner in the Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation Group of the Tax Practice in the firm's Los Angeles office. Areas of PracticeMr. Smith has over thirty years of experience as an ERISA attorney in the benefits consulting field.  Mr. Smith’s experience includes designing, implementing, and helping administer both tax qualified retirement plans (such as defined benefits plans, profit-sharing plans, and 401(k) arrangements), and nonqualified plans (such as deferred compensation plans, supplemental executive retirement plans, stock option plans and stock purchase plans), as well as health and welfare benefit plans.  Mr. Smith provides fiduciary advice with respect to investment and fiduciary issues, including the applicability of the Department of Labor “plan asset” regulations, prohibited transactions, and unrelated business taxable income.  Mr. Smith also provides advice with respect to the investment of plan assets in real estate.  Mr. Smith has extensive experience in assisting clients with employee benefits within the context of corporate transactions including mergers, acquisitions, and spin-offs.  In addition, he has helped develop tax planning techniques that utilize various benefit arrangements, such as ESOPs and VEBAs, and has helped clients comply with the complex reporting requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.  Because of increased IRS scrutiny of 403(b) tax sheltered annuities and 401(k) arrangements, Mr. Smith has helped clients review these plans to determine if they meet the requirements of ERISA and the Code, and has assisted clients with IRS audits of these plans.  Mr. Smith also assists clients with meeting the healthcare continuation requirements of COBRA, and the healthcare portability and privacy requirements of HIPAA.  Mr. Smith has also worked with our clients to help maintain the tax qualification of their plans by utilizing the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System ("EPCRS"), as well as limit fiduciary liability through the use of the Department of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program ("VFCP").

Mullen, Martin J. LENOX Martin John "Jack" Mullen, 91, died on Friday, January 22, 2016, at Kimball Farms Nursing Care Center, where he resided. The cause of death was complications from Lewy Body Disease. The only child of the late Martin Thomas and Gertrude Ryan Mullen, Mr. Mullen was born in Adams, Mass. January 18, 1925. Mr. Mullen was President of Mullen Bros., Inc. of North Adams, an interstate trucking company established in 1880 by his grandfather. Mr. Mullen was a founding agent of the Aero Mayflower Transit Company, and served as President of the Mayflower Warehousemen's Association. In this capacity, Mr. Mullen was instrumental in building the Mayflower brand into the most recognizable name in long-distance moving. A business and civic leader for more than 40 years, Mr. Mullen served on many boards often in the capacity as an officer. Among those boards were the Agricultural Bank, the Massachusetts Movers Association, Berkshire County Development Corporation, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Berkshire Traffic Association, and the Greater Chamber of Commerce of North Adams. Mr. Mullen was a member of the Elks and a past exalted ruler, a member of the North Adams Country Club, Pittsfield Country Club, Lions and Rotary. He also served on the Committee to Build and Operate Charles H. McCann School of Vocational Education, as well as serving on the Original Committee for the Flood Control Project under then-President Truman. Mr. Mullen enjoyed politics throughout his life and attended President John F. Kennedy's Inauguration and often visited Congress on matters concerning the Transportation Industry and his community. He held many political functions at the family home on South Mountain Road including a reception for Presidential Candidate Birch Bayh. Mr. Mullen enjoyed parades, often having large, well-produced, floats in the Fall Foliage and 4th of July Parades, accompanied with his collection of antique moving trucks and cars, and recruiting as many family and neighborhood kids to ride along. Jack enjoyed grilling steak in the back yard on South Mountain with his family, and a good football game often at West Point watching Army, or at the then Boston Patriots in Boston, having season tickets for both. Mr. Mullen was graduated from Drury High School in North Adams where he captained the football team and lettered in three sports for three years. He attended Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia on a football scholarship. Mr. Mullen, at 18, then enlisted in the Army Air Forces and served with the 494th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group. During World War II Mr. Mullen fought in the air offensive in Europe, Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, and Ardennes. Mr. Mullen is a recipient of the Soldiers Medal, awarded for rescuing Airmen from a crashed and burning aircraft while the plane's ordnance exploded. Just before going into the service, Mr. Mullen met Geraldine Shaw of Adams in the Crest, the town's most popular ice cream parlor. They were married February 18, 1945, just after he was discharged from the service, and made their life and their family's home in The Berkshires. Mr. Mullen spent his early life in North Adams. In 1967, he moved the family to South Mountain Road in Pittsfield. In their later years, Jack and Gerry would spend winters in Marco Island, Fla. Survivors include children Barbara Devine (Jack); Shannon Kirby; Mary Mullen (Laurence Oberwager); and Martin (Denise), seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. Mr. Mullen was predeceased by his wife, Geraldine Mae Shaw, who died on November 1, 2012, and by his daughter, Sheila Ryan Uccellini, who died on August 10, 2011. Mr. Mullen was also predeceased by son-in-law's Thomas S. Barnes, Walter F. Uccellini, and Thomas F. Kirby. There are no calling hours. Memorial and Burial Services for Martin John Mullen will be Thursday, January 28, and are private for the family. In lieu of flowers, Memorial Contributions may be made to an Educational or Charitable Organization of your choice. The Paciorek Funeral Home, 13 Hoosac St., Adams, is in charge of arrangements.

“Wonderfully Drinkable” Gambero Rosso
When Gambero Rosso’s annual wine guide drops, the Italian wine world stops, as winemakers scan the influential Italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes. Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is a perennial Gambero favorite, having earned multiple “Due Bicchieri” (“Two Glasses”) honors in addition to praise as a “sincere, wonderfully drinkable wine.” The Wine Access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more, and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent 2015 vintage by the case. 
The land of Badia di Morrona in the picturesque hills between Florence and Pisa was first worked by 11th century Benedictine monks. Today it is owned by Count Gaslini Alberti, who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past 50 years, outfitting winemaker Corrado Dal Piaz with a refurbished facility, enlarged cellars, and new casks and barrels.
Dal Piaz is notoriously hard on the Badia’s 282 acres of grapes, which soak up the sun on south- and south-eastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone. He tightened spacing in the vines, orchestrating a Darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skin-to-juice ratio. The result is Sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity.
2015’s long growing season allowed temperamental Sangiovese to reach rare, almost perfectly uniform maturity. The vines stretched deep underground, sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil, putting out a dark, crushed-red-fruit Sangiovese, infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins.
If you’re looking for vibrancy in your top-class Chianti, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything quite like this luscious 2015. At $13.99 (and as Gambero Rosso would advise), this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation.








Tasting Notes



WineAccess Travel Log
The 2015 Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is bright ruby to the edge, with a fabulous nose of wild berry, blue flower, and tangy spices. Juicy and high-toned on the attack, with sneaky weight and supple texture. This is textbook Chianti.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.
