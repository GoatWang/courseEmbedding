The parents of Austin Tice, the journalist and former Marine from Texas who was abducted in Syria in August 2012, said on Wednesday that they had reason to believe that their son was alive.“We wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you if we didn’t — weren’t completely positive that Austin’s going to come home safely,” his father, Marc Tice, told Lester Holt in an interview on “NBC Nightly News.”

Debra Tice and her husband, who also spoke with Matt Lauer on “Today” on Wednesday morning, confirmed that the United States government had shared with them why it thought he was alive, but they would not elaborate on the reasons.“We need to keep their confidence, so that we can keep working well together as a team,” Ms. Tice told Mr. Lauer.

The Trump administration began searching early this year for ways to free Mr. Tice, even setting up a back channel with Syria.

“We are absolutely gratified at the engagement we’ve had with this new administration,” Ms. Tice told Mr. Holt. “How quickly they’ve become aware and engaged and advocating for Austin’s safe return.” Continue reading the main story

The Syrian government insists it does not know what happened to Mr. Tice or where he is. And his parents said that they had seen no proof that he was alive, they told Mr. Holt, aside from a YouTube video that was posted one month after Mr. Tice disappeared.In the video, titled “Austin Tice Still Alive,” he appears blindfolded and disheveled, and is surrounded by masked men with rifles. He utters part of an Arabic prayer and says, “Oh, Jesus.”

Last year, in a secret analysis, the American intelligence community said there was a good chance that Mr. Tice was alive. But the momentum to find Mr. Tice stalled in April when the Syrian government carried out a gas attack on its own people, killing dozens.Outrage about American hostages being held by foreign governments was renewed last week after the death of Otto Warmbier, a college student from Ohio who spent more than a year in a North Korean prison before being medically evacuated to the United States.The Tices — who lived in Damascus for a time to search for information about their son — stressed that the effort to bring their son home is a humanitarian one, not a foreign policy issue. “We have to be completely apolitical,” she said.Mr. Tice will turn 36 years old on Aug. 11. “We’re really hoping that we can hand him his birthday cards in person,” his father said.

 Correction: June 28, 2017  
An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the father of Austin Tice on first reference. He is Marc Tice, not Price.

WARNING
TICE® BCG contains live, attenuated mycobacteria. Because of the potential risk for transmission, it should be prepared, handled, and disposed of as a biohazard material (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).
BCG infections have been reported in health care workers, primarily from exposures resulting from accidental needle sticks or skin lacerations during the preparation of BCG for administration. Nosocomial infections have been reported in patients receiving parenteral drugs that were prepared in areas in which BCG was reconstituted. BCG is capable of dissemination when administered by the intravesical route, and serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving intravesical BCG (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections).

TICE BCG Description






TICE® BCG for intravesical use, is an attenuated, live culture preparation of the Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) strain of Mycobacterium bovis.1 The TICE strain was developed at the University of Illinois from a strain originated at the Pasteur Institute.
The medium in which the BCG organism is grown for preparation of the freeze-dried cake is composed of the following ingredients: glycerin, asparagine, citric acid, potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and iron ammonium citrate. The final preparation prior to freeze drying also contains lactose. The freeze-dried BCG preparation is delivered in glass vials, each containing 1 to 8 × 108 colony forming units (CFU) of TICE BCG which is equivalent to approximately 50 mg wet weight. Determination of in vitro potency is achieved through colony counts derived from a serial dilution assay. A single dose consists of 1 reconstituted vial (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
For intravesical use the entire vial is reconstituted with sterile saline. TICE BCG is viable upon reconstitution.
No preservatives have been added.
TICE BCG - Clinical Pharmacology
TICE® BCG induces a granulomatous reaction at the local site of administration. Intravesical TICE BCG has been used as a therapy for, and prophylaxis against, recurrent tumors in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary bladder, and to prevent recurrence of Stage TaT1 papillary tumors of the bladder at high risk of recurrence. The precise mechanism of action is unknown.

Clinical Studies
To evaluate the efficacy of intravesical administration of TICE® BCG in the treatment of carcinoma in situ, patients were identified who had been treated with TICE BCG under 6 different Investigational New Drug (IND) applications in which the most important shared aspect was the use of an induction plus maintenance schedule. Patients received TICE BCG (50 mg; 1 to 8 x 108 CFU) intravesically, once weekly for at least 6 weeks and once monthly thereafter for up to 12 months. A longer maintenance was given in some cases. The study population consisted of 153 patients, 132 males, 19 females, and 2 unidentified as to gender. Thirty patients lacking baseline documentation of CIS and 4 patients lost to follow-up were not evaluable for treatment response. Therefore, 119 patients were available for efficacy evaluation. The mean age was 69 years (range: 38–97 years). There were 2 categories of clinical response: (1) Complete Histological Response (CR), defined as complete resolution of carcinoma in situ documented by cystoscopy and cytology, with or without biopsy; and (2) Complete Clinical Response Without Cytology (CRNC), defined as an apparent complete disappearance of tumor upon cystoscopy. The results of a 1987 analysis of the evaluable patients are shown in Table 1.

There was no significant difference in response rates between patients with or without prior intravesical chemotherapy. The median duration of response, calculated from the Kaplan-Meier curve as median time to recurrence, is estimated at 4 years or greater. The incidence of cystectomy for 90 patients who achieved a complete response (CR or CRNC) was 11%. The median time to cystectomy in patients who achieved a complete response (CR or CRNC) exceeded 74 months.
The efficacy of intravesical TICE BCG in preventing the recurrence of a TaT1 bladder cancer after complete transurethral resection of all papillary tumors was evaluated in 2 open-label, randomized phase III clinical trials. Initial diagnosis of patients included in the studies was determined by cystoscopic biopsies. One was conducted by the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) in patients at high risk of recurrence. High risk was defined as 2 occurrences of tumor within 56 weeks, any stage T1 tumor, or 3 or more tumors presenting simultaneously. The second study was conducted at the Nijmegen University Hospital; Nijmegen, The Netherlands. In this study patients were not selected for high risk of recurrence. In both studies treatment was initiated between 1 and 2 weeks after transurethral resection (TUR).
In the SWOG trial (study 8795) patients were randomized to TICE BCG or mitomycin C (MMC). Both drugs were given intravesically weekly for 6 weeks, at 8 and 12 weeks, and then monthly for a total treatment duration of 1 year. Cystoscopy and urinary cytology were performed every 3 months for 2 years. Patients with progressive disease or residual or recurrent disease at or after the 6 month follow-up were removed from the study and were classified as treatment failures.
A total of 469 patients was entered into the study: 237 to the TICE BCG arm and 232 to the MMC arm. Twenty-two patients were subsequently found to be ineligible, and 66 patients had concurrent CIS, and were analyzed separately. Four patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 191 evaluable patients in the TICE BCG arm and 186 in the MMC arm. Of the patients, 84% were male and 16% were female. The average age of these patients was 65 years old.
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2-year disease-free survival are shown in Table 3. The difference in disease-free survival time between the 2 groups was statistically significant by the log rank test (P=0.03). The 95% confidence interval of the difference in 2-year disease-free survival was 12% ± 10%. No statistically significant differences between the groups were noted in time to tumor progression, tumor invasion, or overall survival.

In the Nijmegen study, the efficacy of 3 treatments was compared: TICE substrain BCG, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieuhygiene substrain BCG (BCG-RIVM), and MMC.
TICE BCG and BCG-RIVM were given intravesically weekly for 6 weeks. In contrast to the SWOG study, maintenance BCG was not given. Mitomycin C was given intravesically weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for a total duration of treatment of 6 months. Cystoscopy and urinary cytology were performed every 3 months until recurrence.
A total of 469 patients was enrolled and randomized. Thirty-two patients were not evaluable, 17 were ineligible, 15 were withdrawn before treatment, and 50 had concurrent CIS and were analyzed separately, leaving 387 evaluable patients: 117 in the TICE BCG arm, 134 in the BCG-RIVM arm, and 136 in the MMC arm. Twenty-eight patients (24%) in the TICE BCG arm, 32 patients (24%) in the BCG-RIVM arm, and 24 patients (18%) in the MMC arm had TaG1 tumors. The median duration of follow-up was 22 months (range: 3–54 months).
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2-year disease-free survival are shown in Table 4. The differences in disease-free survival among the 3 arms were not statistically significant by the log-rank test (P=0.08).

In both the SWOG 8795 study and the Nijmegen study, acute toxicity was more common, and usually more severe, with TICE BCG than with MMC (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).
Indications and Usage for TICE BCG
TICE® BCG is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary bladder, and for the prophylaxis of primary or recurrent stage Ta and/or T1 papillary tumors following transurethral resection (TUR). TICE BCG is not recommended for stage TaG1 papillary tumors, unless they are judged to be at high risk of tumor recurrence.
TICE BCG is not indicated for papillary tumors of stages higher than T1.
Contraindications
TICE® BCG should not be used in immunosuppressed patients or persons with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, whether due to concurrent disease (e.g., AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma) cancer therapy (e.g., cytotoxic drugs, radiation), or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids).
Treatment should be postponed until resolution of a concurrent febrile illness, urinary tract infection, or gross hematuria. Seven to 14 days should elapse before BCG is administered following biopsy, TUR, or traumatic catheterization.
TICE BCG should not be administered to persons with active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis should be ruled out in individuals who are PPD positive before starting treatment with TICE BCG.





Warnings
BCG LIVE (TICE® BCG) is not a vaccine for the prevention of cancer. BCG Vaccine USP, not BCG LIVE (TICE BCG), should be used for the prevention of tuberculosis. For vaccination use, refer to BCG Vaccine USP prescribing information.
TICE BCG is an infectious agent. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on the prevention and treatment of BCG-related complications, and should be prepared in such emergencies to contact an infectious disease specialist with experience in treating the infectious complications of intravesical BCG. The treatment of the infectious complications of BCG requires long-term, multiple-drug antibiotic therapy. Special culture media are required for mycobacteria, and physicians administering intravesical BCG or those caring for these patients should have these media readily available.
Instillation of TICE BCG with an actively bleeding mucosa may promote systemic BCG infection. Treatment should be postponed for at least 1 week following transurethral resection, biopsy, traumatic catheterization, or gross hematuria.
Deaths have been reported as a result of systemic BCG infection and sepsis.2,3 Patients should be monitored for the presence of symptoms and signs of toxicity after each intravesical treatment. Febrile episodes with flu-like symptoms lasting more than 72 hours, fever ≥103°F, systemic manifestations increasing in intensity with repeated instillations, or persistent abnormalities of liver function tests suggest systemic BCG infection and may require antituberculous therapy. Local symptoms (prostatitis, epididymitis, orchitis) lasting more than 2 to 3 days may also suggest active infection (see WARNINGS, Management of Serious BCG Complications section).
The use of TICE BCG may cause tuberculin sensitivity. Since this is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, it is advisable to determine the tuberculin reactivity by PPD skin testing before treatment.
Intravesical instillations of BCG should be postponed during treatment with antibiotics, since antimicrobial therapy may interfere with the effectiveness of TICE BCG (see PRECAUTIONS). TICE BCG should not be used in individuals with concurrent infections.
Small bladder capacity has been associated with increased risk of severe local reactions and should be considered in deciding to use TICE BCG therapy.

Management of Serious BCG Complications
Acute, localized irritative toxicities of TICE BCG may be accompanied by systemic manifestations, consistent with a "flu-like" syndrome. Systemic adverse effects of 1 to 2 days' duration such as malaise, fever, and chills often reflect hypersensitivity reactions. However, symptoms such as fever of ≥38.5°C (101.3°F), or acute localized inflammation such as epididymitis, prostatitis, or orchitis persisting longer than 2 to 3 days suggest active infection, and evaluation for serious infectious complication should be considered.
In patients who develop persistent fever or experience an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, 2 or more antimycobacterial agents should be administered while diagnostic evaluation, including cultures, is conducted. BCG treatment should be discontinued. Negative cultures do not necessarily rule out infection. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of BCG-related complications and, when appropriate, should consult an infectious disease specialist or other physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infections.
TICE BCG is sensitive to the most commonly used antituberculous agents (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol). TICE BCG is not sensitive to pyrazinamide.

Precautions
General
TICE® BCG contains live mycobacteria and should be prepared and handled using aseptic technique (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of Agent section). BCG infections have been reported in health care workers preparing BCG for administration. Needle stick injuries should be avoided during the handling and mixing of TICE BCG. Nosocomial infections have been reported in patients receiving parenteral drugs which were prepared in areas in which BCG was prepared.4
BCG is capable of dissemination when administered by intravesical route, and serious reactions, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving intravesical BCG.3 Care should be taken not to traumatize the urinary tract or to introduce contaminants into the urinary system. Seven to 14 days should elapse before TICE BCG is administered following TUR, biopsy, or traumatic catheterization.
TICE BCG should be administered with caution to persons in groups at high risk for HIV infection.
Laboratory Tests
The use of TICE BCG may cause tuberculin sensitivity. It is advisable to determine the tuberculin reactivity of patients receiving TICE BCG by PPD skin testing before treatment is initiated.
Information for Patients
TICE BCG is retained in the bladder for 2 hours and then voided. Patients should void while seated in order to avoid splashing of urine. For the 6 hours after treatment, urine voided should be disinfected for 15 minutes with an equal volume of household bleach before flushing. Patients should be instructed to increase fluid intake in order to "flush" the bladder in the hours following BCG treatment. Patients may experience burning with the first void after treatment.
Patients should be attentive to side effects, such as fever, chills, malaise, flu-like symptoms, or increased fatigue. If the patient experiences severe urinary side effects, such as burning or pain on urination, urgency, frequency of urination, blood in urine, or other symptoms such as joint pain, cough, or skin rash, the physician should be notified.
Drug Interaction
Drug combinations containing immunosuppressants and/or bone marrow depressants and/or radiation interfere with the development of the immune response and should not be used in combination with TICE BCG. Antimicrobial therapy for other infections may interfere with the effectiveness of TICE BCG. There are no data to suggest that the acute, local urinary tract toxicity common with BCG is due to mycobacterial infection, and antituberculosis drugs (e.g., isoniazid) should not be used to prevent or treat the local, irritative toxicities of TICE BCG.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
TICE BCG has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic, mutagenic potentials, or impairment of fertility.
Pregnancy
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TICE BCG. It is also not known whether TICE BCG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. TICE BCG should not be given to a pregnant woman except when clearly needed. Women should be advised not to become pregnant while on therapy.
Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether TICE BCG is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from TICE BCG in nursing infants, it is advisable to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness of TICE BCG for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer in pediatric patients have not been established.
Geriatric Use
Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of TICE BCG, the average age was 66 years old. No overall difference in safety or effectiveness was observed between older and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to BCG cannot be ruled out.

Adverse Reactions
Symptoms of bladder irritability, related to the inflammatory response induced, are reported in approximately 60% of patients receiving TICE® BCG. The symptoms typically begin 4 to 6 hours after instillation and last 24 to 72 hours. The irritative side effects are usually seen following the third instillation, and tend to increase in severity after each administration.
The irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be managed symptomatically with products such as pyridium, propantheline bromide, oxybutynin chloride, and acetaminophen. The mechanism of action of the irritative side effects has not been firmly established, but is most consistent with an immunological mechanism.3 There is no evidence that dose reduction or antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative toxicity of TICE BCG.
"Flu-like" symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which may accompany the localized, irritative toxicities often reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically. Antihistamines have also been used.5
Adverse reactions to TICE BCG tend to be progressive in frequency and severity with subsequent instillation. Delay or postponement of subsequent treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a reaction during subsequent instillation.
Although uncommon, serious infectious complications of intravesical BCG have been reported.2,3,6 The most serious infectious complication of BCG is disseminated sepsis with associated mortality. In addition, M. bovis infections have been reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, kidney, regional lymph nodes, and prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG. Systemic infections may be manifested by pneumonitis, hepatitis, cytopenia, infective aneurysm and/or sepsis after a period of fever and malaise during which symptoms progressively increase. Some male genitourinary tract infections (orchitis/epididymitis) have been resistant to multiple-drug antituberculous therapy and required orchiectomy.
If a patient develops persistent fever or experiences an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, BCG treatment should be discontinued and the patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic infection (see WARNINGS).
The local and systemic adverse reactions reported in a review of 674 patients with superficial bladder cancer, including 153 patients with carcinoma in situ, are summarized in Table 5.

The following adverse events were reported in ≤1% of patients: anemia, BCG sepsis, coagulopathy, contracted bladder, diarrhea, epididymitis/prostatitis, hepatic granuloma, hepatitis, leukopenia, neurologic (unclassified), orchitis, pneumonitis, pyuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, urethritis, and urinary obstruction.
In SWOG study 8795, toxicity evaluations were available on a total of 222 TICE BCG-treated patients and 220 MMC-treated patients. Direct bladder toxicity (cramps, dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, hemorrhagic cystitis, or incontinence) was seen more often with TICE BCG with 356 events, compared to 234 events for MMC. Grade ≤2 toxicity was seen significantly more frequently following TICE BCG treatment (P=0.003). No life-threatening toxicity was seen in either arm. Systemic toxicity with TICE BCG was markedly increased compared to that of MMC, with 181 events for TICE BCG compared to 80 for MMC. The frequency of toxicity was increased in all grades, particularly for grades 2 and 3. The most common complaints were malaise, fatigue and lethargy, fever, and abdominal pain. Thirty-two TICE BCG patients were reported to have been treated with isoniazid. Five TICE BCG patients had liver enzyme elevation, including 2 with grade 3 elevations. Eighteen of the 222 (8.1%) TICE BCG patients failed to complete the prescribed protocol compared to 6.2% in the MMC group. Table 6 summarizes the most common adverse reactions reported in this trial.7

Overdosage
Overdosage occurs if more than 1 vial of TICE® BCG is administered per instillation. If overdosage occurs, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of active local or systemic BCG infection. For acute local or systemic reactions suggesting active infection, an infectious disease specialist experienced in BCG complications should be consulted.

TICE BCG Dosage and Administration
The dose for the intravesical treatment of carcinoma in situ and for the prophylaxis of recurrent papillary tumors consists of 1 vial of TICE® BCG suspended in 50 mL preservative-free saline.
Do not inject subcutaneously or intravenously.

Preparation of Agent
The preparation of the TICE BCG suspension should be done using aseptic technique. To avoid cross-contamination, parenteral drugs should not be prepared in areas where BCG has been prepared. A separate area for the preparation of the TICE BCG suspension is recommended. All equipment, supplies, and receptacles in contact with TICE BCG should be handled and disposed of as biohazardous. The pharmacist or individual responsible for mixing the agent should wear gloves and take precautions to avoid contact of BCG with broken skin. If preparation cannot be performed in a biocontainment hood, then a mask and gown should be worn to avoid inhalation of BCG organisms and inadvertent exposure to broken skin.
Draw 1 mL of sterile, preservative-free saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP) at 4–25°C into a small syringe (e.g., 3 mL) and add to 1 vial of TICE BCG to resuspend. Gently swirl the vial until a homogenous suspension is obtained. Avoid forceful agitation which may cause clumping of the mycobacteria. Dispense the cloudy TICE BCG suspension into the top end of a catheter-tip syringe which contains 49 mL of saline diluent, bringing the total volume to 50 mL. To mix, gently rotate the syringe.
The reconstituted TICE BCG should be kept refrigerated (2–8°C), protected from exposure to direct sunlight, and used within 2 hours. Unused solution should be discarded after 2 hours.
Note: DO NOT filter the contents of the TICE BCG vial. Precautions should be taken to avoid exposing the TICE BCG to direct sunlight. Bacteriostatic solutions must be avoided. In addition, use only sterile, preservative-free saline, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP as diluent.
Treatment and Schedule
Allow 7 to 14 days to elapse after bladder biopsy before TICE BCG is administered. Patients should not drink fluids for 4 hours before treatment and should empty their bladder prior to TICE BCG administration. The reconstituted TICE BCG is instilled into the bladder by gravity flow via the catheter. DO NOT depress plunger and force the flow of the TICE BCG. The TICE BCG is retained in the bladder 2 hours and then voided. Patients unable to retain the suspension for 2 hours should be allowed to void sooner, if necessary.
While the BCG is retained in the bladder, the patient ideally should be repositioned from left side to right side and also should lie upon the back and the abdomen, changing these positions every 15 minutes to maximize bladder surface exposure to the agent.
A standard treatment schedule consists of 1 intravesical instillation per week for 6 weeks. This schedule may be repeated once if tumor remission has not been achieved and if the clinical circumstances warrant. Thereafter, intravesical TICE BCG administration should continue at approximately monthly intervals for at least 6 to 12 months. There are no data to support the interchangeability of BCG LIVE products.
How is TICE BCG Supplied
TICE® BCG is supplied in a box of 1 vial of TICE BCG. Each vial contains 1 to 8 × 108 CFU, which is equivalent to approximately 50 mg (wet weight), as lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, NDC 0052-0602-02.
STORAGE
The intact vials of TICE® BCG should be stored refrigerated, at 2–8°C (36–46°F).
This agent contains live bacteria and should be protected from direct sunlight. The product should not be used after the expiration date printed on the label.

Listening #85


Art Dudley  |  Feb 2, 2010   |  First Published: Jan 2, 2010	











We murder to dissect.William Wordsworth

Tice Clock: Are there two more loaded words in all of hi-fi?

For those too young to know: In 1990, an audio manufacturer named George Tice brought to market a $350 accessory that could improve the sound of any domestic music system, simply by being connected to an AC outlet in the same roomor so he claimed. But the claim was incredible, because the product appeared to be nothing more than a rebadged RadioShack digital alarm clock to which an invisible "proprietary treatment" had been applied. Stereophile borrowed and tested various samples of the Tice Clock, and although one writer said he might have heard a very slight effect, editor John Atkinson summed up our coverage by stating that not only did the Clock fail to perform as advertised, but George Tice's technical explanations for it had no basis in scientific fact. Thomas J. Norton, Stereophile's technical editor at the time, added that the Tice Clock was identical, inside and out, to a $20 RadioShack alarm clockto the naked eye.

An amusing side note: The Tice Clock was also one of the grains of sand around which professional skeptic James Randi oozed the pearl of his famously clever exposé of our hobby. As Randi stated on his website, "The Tate Clock . . . is only one of the items [Stereophile] tested and approved." John Atkinson and I both noted, publicly, that not only did Randi get the product's name wrongan indication that this debunker of mind-readers thinks he can glean information from the printed page without actually having to readbut he misstated our review conclusions by a statistically significant 180°. Randi responded with as much world-weary, can-you-believe-these-fruitcakes condescension as he could muster, decrying our pettiness for even mentioning his "typo"and, of course, ignoring completely the matter of his false report of our review conclusions. As I said: clever (footnote 1).

Field day

Back to the plot: Whenever alternative science is evoked in an attempt to explain the technological workings of an audio component or tweakmore often than not it's the latter, of coursewe of the press would do well to remember l'Affaire Tice. And here's why: Even though Stereophile reported, truthfully, that the Tice Clock was inadequate to every task except reporting the time of day, there remain those who believe we committed a journalistic sin by reporting on it at all.



So it goes, I guess, for any of us who would report on the products of Quantum Resonant Technology, of Santa Monica, California, which I mentioned in last month's "Listening" column. The company's Qx4 audio accessory ($2399) is remarkable for two things: Its use in a good-quality system has a consistently audible effectmusic recordings sound notably and consistently clearer, bigger, more open, and more (naturally) detailedand QRT's explanation of the technological basis of that effect is unsatisfying. The former puts the Qx4 in an altogether higher, nobler plane than the Tice Clock, but the latter still bugs me.

In a nutshell, QRT describes the Qx4 as a "scalar field generator" that uses "technology derived from quantum mechanics" to provide "ordering and stabilization of magnetic field effects." The company also says the Qx4 isn't a filter of any sort, and thus does not impede current delivery in the slightest. The latter is certainly true: The Qx4 places nothing but electrical contacts and heavy-gauge wires in line with the household current. But if the task that it doesn't perform is clear, the one that it does perform remains cloaked in mystery. I won't pretend I understand quantum physics better than anyone else whose post-collegiate science education is limited to reading National Geographic at the dentist's office, but it seems to me that anyone who can design and manufacture a useful, practical, household generator of "scalar fields" would have been kidnapped by the CIA by now and put to work building superweapons, as were Enrico Fermi, Wernher von Braun, and Tony Stark. That a marginal industry such as ours can attract so many people who have successfully farted at the laws of physics never ceases to amaze me.

The skepticism with which I regard Quantum RT's official explanation (footnote 2) also comes from having looked inside one of their Qx4s. Apart from the expected power-supply components, the Qx4's single circuit board contained four discrete transistors, one voltage regulator, four very small capacitors, six resistors, one crystal, four coils, and an 18-pin chip of indeterminate function. (That chip and most of the other parts were obscured by a coating of something hard, dark, and opaque.) Not that this means anything, but I have owned and repaired wah-wah pedals of greater apparent complexity.

Having said all that: The Quantum Qx4 works. Not only does it provide one of the most clearly audible performance differences I've heard from a non-cable accessory, its effect has been documented in a series of laboratory differential tests, conducted by Acuity Products of East Sussex, England (www.acuityproducts.co.uk). I don't think it's a consumer magazine's place to publish a manufacturer's test graphics within the course of a report any more than it's our place to copy a product description, word for word, from a promotional brochure. But you can see Acuity's results for yourself on the Internet. And, yes, they appear quite remarkable.

I have on hand four samples of the Qx4, the most effective being the two that are dedicated to my pair of Audio Note AN-E speakers. (The others, when I use them at all, are adjacent to my preamp and to the AC outlet strip that powers my system.) According to Roy Gregory of Nordost Corp.Nordost distributes Quantum products in the USQx4s positioned directly above or below a conventional loudspeaker control the stray electromagnetic fields given off by, and perhaps reflected back at, the motor of each dynamic driver. In light of that explanation, I couldn't help thinking of the Qx4 as an active version of the altogether passive VPI dB-5, aka the VPI Brick.

Scarcely a week has gone by when I've failed to amuse myself or others by switching those two Qx4s on and off and listening for the difference. This morning, in fact, I invited my wife to play that game. I plugged the AC cords of the two speaker-mounted Qx4s into the same switchable, heavy-duty outlet strip, then sat on the floor between the speakers, the outlet strip in my lap and my back toward the main listening seat. I played one of Janet's current fave albumsLeonard Cohen's Live in London (CD, Sony), an AIFF copy of which I've ripped to my iMacand asked her to let me know whenever it seemed that I might have done something to change the sound overall, and to try to describe the change in her own words, as well as to tell me whether she thought it was a change for the better or for the worse.


Footnote 1: I'm being unfair: James Randi did in fact put me in my place, with a witheringly funny illustration of a 1960s-era cartoon character named Dudley Do-Right. I have hesitated to even think of the great man since then, in apprehension of the even more clever taunts that would surely ensue.

Footnote 2:  "Scalar Field" sounds scientific, but all it means is that any particular property is not associated with a specific direction. Temperature, for example, is a scalar field whereas magnetic and electric fields are not, because they are directional. You can read my thoughts on the misappropriation of scientific terms here.John Atkinson
