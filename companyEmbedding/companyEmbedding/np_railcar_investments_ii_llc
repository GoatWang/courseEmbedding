Napier Park Closes $370 Million Railcar Lease Fund | Business Wire


























































Napier Park Closes $370 Million Railcar Lease Fund




Specialized, Single-Purpose Private Equity Fund Provides Trinity 
      Industries’ Railcar Leasing Business with Greater Financial Flexibility








September 10, 2013 01:33 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Napier Park Global Capital (“Napier Park”), a global alternative asset 
      management firm, announced today that its Financial Partners team has 
      held a final closing of Napier Park Railcar Lease Fund, LLC (the 
      “Railcar Lease Fund” or the “Fund”), a $370 million specialized, 
      single-purpose private equity fund, with an additional direct 
      co-investment of $50 million from a Fund limited partner.
    


      The Railcar Lease Fund has partnered with Trinity Industries, Inc. 
      (NYSE:TRN), a diversified industrial company that includes as one of its 
      principal businesses the manufacture and leasing of railcars, to create 
      RIV 2013 Rail Holdings LLC (“RIV 2013”), a joint venture to invest in 
      leased railcars. The Fund’s capital, along with a direct co-investment 
      from a Fund limited partner and capital from Trinity Industries Leasing 
      Company (“TILC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trinity, was also used to 
      recapitalize TRIP Rail Holdings LLC (“TRIP”), an existing joint venture 
      that owns a pool of leased railcars. TILC provides servicing to both 
      TRIP and RIV 2013. As of June 30, 2013, the combined entities owned a 
      total portfolio of $1.5 billion of railcars on lease to industrial 
      shippers and railroads. The combined portfolio is expected to grow to a 
      railcar value of $2.0 billion by the end of 2014.
    

      “We are excited about the opportunity to partner with Trinity 
      Industries, a leader in railcar manufacturing and leasing,” said Jim 
      O’Brien, co-managing partner of Napier Park Global Capital. “This 
      investment is a clear example of Napier Park’s ability to identify and 
      develop innovative, attractive investments for our clients. Along with 
      our limited partners, we look forward to a long and mutually beneficial 
      relationship with Trinity.”
    

      The Fund’s limited partners include a number of leading U.S. life and 
      property casualty insurance companies. The Fund, which was 
      oversubscribed, now owns 48% of TRIP and 61% of RIV 2013.
    

      “We believe the railcar leasing industry provides a differentiated, 
      durable and cash-yielding investment opportunity for our limited 
      partners,” said Manu Rana, managing director, Napier Park Financial 
      Partners. “We are investing alongside the U.S. railcar industry’s 
      leading manufacturing-lessor, and our investment in a leading railcar 
      lease fleet will benefit from structural shifts toward increased rail 
      transportation.”
    

      “The long-term equity capital Napier Park was able to raise from a 
      prestigious group of institutional investors will provide us with 
      greater financial flexibility to support the continued growth of our 
      railcar lease fleet,” said senior vice president, Trinity Industries and 
      group president of Trinity Rail, D. Stephen Menzies. “We are delighted 
      to have achieved this important strategic objective, and we look forward 
      to working with Napier Park to access additional long-term equity 
      capital for continued growth.”
