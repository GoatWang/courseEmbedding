HIV Aids Vaccine Research  GeoVax - About GeoVax

















































About GeoVaxOur Company
GeoVax Labs, Inc. (OTCBB: GOVX) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing human vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer using our novel Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Virus-Like Particle (VLP) platform technology. Our platform supports production of non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) from the cells of the person receiving the vaccine. Producing VLPs in the person being vaccinated mimics a natural infection, stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system to recognize, prevent and control the target infection should it appear.
Our current development programs are focused on vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hemorrhagic Fever viruses such as Ebola (Zaire, Sudan), Marburg and Lassa, Malaria and Zika virus. We have also initiated programs to develop a vaccine to treat chronic Hepatitis B (HBV) infection and to apply our MVA-VLP vector technology to cancer immunotherapy (immuno-oncology). We believe our technology and vaccine development expertise is well-suited for a wide variety of human diseases for which there is an unmet medical need, and we intend to pursue expansion of our product pipeline.
Our hemorrhagic fever vaccine program was initiated during 2014 in response to the Ebola epidemic in western Africa and with the goal of developing second generation monovalent and multivalent vaccines capable of preventing or containing future outbreaks of major hemorrhagic fever viruses indigenous to Africa. Our initial preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates for our first vaccine candidate (Ebola-Zaire virus) have shown 100% protection against death after a single dose.
Our most advanced vaccines under development are designed to function against the clade B subtype of the HIV virus that is prevalent in the Americas and Western Europe. Our preventive clade B HIV vaccine has successfully completed Phase 2a human clinical testing has entered a follow-on clinical trial in 2017. Our clade B vaccine has shown outstanding safety and excellent, highly reproducible immunogenicity. We are extending our HIV vaccine effort to the most common virus subtype affecting the developing world, clade C. We also are investigating our HIV vaccines for their potential to contribute to combination therapies leading to a cure for HIV infections.
Our vaccine technology was developed in collaboration with researchers at Emory University, the NIH, and the CDC. The technology is exclusively licensed to us from Emory University. We also have nonexclusive licenses to certain patents owned by the NIH. Our hemorrhagic fever vaccines have been developed with technology licensed from, and in collaboration with, the NIH. Our immuno-oncology program is being developed pursuant to a research collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh. Our Zika vaccine program is in collaboration with the CDC. Our HBV therapeutic program is in collaboration with Georgia State University and our malaria vaccine is being developed in collaboration with Burnet Institute in Australia.
Our vaccine development activities have been, and continue to be, financially supported by the U.S. Government. This support has been both in the form of research grants awarded directly to us, in kind support in terms of animal experiments, as well as indirect support for the conduct of our human clinical trials. All of the human clinical trials of our preventative vaccines to date have been conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) with funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

HIV Aids Vaccine Research  GeoVax - Resources

















































What are Viruses?
Viruses are microscopic organisms consisting of genetic material comprised of DNA or ribonucleic acid (“RNA”), surrounded by a protein, lipid (fat), or glycoprotein coat. Viruses invade healthy, living host cells in order to replicate and spread. In many cases, the body’s immune system can recognize and effectively combat an infection caused by a virus. However, with certain viral infections, the body’s immune system is unable to fully destroy or inhibit the replication of the virus, which results in persistent and ongoing viral replication resulting in disease.
Infections caused by viruses can be chronic or acute. Chronic infections, such as those caused by HIV, do not typically self-resolve with time and can cause chronic disease. Acute infections associated with viruses, such as influenza, generally last for a relatively short period of time, and self-resolve in most immuno-competent individuals.
Viruses can also be characterized as either active or latent. An active virus can cause a persistent infection or disease over an extended period of time. A latent virus will remain in the body for very long periods of time after the initial infection and generally will only cause disease when the body’s immune system weakens, fails or is suppressed, allowing the virus to once again replicate. Vaccines have been widely used to prevent active viral infections from occurring.
Viruses that develop resistance to antiviral drugs are increasingly becoming a challenge in the treatment of viral infections, particularly those that are chronic in nature. The ability of viruses to mutate spontaneously during replication allows drug-resistant strains to emerge when patients are using drugs that are not potent enough to quickly and completely inhibit viral replication. Drug resistance occurs because viruses continually replicate making millions of copies of themselves, some of which contain mutations in their genetic material. Mutations that emerge in the presence of a suppressive antiviral drug will give rise to mutant strains that are wholly or partially resistant to that drug. These mutant viruses, while initially low in number, eventually become the predominant strain in an infected patient as those strains that remain susceptible to the drug are inhibited from replicating. Once this occurs, the treatment benefit of that particular antiviral drug often diminishes, resulting in treatment failure and the need for an alternate therapy with different or possibly new drugs, or classes of drugs. In general, viruses that cause chronic infections, such as HIV, are more likely to develop drug resistance due to the long-term and persistent exposure of the virus to the antiviral therapy.

VACCINES SERVING HUMANITY  
GeoVax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing innovative human vaccines using novel Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Virus-Like Particle (VLP) platform technology.
Our proprietary vaccine technology has been developed through multi-year collaborations with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Emory University.  Our mission is to apply our expertise in areas where there is a significant unmet medical need and commercial opportunity with the goal of improving the lives of people affected by serious and life-threatening diseases.
Our current development programs are focused on preventive vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hemorrhagic Fever viruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg and Lassa), Zika virus and malaria. We also have initiated programs to develop therapeutic vaccines to treat chronic Hepatitis B infections and MUC1-positive cancer types in combination with other approaches to achieve a high cure rate. We believe our technology and vaccine development expertise is well-suited for a wide variety of human diseases and we intend to pursue expansion of our product.
We know our work could affect the lives of millions worldwide, and we invite you to join our effort.
