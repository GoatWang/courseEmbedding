Bar Harbor Bankshares And Lake Sunapee Bank Group Complete Merger






Business Wire




Jan 13, 2017 4:33 PM EST













 




























































  Bar Harbor Bankshares (NYSE MKT: BHB) (or "Bar Harbor"), the holding company for Bar Harbor Bank & Trust, has successfully completed its merger with Lake Sunapee Bank Group (or "Lake Sunapee"), the holding company for Lake Sunapee Bank. The company is now the only community bank headquartered in Northern New England with a market footprint in all three Northern New England states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.  "The merger creates value for shareholders, customers and employees by creating efficiencies and strategic growth opportunities, allowing the combined organization to draw on various customer service, product, and technological strengths. The very compatible cultures of the two companies make the partnership a natural fit," said Curtis C. Simard, President and CEO of Bar Harbor Bankshares. "The combined institution brings significant lending capacity and growing product development yet will remain focused on its responsibility to be an active participant in, and advocate for, community growth and prosperity."  As a division of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust, Lake Sunapee Bank branches will continue to operate under the Lake Sunapee Bank name and William J. McIver, former Chief Operating Officer of Lake Sunapee, will continue with the combined company as Executive Vice President - Regional President, New Hampshire and Vermont Markets. Lake Sunapee Bank's subsidiaries, McCrillis & Eldredge Insurance and Charter Trust Company will operate as subsidiaries of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust. Lake Sunapee directors Steven H. Dimick, Stephen W. Ensign and Stephen R. Theroux have been appointed to Bar Harbor's board of directors.  "This historic partnership is a milestone for community banking in Northern New England. Both companies are enthusiastic to continue as a combined organization and to build on the reputations previously developed, sharing a focus on community involvement and outstanding customer service," said Simard.  Approved by shareholders in October, 2016, Bar Harbor's acquisition of Lake Sunapee grows the company to over $3 billion in assets, making it one of the largest community banks in Northern New England, with 49 branch locations across the three states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.

      risk; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in 
      interest rates and capital markets; inflation; customer acceptance of

How does the Annual Paid Membership and Free 30 Day Trial work?


The Membership
By joining Thrive Market as an annual member, you’ll be joining hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country who are already enjoying wholesome products at wholesale prices. Because of the membership, we don’t have to mark up our products like other retailers and can pass along those savings to our members. As a result, the average member makes back their $59.95 annual membership fee (that’s just $5/month) in savings in just 2 orders. For each paid membership, Thrive Market provides a free membership to a family in need, teacher, veteran, or first responder. Together we can make healthy options affordable and accessible to everyone.


The Free 30 Day Trial
We’re so confident in the value of the annual membership, that we let new shoppers try Thrive Market for free for the first 30 days. We’ve found overwhelmingly that this allows first time Thrivers to shop, discover, save, and quickly see the value of becoming an annual paid member at just $59.95 for the full year.

Is your question more specific?

Yes
No


We're glad this helped and resolved your issue





What is Thrive Gives?


Thrive Gives is our way of making healthy living affordable and accessible to everyone. We understand that paying our annual membership fee may not be possible for everyone, so for every paid membership we sell, we give a free membership to someone in need. Thrive Market members and Thrive Gives members enjoy the same access to wholesome products at wholesale prices. We distribute these free memberships through our Thrive Gives program and our nonprofit partners. Learn more  here.

Is your question more specific?

Yes
No

From there, you can invite friends to join by email, Facebook, or by copying and sharing your unique referral link. For each person you invite who becomes a paid member, you'll earn $25 in Thrive Cash. There is no limit to the number of friends you can invite to join—the more the merrier!
