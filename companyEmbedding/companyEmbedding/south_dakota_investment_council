What are analysts saying about Greif Bros. Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Greif Bros. Corporation stock: 
1. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We are below guidance on both FY17 adj. EPS and FCF." (6/8/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Greif reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 earnings per share (EPS) to range between $2.78 and $3.08. Going forward, Greif’s results will benefit from its Transformation plan. Reduction of unplanned downtime, sale of non-core assets, strong liquidity position and share repurchases will also aid results. The company’s share price performance has significantly outperformed the containers-metal glass industry over the past one year. However, sluggish global industrial economy, poor containerboard prices, a strong U.S. dollar and weaker-than-expected seasonal agricultural sales will remain major headwinds for Greif. Again, significant impairment and restructuring charges will hurt its earnings. Further, the company continues to see a very broad slowdown in China. The company has a negative record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (5/26/2017)
3. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "BMO recently hosted Greif's CEO Pete Watson and CFO Larry Hilsheimer for a series of investor meetings in NYC and Chicago. After several years of poor performance and management missteps, there is clear evidence of a turnaround under the new leadership of Pete Watson. As GEF pivots focus to inorganic growth, discipline around valuation is critical. A right acquisition at the right price could create a lot of shareholder value and increase confidence in the management ' but, they need to execute. Boosting price target to $53." (3/20/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Donaldson Company (NYSE:DCI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $47.00 (1.24% downside)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Avon Products (NYSE:AVP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $5.90 (63.89% upside)
