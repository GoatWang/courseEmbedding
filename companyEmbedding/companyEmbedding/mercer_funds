Risks


Equity funds are primarily subject to all the investment risks associated with underlying stocks. Stocks have shown greater growth potential than other types of securities, but they have also shown greater volatility and risk of loss. Investments made in small- or mid-cap stocks are generally more volatile and subject to greater risk. Investments made in foreign or emerging markets are subject to special risks that are not normally associated with domestic investment, including possible adverse currency fluctuations and political, social, and economic risks. There can be no assurance that any fund will achieve its objective.
Fixed income funds are primarily subject to all the investment risks associated with the underlying bonds and other fixed-income securities. Bonds are subject to interest rate and credit risk. As interest rates rise, the value of a Bond Fund can go down and an investor can lose principal. Investments made in high yield bonds are subject to greater volatility and potential loss of principal. Investments made in foreign and emerging market bonds are subject to special risks that are not normally associated with domestic investment, including possible adverse currency fluctuations and political, social and economic risks. There can be no assurance that any fund will achieve its objective.
The Mercer Core Fixed Income Fund, Mercer Opportunistic Fixed Income Fund and the Mercer Global Low Volatility Equity Fund may invest in more aggressive investments such as derivatives, (futures, options, swaps) all of which may cause greater volatility and less liquidity. Derivatives are more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks. The Mercer Global Low Volatility Equity Fund relies on quantitative models, techniques and risk analyses employed by the Subadvisers which is designed to enhance potential return but if an error occurs, it could result in losses to the Fund.
Please carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing.

Mercer to launch retirement game changer





30-Oct-2014
By Kristen Crawford 

















Related Articles: Market flexibility key to enhancing super |  | 


Mercer has announced the launch of an innovative investment option expected to provide a solution to weaknesses in Australia’s current retirement income system.

According to Mercer’s latest research, 54 per cent of Australians expected to have less money than they needed for the lifestyle they desired in retirement, while one in four Australians would outlive their retirement savings by more than 10 years. 

Yesterday, Media Super and VicSuper were revealed as the first two industry funds set to take on Mercer’s new longevity solution product, LifetimePlus, early next quarter.

The company said its investment option was the world’s first pooled mortality investment fund, designed to protect more Australians against the risk of outliving their savings.

Mercer managing director and Pacific market leader David Anderson said retirement would be a financial challenge for many. 

“Life might be simple but comfortable for the first decade or so, but once savings run out the age pension will only provide about half the amount required for a ‘comfortable lifestyle’, according to ASFA (Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia),” Anderson said.

VicSuper chief executive Michael Dundon said he was impressed to witness such an innovative product development happening in the retirement income space.

“To ensure our members can maintain their desired lifestyles in retirement, we believe we must provide appropriate solutions which manage the risks they face, as well as providing for their income needs,” Dundon said.

“An adviser-led, income-layering approach to building a member’s retirement portfolio can provide the best outcome for our members.

“Using an innovative product suite is fundamental to this approach.” 

LifetimePlus is expected to be primarily delivered to consumers via financial advisers, since circumstances upon entering the longevity investment, including a member’s age and superannuation account balance, will directly determine the product’s suitability, effectiveness and productivity of their returns.

Mercer senior partner and senior actuary David Knox said the investor must have a retirement pension in order to enter the shared pooled investment.

Knox explained that what differentiated the option from others was that it was deliberately biased towards those who lived longest in order to give those members the sustained confidence that they would have enough savings to maintain their lifestyle until they died.

Apart from assessing the suitability of the product for each investor on a case-by-case basis, advisers will also be responsible for delivering imperative product information to members.  

Anderson said despite LifetimePlus initially only being delivered by financial planners, it could be expected to evolve over time, become a retail fund and eventually have the potential to be made directly available to consumers.

History[edit]
Started in the United States in 1937 as the employee benefits department of Marsh & McLennan, Inc., the company took the name of “William M. Mercer” in 1959, when Marsh & McLennan acquired William M. Mercer Limited, a Canadian firm founded by William Manson Mercer in Vancouver in 1945.[3] In 1959, Mercer became a wholly owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. In 2002, its name was changed to Mercer Human Resource Consulting.[4]
In 2004, the company acquired Houston, TX-based Synhrgy HR Technologies, a human resources technology and outsourcing services company.[2] Also in 2004, Mercer admitted giving the NYSE board a compensation report that contained "omissions and inaccuracies" that led to a $139.5 million pay package for former NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso. Mercer had been brought in to advise the stock exchange on Grasso's 2003 contract and his request for $139.5 million. The consultancy returned $440,000 in fees it collected from the NYSE and provided key documents in the lawsuit.[5]
In 2007, the company became simply "Mercer."[6] Also in 2007, Mercer acquired Höfer Vorsorge-Management, a German actuarial and retirement consulting firm. At the time, the acquisition reportedly gave Mercer the top market position in Germany.[7]

History[edit]
Started in the United States in 1937 as the employee benefits department of Marsh & McLennan, Inc., the company took the name of “William M. Mercer” in 1959, when Marsh & McLennan acquired William M. Mercer Limited, a Canadian firm founded by William Manson Mercer in Vancouver in 1945.[3] In 1959, Mercer became a wholly owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. In 2002, its name was changed to Mercer Human Resource Consulting.[4]
In 2004, the company acquired Houston, TX-based Synhrgy HR Technologies, a human resources technology and outsourcing services company.[2] Also in 2004, Mercer admitted giving the NYSE board a compensation report that contained "omissions and inaccuracies" that led to a $139.5 million pay package for former NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso. Mercer had been brought in to advise the stock exchange on Grasso's 2003 contract and his request for $139.5 million. The consultancy returned $440,000 in fees it collected from the NYSE and provided key documents in the lawsuit.[5]
In 2007, the company became simply "Mercer."[6] Also in 2007, Mercer acquired Höfer Vorsorge-Management, a German actuarial and retirement consulting firm. At the time, the acquisition reportedly gave Mercer the top market position in Germany.[7]
In 2008, Mercer's Italian human capital consulting business merged with Tesi, an Italian competitor. The combined business, Mercer Tesi was noted at the time to be the largest HR consultancy in Italy.[8]
In 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, an expert in international work assignments.[9] Also in 2010, Mercer acquired Brecksville, Ohio-based Innovative Process Administration LLC (IPA), a health benefits and technology provider.
In 2011, Mercer acquired Fort Lauderdale, FL-based Mahoney & Associates, a defined contribution plan provider.[10] Also in 2011, Mercer acquired Alicia Smith & Associates, a Washington DC-based Medicaid policy consulting firm.[11]
In 2013, Mercer acquired British Columbia-based Hall Consulting Limited (HCL), an HR consultant and salary surveyor focusing on the mining and energy business.[12] Also in 2013, Mercer acquired PricewaterhouseCoopers' pension windup (termination) administration business in Canada.[13] Also in 2013, Mercer acquired Global Remuneration Solutions (GRS), a South African compensation and benefits survey data and rewards information provider.[14]
In 2014, Mercer acquired Norwell, MA-based Transition Assist, a private health care exchange specializing in coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees.[15] Also in 2014, Mercer acquired Jeitosa Group International, a business and technology consultancy,[16] and acquired a 34% stake in South Africa-based employee benefits specialist Alexander Forbes.[17] Later that year, Mercer acquired Swiss private markets manager and consultant SCM,[18] and Denarius, a Santiago, Chile-based consulting firm focused on compensation and benefits survey and information products.[19]
In 2015, Mercer made two acquisitions. It acquired Hopkinton, MA-based Comptryx, a workforce metrics company offering surveying, modeling and analytics services,[20] and also acquired HRBS, a provider of career and talent consulting and information services to clients across Asia, with concentrated strength in Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China.[21]
Regions[edit]
Since January 2013 Mercer has been organized into three geographic regions, each with a regional president: North America, EuroPac (Europe + Pacific markets of Australia and New Zealand) and Growth Markets (Asia, Africa and Latin America). Headquarters for the North American region are in New York City, for EuroPac in London, and for Growth Markets in Singapore. Less than half of the organization’s employees are based in North America.[22]

History[edit]
Started in the United States in 1937 as the employee benefits department of Marsh & McLennan, Inc., the company took the name of “William M. Mercer” in 1959, when Marsh & McLennan acquired William M. Mercer Limited, a Canadian firm founded by William Manson Mercer in Vancouver in 1945.[3] In 1959, Mercer became a wholly owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. In 2002, its name was changed to Mercer Human Resource Consulting.[4]
In 2004, the company acquired Houston, TX-based Synhrgy HR Technologies, a human resources technology and outsourcing services company.[2] Also in 2004, Mercer admitted giving the NYSE board a compensation report that contained "omissions and inaccuracies" that led to a $139.5 million pay package for former NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso. Mercer had been brought in to advise the stock exchange on Grasso's 2003 contract and his request for $139.5 million. The consultancy returned $440,000 in fees it collected from the NYSE and provided key documents in the lawsuit.[5]
In 2007, the company became simply "Mercer."[6] Also in 2007, Mercer acquired Höfer Vorsorge-Management, a German actuarial and retirement consulting firm. At the time, the acquisition reportedly gave Mercer the top market position in Germany.[7]
In 2008, Mercer's Italian human capital consulting business merged with Tesi, an Italian competitor. The combined business, Mercer Tesi was noted at the time to be the largest HR consultancy in Italy.[8]
In 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, an expert in international work assignments.[9] Also in 2010, Mercer acquired Brecksville, Ohio-based Innovative Process Administration LLC (IPA), a health benefits and technology provider.
In 2011, Mercer acquired Fort Lauderdale, FL-based Mahoney & Associates, a defined contribution plan provider.[10] Also in 2011, Mercer acquired Alicia Smith & Associates, a Washington DC-based Medicaid policy consulting firm.[11]
In 2013, Mercer acquired British Columbia-based Hall Consulting Limited (HCL), an HR consultant and salary surveyor focusing on the mining and energy business.[12] Also in 2013, Mercer acquired PricewaterhouseCoopers' pension windup (termination) administration business in Canada.[13] Also in 2013, Mercer acquired Global Remuneration Solutions (GRS), a South African compensation and benefits survey data and rewards information provider.[14]
In 2014, Mercer acquired Norwell, MA-based Transition Assist, a private health care exchange specializing in coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees.[15] Also in 2014, Mercer acquired Jeitosa Group International, a business and technology consultancy,[16] and acquired a 34% stake in South Africa-based employee benefits specialist Alexander Forbes.[17] Later that year, Mercer acquired Swiss private markets manager and consultant SCM,[18] and Denarius, a Santiago, Chile-based consulting firm focused on compensation and benefits survey and information products.[19]
In 2015, Mercer made two acquisitions. It acquired Hopkinton, MA-based Comptryx, a workforce metrics company offering surveying, modeling and analytics services,[20] and also acquired HRBS, a provider of career and talent consulting and information services to clients across Asia, with concentrated strength in Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China.[21]
Regions[edit]
Since January 2013 Mercer has been organized into three geographic regions, each with a regional president: North America, EuroPac (Europe + Pacific markets of Australia and New Zealand) and Growth Markets (Asia, Africa and Latin America). Headquarters for the North American region are in New York City, for EuroPac in London, and for Growth Markets in Singapore. Less than half of the organization’s employees are based in North America.[22]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
