VM1000 - Vesper
















































VM1000
Piezoelectric MEMS Microphone
Create the most acoustically rich consumer products for all sound environments.
From smartphones and wearables to smart home devices, consumers use sound-enabled products in the real world. That’s why MEMS microphones have to work in real-world environments, not just some of the time, but all of the time. Vesper’s VM1000 does just that.








Robust and Reliable
As the industry’s first piezoelectric MEMS microphone, VM1000 is the most robust and reliable MEMS microphone for consumer products.
It is waterproof, dustproof, particle-resistant and shockproof so you can immerse it in water, bathe it in dust, expose it to particulate matter or drop it on the ground, and it keeps working properly. It’s a microphone on which you can depend. And although your customers won’t recognize it with their bare eyes, they will appreciate it with their ears.

Exceptionally Stable
Consumers want far-field audio applications in smartphones and in IoT devices.
They want to record from across the room and use voice to control their smart TV. It is far-field audio applications like these that are making microphone arrays so popular, but there’s a problem: Microphone arrays require microphones that are carefully matched in terms of phase and sensitivity.
Here again, capacitive MEMS microphones fall down. Once they leave the factory floor, they are prone to “drift,” so their performance is unstable. As a piezoelectric MEMS microphone, VM1000 uses a much simpler and more consistent manufacturing process as well as easier, less expensive ASIC calibration — ensuring that phase and sensitivity are well matched. Very stable over time and in harsh environments, VM1000 microphones in an array always stay matched in all environmental conditions.







Ambient Noise Cancellation and Audio Zoom
As a very high SNR microphone, VM1000 delivers an acoustically rich experience for a range of applications.

VM1000 offers better ambient noise cancellation, so phone calls and recordings sound clearer. It also provides superior “audio zoom” – giving consumers more accurate sound-selection when they are recording.




Technical Specifications
VM1000 is an omnidirectional, single-ended analog output MEMS microphone.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

About VM1010
VM1010 is a low-noise, high dynamic range, single-ended analog output piezoelectric MEMS microphone. It features a configurable voice zone, allowing voice in a 5-foot radius to 20-foot radius-zone to trigger the system and increase to a normal operation mode. When the environment is quiet, the system can enter ZeroPower Listening mode and the entire system can power down.
Like other Vesper piezoelectric MEMS microphones, VM1010 sets the standard for reliability and stability, even in harsh environments. It is dustproof to IP5X and waterproof to IPX7. Because it is stable in all environments, VM1010 microphones are also ideally suited to microphone arrays, which are critical to far-field audio applications.
Drawing a mere 6 µA of power in always-listening mode, VM1010 extends battery life by >10x.

Technology - Vesper















































Technology






Out with the old, in with the new.


Designers have used capacitive MEMS microphones in their smartphones, tablets, laptops and digital cameras for almost 20 years. Even though they use silicon processing, capacitive MEMS microphones operate using the same physical principle as condenser-style microphones that have been around for almost 100 years. They measure sound with a capacitor (condenser) made of a flexible diaphragm and a rigid backplate. As multi-membrane capacitive structures, they trap air in between layers, which prevents the sound transducer from moving freely in response to sound pressure, limiting performance.
In contrast, piezoelectric MEMS microphones do not trap a stiff air mass between two plates: Vesper’s diaphragm can move freely in response to sound waves to capture the maximum signal and provide better performance.
The old capacitive MEMS microphones are prone to reliability issues as well. Water, dust, solder flux vapors and other common contaminants can damage them so they lose up to 80% of their signal or stop working altogether. Microphone-matching is more time-consuming because of part-to-part variation, which requires hand-calibration of microphones once they leave the production line.


Vesper uses piezoelectric materials to create the most advanced MEMS microphones on the market. This is a marked shift from capacitive MEMS microphones because piezoelectric microphones operate upon a completely different physical phenomenon – the direct conversion of mechanical sound energy into electrical energy.
Vesper’s piezoelectric design is a single diaphragm that is immune to dust, water, solder flux vapors and other similar environmental contaminants. In fact, Vesper’s has the world’s only MEMS microphones rated at IP68, making them the most waterproof MEMS microphone available. And unlike capacitive MEMS microphones, which require sound-muffling waterproof meshes and protective layers to have a chance against water, our microphones don’t require special packaging, so they preserve acoustic integrity.

How It Works
Vesper uses piezoelectric cantilever structures as our sound transducer, eliminating the dual- or triple-membrane layer structures used in capacitive devices.

Vesper uses piezoelectric cantilever structures as our sound transducer, eliminating the dual- or triple-membrane layer structures used in capacitive devices. As single-layer devices, piezoelectric structures can move freely in response to sounds to create the highest fidelity signal possible. As a result, Vesper microphones provide very high SNR. This means that our microphones can capture sound clearly and at great distances while remaining immune to dust, particles or water.
 







 


Here’s how all other MEMS microphones work.





 


Here’s how Vesper’s microphone works.











Minimizing Part-to-Part Variation
In addition, our piezoelectric MEMS microphones utilize a proven, highly reliable and controlled manufacturing process and material, Aluminum Nitride, which major semiconductor companies have used to ship billions of RF filters for mobile phones. 
This tight manufacturing process control means that our microphones are remarkably consistent in manufacturing with little variation from microphone to microphone. This improved matching makes our devices more suitable for large arrays.

Technology changes, but the natural human preference for communicating by voice is constant. As the number of electronic devices in our world grows, our need for natural communication is even greater. And whether we are communicating with people or machines, the quality and reliability of the voice interface becomes increasingly critical. Microphones are the gateway between the digital world and the natural world of human voice.
Vesper’ mission is to dramatically improve the reliability of the voice user interface for smartphones, smart speakers, connected automobiles and any connected device using our proprietary piezoelectric MEMS technology invented by our founders at the University of Michigan.
The Piezoelectric Difference
Vesper piezoelectric microphones operate on a completely different physical principle from all other MEMS and electret condenser-style audio devices. Using the piezoelectric effect, first discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie, Vesper’s MEMS microphones directly convert sound wave energy into an electrical signal.
Beyond just delivering an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Vesper microphones are stably matched, making them uniquely suited for large array applications in smartphones, tablets, smart home devices and other connected products. Vesper’s are the most durable, waterproof, shockproof, and both dust- and particle-resistant microphones on the market.
