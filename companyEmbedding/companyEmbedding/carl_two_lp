Shipping & Return Policy


 



 
Return Policy
Your satisfaction is our top priority. We guarantee the quality of our products and we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchases. If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, we will be happy to exchange the item for you to better meet your needs and tastes. You can return the purchased items within 14 days of receipt for an exchange or full refund/Credit (less shipping charges) subject to Return Conditions.
We are always striving to make the Return and Exchange process as easy and hassle-free for you as possible. It is simple, providing you follow our Return and Exchange Instructions. Please contact our fully trained team of Return Specialists should you have further questions.
Return Conditions
Items must be returned in NEW (unused, untested, and resalable) condition, in the original manufacturer packaging, with all accessories, kit components, promotional items and instruction manuals included. For your protection, items must be returned shipping prepaid, insured for the full value and safely wrapped to prevent shipping damage.
Generally, as a “rule-of-thumb" you return the items to us the same way we sent them to you - in the same condition and with all the original contents.
We do not accept returns or exchanges on customized orders. All charges related to the return of items to CARL MFG. USA, Inc. are the responsibility of the customer.
Restocking Fees
There is no restocking fee for returns of unopened, unused, and untested items returned within 14 days. Please keep in mind that restrictions apply. A restocking fee of 15% will be applied to returns of opened, used, or damaged products to cover our processing, packing and shipping expenses. Additional fees may apply if the item is not returned in its original packaging.
We reserve the right to charge a restocking fee of up to 15% for the return of resalable items outside of the policy stated here.
Exchanges
If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, we will be happy to exchange it for you. Please return the item to us within 14 days and experience no restocking fees, providing the item is in NEW (unopened, unused, untested and resalable) condition. Please follow the simple steps outlined in Return and Exchange Instructions.
Exchanges In Case Of Shipping Damage
If an item comes damaged as a result of shipping, we will be happy to exchange it for you.
