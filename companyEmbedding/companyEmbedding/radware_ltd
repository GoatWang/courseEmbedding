Radware: Poised For Growth - Radware Ltd. (NASDAQ:RDWR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Radware: Poised For GrowthApr. 6.15 | About: Radware Ltd. (RDWR) Simple Investment Ideas Long/short equity, value, Growth, growth at reasonable priceSummaryRadware is well-positioned in the virtual/cloud application delivery and security industry.Radware's technological edge and strong market positioning should propel the company moving forward.While Radware has already experienced tremendous growth in the past few years, the company still has immense upside potential.Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR) is a leading provider of application delivery and security for virtual/cloud data centers. With the growing popularity of virtual/cloud services, performance optimization and cybersecurity in this arena is becoming more important than ever. Radware has carved out a sizable niche for itself in this arena, with its products/services growing in popularity over the past few years. With society's rapidly accelerating digitization, companies like Radware will become more relevant than ever. In fact, Radware's valuation grew multiple times over the past few years alone, highlighting the growth nature of the company.
Radware not only maximizes IT efficiency for customers but also provides industry-leading IT security in an increasingly dangerous cyber environment. With IT efficiency and security increasing in importance for business enterprises in particular, Radware's application delivery/load balancing solutions and DDoS protection have proven to be invaluable for many customers. The rise of virtual/cloud-based services and the unprecedented increase in the number of DDoS attacks have provided Radware with a huge growth opportunity. Given Radware's technological edge and current market positioning, the company should see additional upside moving forward.
Technological Leadership
Radware is one of the technological leaders on the increasingly popular virtual and cloud computing front, partnering with some of the biggest names in the space (i.e. VMware (NYSE:VMW), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), etc). The company has developed some of the most sophisticated and technologically advanced hardware and software products in its industry and continues to innovate at a quick pace. The company sells products/solutions for application delivery/load balancing, network security, management/monitoring, virtualization, application integration and so on.

Radware has nearly the entire virtual/cloud computing apparatus covered, making it not only one of the most technologically-advanced companies in the space but also one of the most well diversified. In order the keep its edge, the company is constantly improving its flagship product lines or coming up with new technologies. In the past quarter, for instance, the company released new iterations of its well known Alteon product line, which specializes in application delivery/load balancing. The company released two new application delivery controllers (Alteon 8420 and Alteon NFV) for high-end data centers and mobile carriers, which has firmly cemented the company's position as one of the leading IT optimization companies on the virtual/cloud front.
Here is a look at Radware's new Alteon 8420.

Source: Radware
On Radware's application security side, the company has continued to prove its effectiveness in providing top-notch customer security. The company's attack mitigation solution, for instance, has successfully blocked many major cyber attacks over the past quarter, proving to be one of the few security technologies capable of keeping up with the fast-paced cyber environment. With the ever increasing frequency of cyber attacks, Radware has done a great job of providing relevant cybersecurity monitoring, prevention and mitigation services. The company's cybersecurity products, such as its Cyber Security Mitigation Architecture, has proven to be extremely effective in protecting customers from cyber threats.
As one of the first movers in extensive cloud security, Radware has taken advantage of its early entrance into this industry through continual innovation. Over the past quarter, the company introduced yet another cloud cybersecurity solution called Radware Cloud WAF, which is the industry's only hybrid web application firewall that unifies application security across private data centers and the cloud. On top of this, Radware has even started offering 24/7 cloud cybersecurity services, which is not surprising given the increasing around-the-clock cyber threats.

Market Positioning
Radware continues to cement its status as a leading applications delivery and cybersecurity firm. With the increasing relevance of the company's entire business profile, old and new customers are starting to more completely utilize Radware's services. For instance, customers are more frequently using both the company's application delivery solutions and its numerous security solutions. With businesses' rising IT optimization and cybersecurity needs, this trend will likely continue on into the future.
Radware also is expanding its presence in the North American market, with sales growing approximately 50% on a YOY basis. With the increasing frequency of North American DDoS attacks, Radware is well positioned to tackle this problem. The U.S. market has been extremely important for Radware and will continue to be one of the company's largest markets moving forward. After all, the U.S. market is the fastest adopter of new technologies, which is clearly reflected in Radware's U.S. business subscriptions. While the company's North American business has been booming, its international business also has been doing extremely well.
Radware saw notable growth in the APAC and EMEA regions, which is not surprising given these regions' rapid technological progress. While recent growth in the United States has largely been driven by the proliferation of cloud providers, traditional carriers are still driving growth on the international stage. This distinction between cloud providers and traditional carriers is more ambiguous on the international stage though as their traditional carriers are oftentimes also the largest cloud providers. Regardless of the specifics, Radware has clearly been cementing its place as one of the premier global delivery applications and cyber security IT firms.
Financials
Radware has shown tremendous growth recently, with its net income nearly tripling over the past four years from $9.63M in 2010 to $24.95M in 2014. What's more, the company continues to experience extremely high non-GAAP gross margins in the 80% range, which is high even in the virtual/cloud IT services industry. With virtual/cloud optimization services becoming more popular, and cyber threats becoming more prevalent, it would not be surprising to see Radware's net income growth accelerate moving forward. In fact, the company recorded one of its highest revenues this past quarter at $61M, which represented a 7% sequential increase. With the burgeoning virtual/cloud services space, Radware's balance sheet should only grow stronger moving forward.

Risks
While Radware has firmly cemented itself as a leading virtual/cloud IT product and service provider, the company is still not completely safe from volatility. The cyber industry is notoriously volatile, be it in service optimization or security, and Radware is by no means immune to this. Despite this volatility risk, the company has proven its ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving IT landscape and has developed strong partnerships with leading IT companies. These two factors alone should help drastically reduce its volatility risk and better position Radware in the industry.
Conclusion
With the IT trend clearly moving toward virtualization and cloud computing, Radware is extremely well-positioned moving forward. At a market capitalization of $1B, the company has large upside potential. Despite the company' high P/E ratio of 39, its growth potential, technological edge and market positioning more than justify this metric. Radware is poised for growth in the promising virtual/cloud computing solutions industry.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
