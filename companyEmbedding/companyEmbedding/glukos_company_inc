New GLUKOS Protein Bars And Powders Deliver Results Faster Than Any Other Protein On The Market

Whey Protein Isolate Bars and Powders Utilize Glucose For Rapid Delivery and Quick Recovery




Feb 16, 2016, 10:00am EST














PHOENIX, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The GLUKOS Company Inc., an all-natural sports nutrition brand, today announced the launch of its groundbreaking protein bars and powders, which deliver protein into the bloodstream faster and more effectively than any product in the crowded protein market. 
Constructed with high-quality whey protein isolate, GLUKOS' protein bars and powders utilize Glucose - the "good" sugar - and contain no sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweetener, color or flavoring. Glucose is known as the "good" sugar because it fuels all human, plant and animal life on Earth with instant, natural energy. This characteristic makes it the most efficient catalyst to drive GLUKOS Protein into the muscles for a quicker, more effective recovery.  
"Knowing the protein market is saturated with ambiguous claims and unrecognizable ingredients, we had to provide consumers with a clear differentiator and believe Glucose provides us with the edge," said Mick McCormick, President and CEO, GLUKOS Company Inc. "Similar to our energy product, the utilization of Glucose in our new protein is an absolute game changer, but, just as important, our bars and powders taste better than any protein on the market."
Following any physical activity the body provides an optimal 30-minute anabolic window where the muscles become sponge-like and need nutrients, specifically protein, for recovery and growth. Knowing the body requires a protein to be combined with a carbohydrate for absorption, Founder Mark Jensen paired Glucose, the fastest carbohydrate, with whey protein isolate to speed up the delivery process, which in turn allows the muscles to recover quicker. 
GLUKOS protein is unlike plant-based proteins, because it uses the whey protein isolate that incorporates more of the essential amino acids for optimal muscle recovery and growth. Unlike maltodextrin and sucralose-based products that create byproducts such as lactic acid and triglycerides, GLUKOS avoids those harmful side effects through its use of Glucose. 
In addition to the science-based efficacy of GLUKOS' new line of protein bars and powders, taste plays a critical role in providing a point of differentiation for consumers. With only a few ingredients in the bars and powders, GLUKOS tastes great, yet still outperforms its leading competitors. Available in three flavors – Chocolate Peanut Butter, Cookies N' Crème and Rocky Road – GLUKOS protein bars are under 200 calories with 15 Grams of protein per bar. The protein powder is available in two flavors – Chocolate and Vanilla – providing 21 grams of protein and 120 calories in a serving. 
In addition to GLUKOS Protein Powders and Bars, GLUKOS energy is available in six different delivery mechanisms, including ready-to drinks, gels, powders, tablets, gummies and bars. For more information on GLUKOS protein, including where to purchase product, please visit GlukosEnergy.com or check out Facebook and Twitter.
GLUKOS Company Inc.GLUKOS is a natural energy foods brand that provides the ultimate source of natural energy and protein for athletes to perform at their optimal levels. Whether an athlete is training or participating in sport, GLUKOS is the ultimate pre- during- and post-workout energy source that absorbs into the bloodstream instantaneously providing twice the energy twice as fast as any other energy product on the market, and protein source that drives protein into the muscles for the fastest recovery formula available. Developed by triathlete and former collegiate runner Mark Jensen, GLUKOS energy is available in six different delivery mechanisms, including ready to drink, powder, gel, gummy, tablet and bars, and GLUKOS protein is available in two different delivery mechanisms, powder and bars.

                    WATCH: THE SCIENCE OF GLUKOS

Moving sport fuel forward



                        GLUKOS is made with glucose—the form of energy used by all life on earth, and the only energy
                        your body can really use. The more strenuous the activity, the more glucose your body requires. GLUKOS
                        gives your body the fuel it needs to perform at its best.
                    

                        *THE GLYCEMIC INDEX: The GI represents the total rise in a person's blood sugar level (fuel) following
                        consumption of food or drink. The measurement definition is milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The American
                        Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70-130 mg/dL and after meals less than 180
                        mg/dL.

                        *THE GLYCEMIC INDEX: The GI represents the total rise in a person's blood sugar level (fuel) following
                        consumption of food or drink. The measurement definition is milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The American
                        Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70-130 mg/dL and after meals less than 180
                        mg/dL.
                    







            Unlike other sports products, GLUKOS provides almost instant energy. It passes through the
            cell wall of your mouth where it enters directly into the bloodstream. 
        






Nothing movesyou faster

                        Other sport fuels use inferior sugars like fructose and sucrose that have
                        to be digested before they can provide any benefit. This process wastes valuable
                        time, and even robs your body of energy.
                    









Glucose

                                Absorbed immediately
                                (starts in mouth)
                            





                                Results in:

                                    Instant energy
                                







Sucrose & Fructose

                                Digested in the intestines
                            





                                Results in:

                                    Delayed absorption and
                                    by-products Triglycerides (fat)
                                    and Lactic Acid
                                










            GLUKOS gives your body A pure, sustained source of fuel. So if you want
            to push yourself to the limit GLUKOS can help you go the distance.
        






                        There’s a lot more science where that came from
