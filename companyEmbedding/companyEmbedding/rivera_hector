Product Description
Hector Rivera was probably the most underrated Salsa-pianist.
Mostly know for his “boogaloo”-hit “At the Party” (also available at latinscores.com), this one is one of my personal favorites.
So simple but so effective. A definite floor filler.
Suitable for beginners to advanced players and a great workshop tune.
