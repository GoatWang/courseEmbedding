                Ramsey, Chris — Knot Head
            
Somerset, KY



Products

turned hats, mirrors, bowls





Beginning with a rough-hewn solid block of wood from a felled tree in Kentucky, Chris Ramsey places the block on a lathe which rotates the wood at a selected speed. Chris sculpts the “blank” into a hat that weighs only 7 to 9 ounces and can be comfortably worn, or into a bowl or other form. All of Ramsey’s art works are crafted from a single, unique piece of wood with no gluing or joining of individual pieces. All pieces are durable and have twenty coats of lacquer applied over a period of days, followed by hand sanding. 
 
Chris’s work can be found at the Kentucky Museum of Art & Craft, Louisville, KY; and at the Kentucky Artisan Center, Berea, KY.

Retire Inspired - Overview
When you hear the word retirement, you probably don't imagine yourself scrambling to pay your bills in your golden years. But for too many Americans, that's the fate that awaits unless they take steps now to plan for the future.
Whether you’re twenty-five and starting your first job or fifty-five and watching the career clock start to wind down, today is the day to get serious about your retirement.
In Retire Inspired, #1 National Best-Selling Author, Chris Hogan  teaches that retirement isn’t an age; it’s a financial number—an amount you need to live the life in retirement that you’ve always dreamed of. With clear investing concepts and strategies, Chris will educate and empower you to make your own investing decisions, set reasonable expectations for your spouse and family, and build a dream team of experts to get you there.



Accolades
Chris Hogan has done the impossible—written a book on investing for retirement without losing his audience in a fog of boring jargon. He explains the concepts using concrete and practical examples, and he shows how everyone can enjoy a great retirement, not just the wizards of Wall Street. No matter where you are on the retirement journey, this book could drastically improve your future. 
	
— Art Laffer
Chariman of Laffer Associates and founder of the Laffer Curve


Too many people are bringing debt and regret into their retirement years. That's a tragedy that could—and should—be avoided. Retire Inspired can show anyone, at any age and any income, the steps to achieve their retirement dreams. 
    
— Robert Herjavec
Co-host of Shark Tank and CEO of Herjavec Group


Here's what Chris Hogan gets about retirement that other people miss: your wishes will remain wishes until you put a plan in place to attack them. Hogan learned from his mentor Dave Ramsey how to do just that. In this book, he passes that wisdom on to you. 
    
— Jean Chatzky
Best-selling author and AARP Financial Ambassador


This book not only provides useful information on retirement, but it also tackles subjects that all of us need to address as we near that stage of life, like estate planning, living trusts, changing your investment portfolio, and talking to your aging parents about money. This is simply the best book for anyone who wants to make the most of their retirement years.
    
— John C. Maxwell
New York Times best-selling author


As president of my own firm and a financial professional, I truly believe this is the only book you should consider as your guide to retirement. Chris Hogan takes Dave Ramsey's timeless wisdom on money and digs further into the specifics of retiring well and leaving a legacy. He guides you step-by-step in how to comfortably and confidently make the enormous life transition into retirement. This book is a gold mine of resources and advice that I would recommend to anyone!

Call 24/7 Legal.  Get Help Now.WebsiteContact UsMore InfoDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glassDid You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer

There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations.
