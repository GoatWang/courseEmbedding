April 2005    Dear SVS Focus Value+Growth Portfolio Shareholder:    Recently, you received a Prospectus/Proxy Statement regarding the proposed merger of SVS Focus Value+Growth Portfolio with Growth and Income Portfolio. If approved by
shareholders, this merger will take place May 2, 2005 or shortly thereafter.    Enclosed is a prospectus supplement for Growth and Income Portfolio that reflects a change in the portfolio management team for the portfolio.    Portfolio managers Gregory Adams and Andrew Brudenell are leaving Deutsche Asset Management (DeAM) to pursue other opportunities. Replacing Gregory and Andrew,
respectively, as lead portfolio manager and manager of Growth and Income Portfolio, will be Theresa Gusman and Greg Sivin. Both bring a wealth of industry experience to the fund and we are pleased to welcome them aboard.    Nothing will change with Growth and Income Portfolio’s investment objective. It will
continue to seek long-term growth of capital, current income and growth of income.    What will change is the process that the portfolio management team will use when selecting the stocks in which Growth and Income Portfolio invests. Using criteria specifically designed for the fund by the advisor, as well as the fund’s
investment parameters and risk management considerations, a quantitative model will compile the top U.S. equity research recommendations from the advisor’s U.S. equity analysts into a proposed list of stocks for the portfolio and will suggest
appropriate weightings for each stock. The portfolio management team will make adjustments where necessary to the stocks and weightings for each stock in the portfolio and buy and sell securities in accordance with the model’s recommendations.
   Please remember that Scudder Growth and Income Portfolio is subject to stock
market risk, meaning stocks in the fund may decline in value for extended periods of time due to the activities and financial prospects of individual companies, or due to general market and economic conditions. Please read the fund’s prospectus
for specific information regarding its risk profile.    View a prospectus    To obtain a
prospectus, contact Scudder Insurance Products Sales Support at (800) 778-1482. The prospectus contains complete details on investment objectives, risk, fees charges and expenses, as well as other information about the investment company, which
should be carefully considered. The prospectus contains this and other important information on the product and underlying portfolios. Product and/or product features may not be available in all states, at all firms or at all times.
   We look forward to
serving all of your investment needs for many years to come. Should you have any questions, please contact Scudder Insurance Products Sales Support at (800) 778-1482.    Sincerely,    Scudder Distributors, Inc.    Scudder Investments is part of Deutsche Asset Management, which is the marketing name in the US for the asset management activities of Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Asset
Management Inc., Deutsche Asset Management Investment Services Ltd., Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. and Scudder Trust Company.    NOT FDIC/NCUA INSURED. MAY LOSE VALUE  NO BANK GUARANTEE. NOT A DEPOSIT  NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY    37654 (4/05) SVSIIFV+G ANNUITY 


   Scudder Variable Series I   


o
Scudder Growth and Income Portfolio    Supplement to the currently effective prospectuses    The following information replaces the disclosure for the portfolio in “The portfolio managers” section of the prospectuses:    The people listed below handle the day-to-day management of the portfolio.   






 Theresa Gusman
 
Gregory Y. Sivin, CFA




Managing Director of Deutsche Asset Management and Lead Portfolio Manager of the portfolio.
 
Vice President of Deutsche Asset Management and Portfolio Manager of the portfolio.




 o       Joined Deutsche Asset Management in 1995 and the portfolio in 2005.
 
 o       Joined Deutsche Asset Management in 2000 and the portfolio in 2005.




 o       Head of equity research for Americas; head of global equity research team for materials: New
York.
 
 o       Head of the equity portfolio analytics team for active equity: New York.




 o       Over 21 years of investment industry
experience.   o       B.A., State University of New York at Stony Brook.
 
 o       Previously, six years of experience as senior
associate/quantitative analyst of small cap research for Prudential Securities, group coordinator/research analyst in the investment banking division for Goldman Sachs & Co. and senior actuarial assistant in the commercial property group for
Insurance Services Office.  

 
 o       B.S., State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   The following information replaces
paragraphs 2-5 for the portfolio in “The Portfolio’s Main Investment Strategy” section of the prospectuses:    The portfolio seeks to bring together the top US equity research recommendations of the advisor into a single investment portfolio. In managing the portfolio, each of the
advisor’s US equity analysts individually assigns qualitative ratings to stocks under their coverage using bottom-up analysis and looking for companies with strong prospects for continued growth of capital and earnings. Using criteria
specifically designed for the portfolio by the advisor, as well as the investment parameters of the portfolio and risk management considerations, a quantitative model compiles these research analyst ratings into a proposed list of stocks for the
portfolio and suggests appropriate weightings for each stock.    Making
adjustments where necessary, the managers normally will buy and sell securities in accordance with the model’s, and hence the research analysts’, recommendations. In addition to the risk management criteria inherent in the portfolio
construction process, the managers use analytical tools to monitor the 




risk profile of the portfolio relative to comparable portfolios, and appropriate benchmarks and peer groups.            Please Retain This Supplement for Future Reference      April 1, 2005  SVS1-3605

    R-1843-8 (12/16) Additional Performance InformationFund performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Important Objectives, Strategy and Risk InformationThe fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. Looking for a solid middle ground? Mid-cap companies combine the attributes of their large- and small-cap peers: Many have established name recognition and products, but are in the prime growth phase of their business cycle. At the same time, they may be nimble enough to respond quickly to product innovations and changes in the marketplace. With Deutsche Mid Cap Value Fund, you can gain access to mid-cap stocks with compelling valuations.Any fund that focuses in a particular segment of the market or region of the world will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. Stocks of medium-sized companies involve greater risk than securities of larger, more-established companies. The fund may lend securities to approved institutions. Stocks may decline in value.

For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Manager Biography Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard PricingDeutsche Variable Series I Capital Growth VIPInvestment ObjectiveReturn to TopThe fund seeks to provide long-term growth of capital.
Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard PricingDeutsche Variable Series I Capital Growth VIPPrincipal Investment StrategiesReturn to TopMain investments. The fund normally invests at least 65% of total assets in equities, mainly common stocks of US companies. The fund generally focuses on established companies that are similar in size to the companies in the S&P 500® Index (generally 500 of the largest companies in the US) or the Russell 1000® Growth Index (generally those stocks among the 1,000 largest US companies that have relatively higher price-to-earnings ratios and higher forecasted growth values). While the market capitalization ranges of the S&P 500® Index and the Russell 1000® Growth Index change throughout the year, as of February 28, 2017 the market capitalization range of the S&P 500® Index was between $2.5 billion and $730.5 billion and the market capitalization range of the Russell 1000® Growth Index was between $89.2 million and $637.7 billion.The S&P 500® Index is rebalanced quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September and December. The Russell 1000® Growth Index is reconstituted annually every June. Although the fund can invest in companies of any size, the fund intends to invest primarily in companies whose market capitalizations fall within the normal range of these indexes. The fund may also invest in other types of equity securities such as preferred stocks or convertible securities. The fund may also invest to a limited extent in companies outside the US.
Management process. Portfolio management aims to add value through stock selection. In choosing securities, portfolio management employs a risk-balanced bottom-up selection process to identify companies it believes are well-positioned and that have above average and sustainable growth potential.
Portfolio management utilizes a proprietary investment process designed to identify attractive investments by utilizing proprietary research conducted by in-house analysts. The investment process also takes into consideration various valuation metrics to assess the attractiveness of stocks and assists portfolio management in devising allocations among investable securities.
All investment decisions are made within risk parameters set by portfolio management. Portfolio management may favor different types of securities from different industries and companies at different times.
Portfolio management will normally sell a stock when its price fully reflects portfolio management’s estimate of its fundamental value, its fundamentals have deteriorated, other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the fund’s exposure to a given sector.
Derivatives. Portfolio management generally may use futures contracts, which are a type of derivative (a contract whose value is based on, for example, indices, currencies or securities), as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class, to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or for other needs while maintaining exposure to the stock market.
The fund may also use other types of derivatives (i) for hedging purposes; (ii) for risk management; (iii) for non-hedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains; or (iv) as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions.
Securities Lending. The fund may lend securities (up to one-third of total assets) to approved institutions.
Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard PricingDeutsche Variable Series I Capital Growth VIPPrincipal Investment RisksReturn to TopAn investment in the Fund is subject to the following risks which are described in more detail in the Statutory Prospectus.
There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund’s performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund’s performance to trail that of other investments. The fund may not achieve its investment objective, and is not intended to be a complete investment program. An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.
Stock market risk. When stock prices fall, you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well. Stock prices can be hurt by poor management on the part of the stock’s issuer, shrinking product demand and other business risks. These may affect single companies as well as groups of companies. In addition, movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stock’s price, regardless of how well the company performs. The market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes, which could affect the fund's ability to sell them at an attractive price. To the extent the fund invests in a particular capitalization or sector, the fund’s performance may be affected by the general performance of that particular capitalization or sector.
Growth investing risk. As a category, growth stocks may underperform value stocks (and the stock market as a whole) over any period of time. Because the prices of growth stocks are based largely on the expectation of future earnings, growth stock prices can decline rapidly and significantly in reaction to negative news about such factors as earnings, the economy, political developments, or other news.
Security selection risk. The securities in the fund’s portfolio may decline in value. Portfolio management could be wrong in its analysis of industries, companies, economic trends, the relative attractiveness of different securities or other matters.
Medium-sized company risk. Medium-sized company stocks tend to be more volatile than large company stocks. Because stock analysts are less likely to follow medium-sized companies, less information about them is available to investors. Industry-wide reversals may have a greater impact on medium-sized companies, since they lack the financial resources of larger companies. Medium-sized company stocks are typically less liquid than large company stocks.
Small company risk. Small company stocks tend to be more volatile than medium-sized or large company stocks. Because stock analysts are less likely to follow small companies, less information about them is available to investors. Industry-wide reversals may have a greater impact on small companies, since they may lack the financial resources of larger companies. Small company stocks are typically less liquid than large company stocks.
Foreign investment risk. The fund faces the risks inherent in foreign investing. Adverse political, economic or social developments could undermine the value of the fund’s investments or prevent the fund from realizing the full value of its investments. In June 2016, citizens of the United Kingdom approved a referendum to leave the European Union (EU), creating economic and political uncertainty. Significant uncertainty exists regarding the timing of the United Kingdom’s anticipated withdrawal from the EU and the effects such withdrawal may have on the United Kingdom, other EU countries and the global economy.
Financial reporting standards for companies based in foreign markets differ from those in the US. Additionally, foreign securities markets generally are smaller and less liquid than US markets. To the extent that the fund invests in non-US dollar denominated foreign securities, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the US dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities.
Derivatives risk. Risks associated with derivatives may include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security, index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives may result in losses or missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation; and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund’s exposure to the market and magnify potential losses.
Securities lending risk. Any decline in the value of a portfolio security that occurs while the security is out on loan is borne by the fund and will adversely affect performance. Also, there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while holding the security.
Counterparty risk. A financial institution or other counterparty with whom the fund does business, or that underwrites, distributes or guarantees any investments or contracts that the fund owns or is otherwise exposed to, may decline in financial health and become unable to honor its commitments. This could cause losses for the fund or could delay the return or delivery of collateral or other assets to the fund.
Liquidity risk. In certain situations, it may be difficult or impossible to sell an investment and/or the fund may sell certain investments at a price or time that is not advantageous in order to meet redemption requests or other cash needs. Unusual market conditions, such as an unusually high volume of redemptions or other similar conditions could increase liquidity risk for the fund.
Pricing risk. If market conditions make it difficult to value some investments, the fund may value these investments using more subjective methods, such as fair value pricing. In such cases, the value determined for an investment could be different from the value realized upon such investment’s sale. As a result, you could pay more than the market value when buying fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling fund shares.
Operational and technology risk. Cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the fund’s service providers or counterparties, issuers of securities held by the fund, or other market participants may adversely affect the fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the fund or impairing fund operations.
