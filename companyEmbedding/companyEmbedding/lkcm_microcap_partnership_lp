LKCM Micro Cap Partnership, L.P. seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by drawing on the firm’s private equity expertise, long investing history, and extensive industry knowledge to opportunistically invest in traditionally more volatile, but potentially more rewarding, microcap public companies with market capitalizations below $600 million at the initial time of investment.
The development of investment opportunities for this partnership emanates from the fundamental research process led by our experienced internal research staff.   This team performs rigorous, primary research that seeks to identify small, mid and large capitalization companies that have a true competitive advantage in their industry.  This philosophy provides the basis for our investments in this partnership and is consistent with our firm-wide approach of seeking to build long-term value for our clients.
