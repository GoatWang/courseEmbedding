Pixelworks: A Buy Ahead Of Apple Product Announcements - Pixelworks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PXLW) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pixelworks: A Buy Ahead Of Apple Product AnnouncementsSep. 9.14 | About: Pixelworks, Inc. (PXLW) RightEdge Analytics Deep Value, special situations, momentum, research analystSummaryDue to its current Apple revenue stream, Pixelworks may be mentioned in Apple's upcoming product release as the producer of an integral component in one of its new devices.The Iris chip is a ground breaking component bringing high definition to mobile and is going into mass production.Pixelworks is undervalued relative to peers and should be trading at about $17 per share prior to the upcoming Apple announcement.A $50 million shelf registration has been filed and could be used for a huge product ramp up for a client like Apple.Background:
Pixelworks Inc. (NASDAQ:PXLW) designs and produces semiconductors for digital video display in mobile devices, televisions and projectors. Pixelworks' varying product lines show great diversity and promise for a small cap company. Their large contracts with industry leading clientele show that they are building exceptional demand in the marketplace.
Iris-Bringing HD to mobile devices:
Pixelworks has developed the first high definition video processor for mobile applications. This device can be implemented in devices such as smartphones, tablets, and ultrabooks. The Iris chip will deliver superior performance to all current offerings. The Iris chip is able to offload the CPU and GPU to free up system resources and conserve battery life. According to testing, the Pixelworks chip could save as much as 44% of power usage. Pixelworks has said that Iris has been sampled by customers since June and may already be in mass production.

The Apple Connection
News first came out on March 3, 2014 in the 10-K that over 10% of PXLW's revenues came from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). On August 8, 2014 in the company's most recent 10-Q, it was disclosed that Apple accounted for 14% of Pixelworks' revenues. There are many different applications that would be advantageous for both players. At the current time, it is unknown why Pixelworks is receiving this revenue from Apple.

New board member with deep connections to Apple
On April 4, 2014, Pixelworks brought David Tupman on to the board of directors. Tupman was a vice president in Apple's hardware engineering division prior to becoming the CEO at Details Lab Inc. Tupman led the hardware and technology teams for both the iPhone and the iPod until 2011. We believe that this connection will facilitate a long-term relationship between Apple and Pixelworks.
What will Pixelworks do for Apple?

Source: appleinsider.com
We see three different ways that Pixelworks could integrate with future Apple products. All three of these hypotheses will improve Apple's current line and provide immeasurable revenue growth for Pixelworks. While none of these conjectures have been announced, these are the three viable reasons for the revenue that Pixelworks is receiving from Apple:
Iris video processor in iPhone and/or iPad
Iris would integrate perfectly with Apple's soon to be announced iPhone 6 and iPad. It only stands to reason that being a market leader, Apple would be the first to offer high definition video viewing on their mobile devices. We also firmly believe that if the Iris chip goes into one of these devices, it will go in both. The development timeline of the Iris chip also seems to match up well with the release of these devices.
Pixelworks is building out the Apple TV
Since the rumors of Apple TV began to circulate Pixelworks has generated 14% of their revenue from Apple. This would explain the developmental stages of this new product using PXLW processors. In the conference call from the last earnings report on July 31, 2014, the CEO Bruce Walicek telegraphs that they have developed a mass production version of large screen for a partner (Apple):


"For projected and panel large screen display applications we continued to ship volume production of the PA168 during the quarter, which includes our patented halo free technology, and tackles the most demanding video quality problems in monitors and Ultra-HD TVs, and during the quarter we began shipping the mass production version of the advanced SOC for large screen applications we developed under our co-development partnership. This is a significant milestone on this project and we expect to ramp production in the second half of 2014 and beyond."

Pixelworks is building a projector for the iPhone 6
It has been rumored that the iPhone 6 will have a projection device feature. With Pixelworks' expertise in both mobile processors and projection displays, they are a logical producer of this device. This device could be an option or an additional feature to the iPhone so its impact will not be known until it is released.

$50 Million shelf registration
On August 29, 2014, PXLW filed a Form S-3 for a $50 million shelf registration. We see this as both a risk and an opportunity. The primary risk involved with this registration is that it gives PXLW the ability to dilute the shares if they chose to. However, based on a current financial analysis of PXLW, we do not see the need for them to dilute unless there is an extremely large order in the pipeline. The dilution may lead to a decline in share price. On the contrary, we feel that the dilution will not come without some large announcement that would greatly counteract this dilution to the upside. We believe that this shelf registration is pointing to a direct ramp up of a large order from Apple.

Peer Analysis
We feel that PXLW is currently undervalued against it peers. Even without a large event from Apple on Tuesday PXLW is trading at a discount. QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ:QUIK) is the most comparable company in the industry to PXLW. QUIK is of similar market cap as PXLW and designs and builds semiconductors for tablets and smartphones. Based on multiple metrics, QUIK is trading at an unjustified premium to PXLW.

Source: RightEdge Analytics
Based on our valuation and growth measures, we believe that PXLW is worth about $17 per share as it stands. These estimates are based on Pixelworks' current business without factoring in the large Apple event we expect to take place in the coming days.

Source: RightEdge Analytics
Conclusion
At its current share price, Pixelworks is trading at a great discount. Before factoring in any potential Apple relationships, PXLW has a price target of $17 per share. Because we feel that the Apple-Pixelworks relationship is in the early stages, Pixelworks has an unlimited upside. Pixelworks is a stock to buy ahead of Apple's product release on September 9th.
