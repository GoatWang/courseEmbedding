To the best knowledge of the Reporting Person, during the last five years, the Reporting Person has not been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws; and

The Reporting Person is a citizen of the United States of America.


Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

Subsequent to approval by the Issuer's shareholders on February 10, 2005, the Reporting Person acquired 200,000 shares of the Issuer's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series B Stock") in a private placement transaction for a purchase price of $2.50 per share.  The Reporting Person also acquired 60,000 shares of the Series B Stock in consideration for advice and assistance services by the Reporting Person with respect to the sale of 1,000,000 shares of Series B Stock at $2.50 per share in the Issuer's private placement, which services were assessed at a fair market value of $150,000.  The Series B Stock is convertible into Common Stock as set forth in Item 4.  The Reporting Person used existing personal funds to acquire the 200,000 shares of Series B Stock.
Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.

The Issuer, Pascere Investments, LLC, and individual investors, which includes the Reporting Person, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 30, 2004, as amended (the "Pascere Purchase Agreement"), whereby the Reporting Person agreed to purchase 200,000 shares of Series B Stock from the Issuer.  Pascere Investments, LLC ("Pascere") is a Colorado limited liability company of which the Reporting Person is the managing member. It was originally contemplated that the purchase of the Series B Stock would have been effected through Pascere, the sole asset of which would have been the Series B Stock, and the sole owners of which would have been the Reporting Person and other individual investors.  Prior to completing the private placement, the transaction was restructured to provide for direct holding by the investors of the Series B Stock.

The Issuer and the Reporting Person entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of December 30, 2004 (the "Reinhard Purchase Agreement"), whereby the Reporting Person agreed to purchase 60,000 shares of Series B Stock from the Issuer.  As described in Item 3 above, the 60,000 shares of Series B Stock represent consideration for advice and assistance services by the Reporting Person with respect to the sale of 1,000,000 shares of Series B stock at $2.50 per share in the Issuer's private placement, which services were valued at $150,000.

Certain provisions of the Pascere and Reinhard Purchase Agreements will be discussed below; however, such discussion is qualified in its entirety by the Pascere and Reinhard Purchase Agreements attached hereto as Exhibits B and C, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  From and after February 10, 2006, the holders of the Series B Stock, including the Reporting Person if still a holder, will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends of $0.15 per share per annum. Upon liquidation, the holders of the Series B Stock, including the Reporting Person if still a holder, will be entitled to an amount equal to $2.50 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends prior to any distributions being made to the holders of Common Stock.

The Pascere and Reinhard Purchase Agreements each provide certain participation rights to the purchasers of Series B Stock. Therefore, before the Issuer may issue any new securities, the Issuer must offer to the Reporting Person, along with the other purchasers of Series B Stock, the right, for a period of 15 days, to purchase for cash at the price for which such securities are being issued, a number of shares of such securities so that the Reporting Person will continue to hold the same proportional equity interest in the Issuer. These participation rights apply to the Reporting Person only as long as two-thirds of the Series B Stock, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Stock, and the Common Stock held by the Reporting Person on the date of the purchase agreement remain held by the Reporting Person.  These participation rights do not apply to certain issuances of securities, including securities issued pursuant to an acquisition
or a public offering of securities.

The Issuer, Pascere, and the individual investors which includes the Reporting Person, each entered into Stock Restriction and Registration Rights Agreements. The Issuer agreed to file, at its expense, a registration statement covering resales of the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Stock.  Both Stock Restriction and Registration Rights Agreements and a Supplemental Agreement are attached as Exhibits D, E, and F, respectively.

The Pascere and Reinhard Purchase Agreements each provide that the Reporting Person may only transfer all or any portion of or interest in his Series B Stock for value pursuant to a bona fide offer to purchase.  If the Reporting Person desires to sell his Series B Stock pursuant to such an offer, he must give the Issuer notice which must contain a description of all of the material terms and conditions of the offer and a copy of it, if any.  The Issuer will then have a period of 15 days to determine whether to purchase all of the Reporting Person's Series B Stock upon the terms and conditions contained in the offer to purchase.

Except as described in this Item 4, the Reporting Person does not have any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any transaction, change or event specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, though as a director and significant stockholder of the Issuer, the Reporting Person may, from time to time, consider one or more of such actions.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

(a)  The Reporting Person is the direct beneficial owner of an aggregate total of 260,000 shares of the Series B Stock which are convertible into an equal number of shares of Common Stock, representing an approximate 7.2% of the voting power of the outstanding Common Stock based upon 2,354,710 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of January 31, 2005, plus the 1,240,000 shares of Common Stock into which all outstanding shares of Series B Stock are currently convertible as set forth in the Issuer's Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on February 18, 2005.

(b)  The Reporting Person has sole voting and dispositive power over 260,000 shares of Series�B Stock which are convertible into an equal number of shares of Common Stock held directly by the Reporting Person.

(c) As described in this statement on Schedule 13D, the following transactions in the Issuer's securities have occurred within the last sixty days by the Reporting Person, which purchases were privately-negotiated transactions.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.

The descriptions of the Pascere and Reinhard Purchase Agreements, the Series B Stock, the Stock Restriction and Registration Rights Agreements in Item 4 above are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The Reporting Person expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of any securities of the Issuer other than those he holds directly.  Except as set forth herein, the Reporting Person is unaware of any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to the Issuer's securities.
