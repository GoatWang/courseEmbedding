What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

Layer opened.Read the transcript







Liz Tammaro: So we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast. We're going to get started with our first question and, Jim, I'm going to give this one to you. So it makes a lot of sense before we get started, let's define what is an ETF. Jim Rowley: Simply put, an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, right− It's a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities. Investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund. The fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand. Furthermore, and I should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors, whether it's an index in particular or a market strategy. And when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of ETFs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. And that's the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate. So for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and ETFs, they're overwhelmingly similar actually. Liz Tammaro: And even thinking about that, we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an ETF or, sorry, even vice versa, ETF versus mutual fund. And even maybe what are some of the disadvantages. Jim Rowley: I'll take that because I think I don't necessarily like the word disadvantage. I think differences is maybe the more appropriate term. And we just addressed some of the similarities between ETFs and mutual funds, so it's maybe more important to know what are the actual differences. And really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds, right− We're talking about exchange-traded funds. ETF investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities, and the price that they get is a tradeable market price. Mutual fund investors, on the other hand, they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but it's back and forth with the fund itself and they get an end-of-day NAV. So we think about all the similarities and, again, sometimes there's a discussion about how different they are; but, really, the differences come down to those two items. It's trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and it's trading at a market price rather than getting the end-of-day NAV. Jim Rowley: I think we actually have a great way to illustrate that. I think we have a chart that addresses that point that Doug was talking about that ETFs are overwhelming. They just happen to be index funds. And when the chart comes up, a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios. But instead of breaking them down by ETF versus mutual fund, we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into ETF and mutual fund. And when you see the expense ratios, you see that given an indexing strategy, whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies, whether it's an ETF or a mutual fund. So it has a lot more to do with whether or not it's an indexing strategy than whether or not it's an ETF or a mutual fund. Liz Tammaro: And similar to that question, we have another one that's come in from Bruce asking about how easy is it to buy and/or sell an ETF versus a mutual fund− Jim Rowley: A lot of moving parts in that question because I think the default has always been mutual funds because they've been around longer. So it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars. You put your orders in in dollar terms. You're happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a 4 PM NAV. You might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you. With an ETF, investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account. And now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares, mutually speaking. There's no fractionals there. When you put your order in shares, you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount. So, you know, the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing. Important information All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, or other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.

LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

PRICE AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Price and distributions
as of 07/28/2017






NAVFor funds with a fluctuating price per share, the net asset value (NAV) is the market value of a mutual fund's total assets, minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.


2.06%
B
BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH






Dividend yieldThe annual rate of return on a share of stock, determined by dividing the annual dividend by its current share price. In a stock mutual fund, this figure represents the average dividend yield of the stocks held by the fund.

Fees and minimums
Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Mid-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility than large-cap stocks because, among other things, medium-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Vanguard targeting overseas market with active funds
The firm is pushing into Europe and Asia-Pacific by de-emphasizing index-tracking products in favor of an armada of actively managed funds





Jul 28, 2017 @ 12:04 pm
By 
	Bloomberg News


















+ Zoom




      Walking through Vanguard Group's headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania is a lesson in naval history.Paintings of the 18th-century ship that inspired the company's name jostle with seascapes and a framed letter from legendary British Admiral Horatio Nelson. Even the campus itself conjures tales of derring-do, with buildings swooping along a shallow curve, as if tracing a galleon from stern to bow.This maritime heritage is taking on new significance as the $4.4 trillion U.S.-based firm looks overseas for growth amid the biggest leadership shakeup in almost a decade. Vanguard is pushing into Europe and Asia-Pacific, but it's de-emphasizing the index-tracking products that brought in about 75 percent of its assets in favor of an armada of actively managed funds, which Europeans tend to prefer. The offerings will still have Vanguard's signature emphasis on low fees, with some undercutting European rivals by more than half.
				



"We're trying to catch up with what we've already done on the indexing side, to be able to offer low-cost, high-quality, active products to investors on a more global basis," said Greg Davis, the 46-year-old incoming chief investment officer, during an interview at the company's offices.(More: Vanguard's new CIO Greg Davis talks bonds, stocks and costs)About $275 billion of the company's assets lie overseas, yet this equates to less than 10 percent of Vanguard's overall bulk. And while Vanguard is a household name in the U.S., it's a relative newbie compared with Europe's asset-management brands.GLOBAL GROWTHVanguard plans to change all that. The company began offering new mutual funds in Europe for the first time in nine years last May and listed four active exchange-traded funds a few months prior. It has started similar ETFs in Canada, and plans to set up its first active fixed-income fund in Europe within six months, according to Davis.Active funds are "pretty ubiquitous" in Europe, where that style of management resonates, according to Rich Powers, head of ETF product management. These types of funds house about 86 percent of assets in the region versus about 65 percent in the U.S., where index-tracking ETFs are more established. The active funds typically cost more, according to data from Morningstar, but that hasn't yet been a deal-breaker for investors on the continent."In the last five years, all the headlines are about the onslaught of passive, but we have more or less doubled our assets under management in that time," said Maarten Slendebroek, chief executive officer at U.K.-based Jupiter Fund Management Plc, which manages about $61 billion. "If you have really strong performance and you outperform, then customers will be happy to pay."(More: Vanguard winning at bond inflows, too)Vanguard plans to test that thesis. Investors pay an average of 1.02 percent in fees for star managers on euro-based funds, Morningstar's data show. Vanguard is charging 0.22 percent for its active ETFs, and 0.6 percent for three of its new mutual funds. The company has previously said high costs was one of the main reasons why most actively managed funds underperformed their chosen benchmarks in the past 15 years."Because our size, our scale and our ownership structure is so unique, we have this natural ability to continue to lower cost," Davis said.CONSUMER PLATFORMDavis is taking over as CIO after Vanguard announced this month that the current investment chief, Tim Buckley, 48, will become chief executive. Bill McNabb, 60, is stepping down at the end of the year after holding the top job since 2008.An "inexorable tide" toward fee-based advising has acted as a tailwind in the U.S. and overseas, according to McNabb. A new European regulation known as MiFID II that takes effect next year will shine a light on inducements paid to distributors for selling funds, highlighting the more relationship-based approach to advice promoted by the likes of Vanguard. The rule also requires reporting ETF trades — they're now mostly off-exchange — potentially boosting liquidity in that market.The company's advisory outfit will support its global aspirations, Davis said. The firm's Personal Advisor Services platform garnered $83 billion since it began in 2015 for U.S. investors, and help with money-management is something needed by investors around the world, he said. The company started a direct-to-consumer platform in the U.K. in May."The regulatory landscape has shifted in a lot of markets and there's the big global trends toward transparency around fees, better regulation, clearer understanding of the value chain and a recognition that cost actually matters," McNabb said.'CULTURE CARRIERS'The company plans to open an office in Germany, where it might list some of its ETFs. It has also opened a sales and marketing office in Shanghai and added economic and strategic resources to an outpost in Hong Kong. Most recently Vanguard hired a new head of its Mexican business to help the firm expand.High achievers rotate around these bases, with Davis spending time in Australia before his most recent role. These executives act as "culture carriers" for Vanguard's brand of asset management, with employees encouraged to think of one another as "crew members" who lunch in a canteen called The Galley and exercise at the Shipshape gym.(More: Dan Wiener, Vanguard's gadfly, has keen eye on investing)As McNabb says, "when you walk into these offices, wherever they are, you'd think you were here — except for the accents."The outgoing CEO has few regrets as he hands over command to Buckley, but says the company "could have been faster" in establishing itself as a global firm.McNabb will leave day-to-day leadership to Buckley starting in January and focus on corporate governance as Vanguard's chairman. His navigation skills won't go to seed, however — when he's not in the office, he'll be indulging his love for rowing on the Schuylkill River.

      Walking through Vanguard Group's headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania is a lesson in naval history.Paintings of the 18th-century ship that inspired the company's name jostle with seascapes and a framed letter from legendary British Admiral Horatio Nelson. Even the campus itself conjures tales of derring-do, with buildings swooping along a shallow curve, as if tracing a galleon from stern to bow.This maritime heritage is taking on new significance as the $4.4 trillion U.S.-based firm looks overseas for growth amid the biggest leadership shakeup in almost a decade. Vanguard is pushing into Europe and Asia-Pacific, but it's de-emphasizing the index-tracking products that brought in about 75 percent of its assets in favor of an armada of actively managed funds, which Europeans tend to prefer. The offerings will still have Vanguard's signature emphasis on low fees, with some undercutting European rivals by more than half.
				



"We're trying to catch up with what we've already done on the indexing side, to be able to offer low-cost, high-quality, active products to investors on a more global basis," said Greg Davis, the 46-year-old incoming chief investment officer, during an interview at the company's offices.(More: Vanguard's new CIO Greg Davis talks bonds, stocks and costs)About $275 billion of the company's assets lie overseas, yet this equates to less than 10 percent of Vanguard's overall bulk. And while Vanguard is a household name in the U.S., it's a relative newbie compared with Europe's asset-management brands.GLOBAL GROWTHVanguard plans to change all that. The company began offering new mutual funds in Europe for the first time in nine years last May and listed four active exchange-traded funds a few months prior. It has started similar ETFs in Canada, and plans to set up its first active fixed-income fund in Europe within six months, according to Davis.Active funds are "pretty ubiquitous" in Europe, where that style of management resonates, according to Rich Powers, head of ETF product management. These types of funds house about 86 percent of assets in the region versus about 65 percent in the U.S., where index-tracking ETFs are more established. The active funds typically cost more, according to data from Morningstar, but that hasn't yet been a deal-breaker for investors on the continent."In the last five years, all the headlines are about the onslaught of passive, but we have more or less doubled our assets under management in that time," said Maarten Slendebroek, chief executive officer at U.K.-based Jupiter Fund Management Plc, which manages about $61 billion. "If you have really strong performance and you outperform, then customers will be happy to pay."(More: Vanguard winning at bond inflows, too)Vanguard plans to test that thesis. Investors pay an average of 1.02 percent in fees for star managers on euro-based funds, Morningstar's data show. Vanguard is charging 0.22 percent for its active ETFs, and 0.6 percent for three of its new mutual funds. The company has previously said high costs was one of the main reasons why most actively managed funds underperformed their chosen benchmarks in the past 15 years."Because our size, our scale and our ownership structure is so unique, we have this natural ability to continue to lower cost," Davis said.CONSUMER PLATFORMDavis is taking over as CIO after Vanguard announced this month that the current investment chief, Tim Buckley, 48, will become chief executive. Bill McNabb, 60, is stepping down at the end of the year after holding the top job since 2008.An "inexorable tide" toward fee-based advising has acted as a tailwind in the U.S. and overseas, according to McNabb. A new European regulation known as MiFID II that takes effect next year will shine a light on inducements paid to distributors for selling funds, highlighting the more relationship-based approach to advice promoted by the likes of Vanguard. The rule also requires reporting ETF trades — they're now mostly off-exchange — potentially boosting liquidity in that market.The company's advisory outfit will support its global aspirations, Davis said. The firm's Personal Advisor Services platform garnered $83 billion since it began in 2015 for U.S. investors, and help with money-management is something needed by investors around the world, he said. The company started a direct-to-consumer platform in the U.K. in May."The regulatory landscape has shifted in a lot of markets and there's the big global trends toward transparency around fees, better regulation, clearer understanding of the value chain and a recognition that cost actually matters," McNabb said.'CULTURE CARRIERS'The company plans to open an office in Germany, where it might list some of its ETFs. It has also opened a sales and marketing office in Shanghai and added economic and strategic resources to an outpost in Hong Kong. Most recently Vanguard hired a new head of its Mexican business to help the firm expand.High achievers rotate around these bases, with Davis spending time in Australia before his most recent role. These executives act as "culture carriers" for Vanguard's brand of asset management, with employees encouraged to think of one another as "crew members" who lunch in a canteen called The Galley and exercise at the Shipshape gym.(More: Dan Wiener, Vanguard's gadfly, has keen eye on investing)As McNabb says, "when you walk into these offices, wherever they are, you'd think you were here — except for the accents."The outgoing CEO has few regrets as he hands over command to Buckley, but says the company "could have been faster" in establishing itself as a global firm.McNabb will leave day-to-day leadership to Buckley starting in January and focus on corporate governance as Vanguard's chairman. His navigation skills won't go to seed, however — when he's not in the office, he'll be indulging his love for rowing on the Schuylkill River.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
