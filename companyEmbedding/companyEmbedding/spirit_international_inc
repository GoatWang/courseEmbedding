 Our Story


Spirit International began in 1995 with its primary focus on displays and packaging for the jewelry industry. Based on the company's ability to create custom designs, manufacture high quality product at a reasonable price with on time delivery, while supporting each step with the highest levels of customer service, the company soon gained major customers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kmart, Sears, Kohl's and many others ... 

Based initially on requests from our customers, Spirit International began to expand into providing store fixtures and displays for other areas of the retail environments such as apparel, produce, bakery, vision, gifts, cosmetics, hardware, and more. 

Today Spirit International has become one of the leading creative forces and top manufacturers in the industry focused on store design, store fixtures, LED lighting, millwork and installation, all incorporating the entire retail environment while still being a dominant presence for jewelry in-case and counter top displays and overall packaging.

The following Use of Proceeds is based on estimates made by management. The
Company planned the Use of Proceeds after deducting estimated offering expenses
estimated to be $9,300. Management prepared the milestones based on three levels
of offering raise success: Minimum Offering proceeds raised of $20,000, 50% of
the Maximum Offering proceeds raised ($200,000), and the Maximum Offering
proceeds raised of $400,000 through the offering. The costs associated with
operating as a public company are included in all our budgeted scenarios and
management is responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep
the costs to a minimum.

Minimum Offering proceeds raised of $20,000 is budgeted to sustain operations
for a twelve-month period. The minimum amount is sufficient to keep the Company
current with its public listing status costs with prudently budgeted funds
remaining which will be sufficient to complete the development of our marketing
package. If the Company were to raise 50% of the Maximum Offering which is
$200,000 then we would be able to expand our marketing and sales package.
Raising the Maximum Offering of $400,000 will enable the Company to implement
our full business. If we begin to generate profits, we plan to increase our
marketing and sales activity accordingly.

Spirit intends to use the proceeds from this offering as follows:

                                                                    25% of                                                        75% of

Notes:

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the proceeds of
this offering based on planned use of funds for the our operations and current
objectives.

Under Net Proceeds, Legal and accounting are Legal and auditor/accounting fees
not related to this offering.

Under Net Proceeds, Marketing and Sales will largely be related to the hiring
and payment of a human sales force.

Under Repayment of New World Debt, this is the amount to be paid on July 1, 2015
in the event that we generate no revenues and are unable to make the payments as
required under our agreement with New World Distillery.  The Company may change
how it allocates its proceeds in order to repay this debt in the case that the
full amount of the offering is not raised.

The offering proceeds will not be utilized to repay any existing indebtedness
including that owed to Mr. Dadon.

We currently consider the foregoing project our priority and intend to use the
proceeds from this offering for such projects.

Clarified as to term use and disclosure added that fees increase with the
offering size as it is anticipated that a greater size of raise will increase
the corporations activities which will result in a greater number of
transactions thus resulting in the need for additional disclosure and
accounting.


The whisky industry has been merging and acquiring distillery assets and
trademarked brand names since the beginning of the 20th century, now only a
handful of companies dominate whisky production and marketing.

We have many competitors, some of which already are well known household brands
such as Jack Daniels, Johnny Walker, Glenfiddich, Macallan and many others. The
particular brand of Malt Whiskey that we are selling differs from our
competitors because when making this whiskey, it utilizes ex-sherry small
barrels for the purpose of aging this whiskey with a unique flavor. The
distillery uses Australian malt barley and premium quality production
techniques. They use a smaller boutique distillery that has its own unique
special recipe, which offers a quality premium taste. Their products world-class
malt rich whisky’s is offered in different size bottles that will be appealing
to the premium whisky drinker.


Company Description
Spirit International, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 10,
2014 under the same name. Since inception, Spirit has generated only $3,000 in
revenues, and has accumulated losses in the amount of $82,410 as of audit date
December 31, 2014. Spirit has never been party to any


 bankruptcy, receivership
or similar proceeding, nor has it undergone any material reclassification,
merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in
the ordinary course of business. Spirit has signed a License and Distribution
Agreement with New World Whisky Distilleries Pty. Ltd. under which Spirit has
received the exclusive right for distribution in Europe and the Middle East as
more fully described herein.

The terms of our agreement are that we have to pay $75,000 by or on July 1st,
2015. Royalties are calculated at 2% of gross profits earned from all sales
under this agreement. Royalties will be paid to New World and then deducted from
the $75,000 owed to the licensor. On July 1st, 2015, any balance still open will
be paid in full at that time.

The term of this agreement will be perpetuity from the effective date, unless
terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement for cause of early
termination as stated in #8 of the agreement.

Mr. Dadon heard about the product from a friend that lives in Australia, the
product is being sold in Australia. Mr Dadon has started working already
compiling list of wholesalers and Distributors that he is cold calling to
introduce the product to. The plan at this time is that he is also interviewing
sales people that he can hire on a commission bases so that he does not need to
spend any additional funds at this time.

Our agreement with New World is that they are going to be drop shipping to our
clients. They would be responsible to deal with all government and industry
regulations as well as any import licenses and dealing with government tariffs
laws and taxes, duties to be paid.

Spirit has yet to commence full scale planned operations. As of the date of this
Registration Statement, Spirit has commenced only minimal operations and has
generated only minimal revenues. The Company will not be profitable until it
derives sufficient revenues and cash flows from services. Spirit believes that,
if it obtains the proceeds from this offering, it will be able to implement the
full business plan and conduct business pursuant to the business plan for the
next twelve months.

Spirit has signed a License and Distribution Agreement with New World Whisky
Distilleries Pty. Ltd. under which Spirit has received the exclusive right for
distribution in Europe and the Middle East.

New World Whisky Distilleries Pty. Ltd. has an ambition to be the leading
Australian premium whisky company, building a consumer brand amongst spirit
drinkers.

The global financial crisis has shifted wealth: both with regards to who has it,
and how it is being spent. However, premium brands have continued to show strong
growth. With 10% growth rate anticipated for this year for a total of $340.6
billion, that increase would mark the third straight year that luxury-goods
sales have seen a growth rate of at in excess of 10 % (Bain & Co. annual study
October 2012). The study also finds a generational shift under way as new and
young consumers seek significantly different experiences from luxury
consumption.

Driving this growth is the developing middle/upper class in emerging markets
like Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and India. And whisky, especially for
premium branded whisky, is capitalizing on this shift and the generational
opportunity developing markets afford. In the traditional western markets where
whisky has been established longer, the aging population and increasing
discernment across all whisky segments is creating strong demand for premium
whiskies. Even in the traditional wine cultures of southern Europe, younger
consumers are being increasingly attracted to whisky as part of their modern
whisky repertoire.

The new whisky drinker is proving more experimental and there is also a movement
away from lighter blended whiskies, evidenced by the recent growth of single
malts, premium bourbons and specialists offerings from the new micro whisky
distilleries. The growing opportunity in Australia and worldwide for an
outstanding malt whisky, at an attractive price, is a fundamental reason why
this company was established.

Australian wines are known and loved around the world for their taste, quality,
and craftsmanship, and we aim to leverage this reputation in our efforts to
build this premium brand.

New World Whisky Distilleries Pty. Ltd.’s whisky is produced in Melbourne, which
offers the perfect climate to produce the whisky; the maturation period is
shorter than traditional scotch whiskies – reducing inventory holding costs
while maintaining its premium quality. This is a significant strategic advantage
of our business that we aim to leverage to maximum effect.

The Distillery uses Australian malted barley that is malted to specific
requirements, Victorian water, a bespoken hybrid yeast strain and copper pot
stills manufactured in Australia. The spirit is matured in re-coopered
Australian ex-sherry barrels. The barrels are re-coopered in Australia into
small casks (50/100L) to accelerate maturation under highly variable climatic
conditions, allowing Victoria Valley Distribution (VVD) to produce a premium
whisky within three years (legal requirements 2 years in wood); avoiding slower
maturation in larger wooden vessels (e.g. 300-700L) - + 12 years in Scotland.
