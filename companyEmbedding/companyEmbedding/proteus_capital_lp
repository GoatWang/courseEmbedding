Armed with more than 300 issued patents and led by some of the brightest minds in technology, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, we’ve invented Digital Medicine, a new category that measures medication treatment effectiveness, helps physicians improve clinical outcomes and patients reach health goals. Together, with leading health systems and pharmaceutical companies, we’re bringing this new digital solution to healthcare providers, thereby increasing access to better insight, optimized therapies and lower costs.

Upcoming Events





Embrace Digital Disruption to Reinvent Healthcare
Time: Monday, March 13, 9:00a.m. – 10:00a.m.
Location: Austin Convention Center, Room 8ABC
Speaker: Molly O’Neill, Chief Commercial Officer, one of three panelists
While healthcare has lagged behind other industries in adopting new, disruptive technologies, consumer expectations have continued to shift. We live in a world where convenience trumps all, and most services are available at the push of a button. Why can’t healthcare be the same? This panel will discuss how patients will access healthcare in the future as the traditional care delivery system is augmented by digital innovations and how Baylor Scott & White Health has embraced these innovations by collaborating with entrepreneurs and startups to redesign traditional care models and simplify complex problems.



Euthanizing Our Global System of Sick Care
Time: March 14, 12:30p.m. – 1:30p.m.
Location: Austin Convention Center, Room 8ABC
Speakers: Andy Thompson, CEO with Dr. Leslie Saxon, USC Center for Body Computing

In an era of exploding population growth, chronic illness and new pandemics, our healthcare systems cannot scale, and demands outstrip global resources. But, are we facing a global healthcare crisis or is this an age of unprecedented health-care opportunity? Find out why our current systems of ‘sick care’ fail us and how digital can help scale healthcare for the future. Discover how a human-centered redesign to our healthcare systems can drive new, proactive models of care that mesh better with people’s lives, support physicians and caregivers, reward positive behavior, improve health outcomes and protect human dignity, privacy and security. Part of the IEEE Tech for Humanity Series.

Proteus has had a strategic partnership with Otsuka since 2012. Otsuka and Proteus are partnering to combine Otsuka’s ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) with the FDA-cleared Proteus® ingestible sensor embedded in a single tablet at point of manufacture. This is the first time the FDA cleared Proteus® ingestible sensor will be integrated with an approved medication as a combination product to measure medication-taking patterns and physiologic response. FDA-approved medication (Abilify) has been combined with a sensor within the medication tablet (the Proteus ingestible sensor) to measure actual medication-taking patterns and physiological response.
