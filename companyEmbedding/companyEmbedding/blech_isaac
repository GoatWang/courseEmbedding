“We are honored to welcome Mr. Blech to our Board of Directors and are extremely pleased that Dr. Barer has agreed to take on additional responsibilities,” said Brian Leuthner, co-founder and CEO of Edge Therapeutics. “We are confident that with their guidance Edge can build a commercial biopharmaceutical company well-positioned to develop valuable and potentially life-saving therapies that address complications after ruptured brain aneurysms, subdural hematomas, and other types of brain hemorrhage.”
“Edge is seeking to build novel products using a site specific, sustained release microparticle technology platform,” said Isaac Blech. “I am delighted to help Edge Therapeutics build the capabilities and organizational structure needed to carry its products through clinical trials, regulatory approval and ultimately to the patients who can benefit from these therapies.”
About Edge Therapeutics
Edge Therapeutics is a clinical-stage, hospital-focused biopharmaceutical company that uses its novel site-specific and sustained-release microparticle technology platform to deliver drugs to the brain to prevent complications occurring after subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma and intracerebral hemorrhage, all of which currently have minimally effective or no effective therapies. Edge works with some of the world’s foremost scientists and critical care physicians from leading academic research centers to develop proprietary formulations of known active drugs for direct therapeutic delivery to the site of injury in the brain.
The Company’s patent-pending bio-absorbable microparticle formulations release drugs locally and consistently at therapeutic concentrations in the brain, with the objective of maximizing therapeutic activity and avoiding treatment-limiting systemic side effects seen with current treatments. Currently, oral- or i.v.-administered therapies are employed but in suboptimal concentrations due to the generation of systemic side effects. Edge’s lead products, EG-1962 (nimodipine microparticles) and EG-1964 are being developed to prevent various delayed complications after brain hemorrhage. EG-1962 is a proprietary microparticle formulation of the generic calcium channel blocker nimodipine, while EG-1964 delivers a hemostatic agent.

“There’s no question that if I had been in a coma for the last 20 years, I would wake up a billionaire today.” DAVID BLECH

He was once hailed as the king of biotechnology. In the industry’s frontier days, David Blech was the top gunslinger, quick to draw his checkbook to start new companies or prop up faltering ones.Mr. Blech was the initial financial force behind the industry giant Celgene, the rare disease specialist Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and the cancer drug developer Ariad Pharmaceuticals, not to mention Icos, which developed the impotence pill Cialis.In the early 1990s, Mr. Blech was worth about $300 million and made the Forbes list of 400 wealthiest Americans.Now, however, he is about to begin a four-year prison term, about $11 million in debt and mainly an afterthought to the industry he helped foster.

He squandered his fortune with reckless borrowing and stock trading in a quest for even greater riches. His Wall Street firm, D. Blech & Company, collapsed — dragging biotech share prices down with it — in 1994, on a day some called “Blech Thursday.” Comeback attempts have only gotten him deeper into trouble.

“There’s no question that if I had been in a coma for the last 20 years, I would wake up a billionaire today,” Mr. Blech, 57, said.Besides what his downfall means for his personal life, it reflects the maturation of the biotechnology industry from its get-rich-quick days, when someone like Mr. Blech, a music major with no scientific training, could make a difference with a few million dollars. Now billions are invested by funds managed by teams of doctors and scientists with Ph.D.’s.Mr. Blech (pronounced bleck) is to report on Sept. 18 to federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J., having pleaded guilty to manipulating the stock of two biotech companies as part of his latest comeback attempt. He also pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 1998, but avoided prison.In an interview at his Manhattan apartment, Mr. Blech said he hoped to be remembered for helping to create an industry that has saved lives.He said his reckless behavior stemmed in part from bipolar disorder, which left him at times feeling invincible and unable to restrain himself.“I didn’t know how to say no to a deal,” he said.Critics over the years have said Mr. Blech was merely an aggressive stock promoter who got lucky. They note that Celgene and Alexion did not become successful until long after Mr. Blech was associated with them.

But Mr. Blech still has supporters. Nick Arvanitidis recalled that in 1990, his company, Liposome Technology, was desperate for cash. Other investors spurned him, he said. But “David just wrote me a check for $3 million the same day I went to see him.” That allowed Liposome to survive and develop Doxil, an important cancer drug.

Jeffrey J. Collinson, a venture capitalist, said Mr. Blech saved several companies. “It’s painful to hear what happened and how he got into this position,” Mr. Collinson said. “It’s a sad story.”It is also an unlikely story. In 1980, Mr. Blech was working as a stockbroker while trying to become a songwriter. That fall, biotechnology pioneer Genentech went public and its share price doubled the first day.“I can do that,” Mr. Blech, then only 24, told his father, a rabbi who was also a stockbroker. Mr. Blech then called his brother, Isaac, who was working in advertising, and said, “Quit your job, we’re starting a genetics company.”Sitting around the kitchen table, the three came up with a name — Genetic Systems. Then they had to figure out what the company would actually do.An article in a science magazine led them to Robert Nowinski at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who was doing research on a new technology involving something called monoclonal antibodies.The Blechs promised Dr. Nowinski $200,000 and then raised $1 million from others. Half a year later, Genetic Systems went public and the Blechs’ stake was worth $10 million. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Genetic Systems for nearly $300 million, and the Blechs were richer still.David and Isaac Blech went on to form several other companies, some of which ultimately failed. They attracted top scientists, directors and advisers by offering them stock and a chance to get rich. The companies were often taken public quickly, so the Blechs and other early shareholders could realize a return.

Things began going wrong around 1990, when Mr. Blech wanted to expand while his more cautious brother wanted to take a hiatus. The brothers had a rancorous split and have essentially not talked since.Mr. Blech started D. Blech & Company, which underwrote stock offerings. When biotechnology stocks he was involved with weakened, he tried to prop them up by buying more shares, using $65 million in borrowed money. When creditors started calling in the loans, a desperate Mr. Blech started engaging in sham trades to make it look as if he was getting his house in order.

D. Blech & Company collapsed on Sept. 22, 1994. Emotionally broken, Mr. Blech checked himself into a hospital psychiatric ward for a brief stay. His wife filed for divorce. His remaining holdings — including a stake in Alexion that would be worth more than $1 billion today — were sold off for about $40 million to pay creditors.But instead of going to prison, Mr. Blech was sentenced to five years’ probation because of his bipolar disorder and his cooperation with the government.

“God forbid you should ever come back to this courtroom,” Judge Kevin T. Duffy said at the sentencing in 1999. Mr. Blech “solemnly pledged” that he would not.By the time his probation ended, his old formula would not work. The $15 million or so he had sheltered in trusts for his children no longer went so far. Start-ups could no longer go public just because they had “genetic” in their names. And companies did not want financing from a felon.So Mr. Blech turned to hard-pressed penny stock companies. Government investigators said he reverted to past behavior, trading through more than 50 nominee accounts in the name of his new wife, other relatives, even a yeshiva run by a cousin.In court proceedings and documents, Mr. Blech said he was so convinced that Pluristem Therapeutics, an Israeli stem cell company, would be successful that he spent $6 million, some of it borrowed, on its shares. In 2007, he said, he had to sell the shares to repay the loan, but feared that such a huge sale of a thinly traded stock would cause the price to collapse.So, according to prosecutors, Mr. Blech sold shares through some nominee accounts and bought shares through others, gradually reducing his holdings while making it appear there was an active market for the stock.Prosecutors said the scheme allowed him to sell the shares for $1.2 million when he might otherwise have gotten nothing. It accused Mr. Blech of a similar plot involving Intellect Neurosciences.

In 2012, Mr. Blech pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud. Once again he asked for mercy, citing his bipolar disease, his contributions to medicine and the hardship a prison sentence would impose on his family, including an autistic son.But the judge, Colleen McMahon, said the time for leniency had passed.“I bleed for your family, your wife, your kids,” she told him at the sentencing hearing in May. “It’s a terrible thing you have done to them, not me. I am not doing it to them. You did it to them. They will have to survive.”In addition to the four-year sentence, she ordered him to forfeit $1.34 million. Last month, Mr. Blech agreed to pay an additional $1.03 million to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr. Blech is appealing his sentence, saying it is excessive since he actually lost $5 million on his investment in Pluristem. But the appeal is not likely to be heard until he is already in prison.“I made my money legitimately, and I lost it illegitimately,” Mr. Blech said.He says that he wants to turn over a new leaf and that with the help of Gamblers Anonymous he has not traded a stock in two years.But he is still hoping for one more successful investment — from a remaining, sizable stake in Intellect Neurosciences. The company has a market valuation of only $1.5 million. But Mr. Blech said that if a drug for Alzheimer’s disease showed some promise in animal testing, Intellect could be acquired for a much larger sum.“If it works out, we’re out of trouble and I can pay my fines,” he said. “It’s about hanging on.”

Leading Biotechnology Entrepreneur and Investor Isaac Blech Joins Medgenics Board of Directors | Business Wire


























































Leading Biotechnology Entrepreneur and Investor Isaac Blech Joins 
      Medgenics Board of Directors






June 08, 2011 11:04 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MISGAV, Israel & VIENNA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medgenics, Inc. (NYSE Amex: MDGN and AIM: MEDU, MEDG) today 
      announced that Isaac Blech, age 61, a leading biotechnology entrepreneur 
      and investor, has joined the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Blech has 
      served on the Company’s Strategic Advisory Board since February 2011 and 
      is a major investor in the Company having invested over $7 million in 
      the Company over the past year. The Medgenics Board of Directors now has 
      seven members.
    

      Mr. Blech is one of the most successful private financiers in the 
      biotechnology industry. As an industry pioneer, he founded seven 
      companies, all of which were subsequently brought public. These include 
      Celgene Corporation, Genetic Systems Corporation, Icos Corporation, Nova 
      Pharmaceuticals Corporation and PathoGenesis Corporation. These 
      companies are responsible for major advances in a number of diseases 
      including the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer, chlamydia, sexual 
      dysfunction, cystic fibrosis and AIDS. Their combined value is in excess 
      of $30 billion.
    

      Mr. Blech is a major shareholder and a Director of Socialwise, Inc., an 
      innovator in e-commerce for the youth market, and is also a major 
      shareholder and Director of ContraFect Corporation, a company developing 
      therapies for infectious diseases, Mr. Blech is also a major shareholder 
      of the public companies Premier Alliance Group, a financial consulting 
      company, and Stratus Media Group, an owner, producer, promoter and 
      operator of live entertainment events. Mr. Blech is also a founder, 
      Director and major shareholder of Cerecor Inc., a private company 
      developing new treatments for central nervous system disorders.
    

      “It is with great pleasure that we welcome Isaac to our Board of 
      Directors. Isaac’s in-depth experience in biotechnology 
      commercialization and his impressive professional network should be 
      instrumental in helping us build Medgenics into a leading biotechnology 
      company pioneering personalized sustained therapy using our Biopump 
      platform for continuous production and delivery of therapeutic proteins 
      by the patient’s own skin. We look forward to Isaac’s active involvement 
      and support as a Director, as we advance our platform technology toward 
      commercialization in a number of chronic diseases,” stated Andrew L. 
      Pearlman, Ph.D., President and CEO of Medgenics.
    

      Commenting on his appointment, Isaac Blech said, “Medgenics is 
      demonstrating its ability to use a patient’s own tissue to create 
      Biopumps that, when inserted back into that patient, are designed to 
      deliver sustained production of the desired protein. This is potentially 
      a major scientific and medical breakthrough which has the ability to 
      change the treatment paradigm across a range of chronic diseases. I am 
      delighted to be working with the Medgenics team and look forward to 
      guiding them in the successful clinical development and 
      commercialization of this powerful technology.”
    

About Medgenics


      Medgenics is developing and commercializing Biopump, a proprietary 
      tissue-based platform technology for the sustained production and 
      delivery of therapeutic proteins using the patient’s own skin biopsy for 
      the treatment of a range of chronic diseases including anemia, hepatitis 
      C and hemophilia. Medgenics believes this approach has multiple benefits 
      compared with current treatments, which include regular and costly 
      injections of therapeutic proteins.
    

      Medgenics has three long-acting protein therapy products in development 
      based on this technology:
    


        EPODURE (now completing a Phase I/II dose-ranging trial) to produce 
        and deliver erythropoietin for many months from a single 
        administration, has demonstrated elevation and stabilization of 
        hemoglobin levels in anemic patients for 6 to more than 24 months;
      

        INFRADURE (to commence a Phase I/II trial in Israel in 2011) to 
        produce a sustained therapeutic dose of interferon-alpha for use in 
        the treatment hepatitis C;
      

        HEMODURE is a sustained Factor VIII therapy for the prophylactic 
        treatment of hemophilia, now in development.
      


      Medgenics intends to develop its innovative products and bring them to 
      market via strategic partnerships with major pharmaceutical and/or 
      medical device companies. Since October 2009, HEMODURE has been the 
      focus of cooperation between Medgenics and a major healthcare company, a 
      market leader in hemophilia.
    

      In addition to treatments for anemia, hepatitis C and hemophilia, 
      Medgenics plans to develop and/or out-license a pipeline of future 
      Biopump products targeting the large and rapidly growing global protein 
      therapy market, which is forecast to reach $132 billion in 2013. Other 
      potential applications for Biopumps include multiple sclerosis, 
      arthritis, pediatric growth hormone deficiency, obesity and diabetes.

Early life and education[edit]
Blech graduated from Baruch College and earned a Master's in Music Education at the Teacher's College of Columbia University.[1]
Early career[edit]
Since 1980 Mr. Blech has been a founder of companies and venture capital investor in the biotechnology sector. His initial venture investment, Genetic Systems Corporation, which he helped found with his father and his brother Isaac Blech, was built around promising scientists, including the high profile microbiologist Robert Nowinski. It developed the first inexpensive and accurate test to diagnosis sexually-transmitted diseases using monoclonal antibodies, allowing tens of thousands of babies to be born to women who otherwise would have become sterile from pelvic inflammatory disease.[2] The company was sold to Bristol Myers in 1986 for $294 million (3%) of Bristol Myers stock.[3]
In 1989, Blech co-founded Icos Corporation with Nowinski and George B. Rathmann, receiving the largest start up financing in biotech history at $33 million.

Early life and education[edit]
Blech graduated from Baruch College and earned a Master's in Music Education at the Teacher's College of Columbia University.[1]
Early career[edit]
Since 1980 Mr. Blech has been a founder of companies and venture capital investor in the biotechnology sector. His initial venture investment, Genetic Systems Corporation, which he helped found with his father and his brother Isaac Blech, was built around promising scientists, including the high profile microbiologist Robert Nowinski. It developed the first inexpensive and accurate test to diagnosis sexually-transmitted diseases using monoclonal antibodies, allowing tens of thousands of babies to be born to women who otherwise would have become sterile from pelvic inflammatory disease.[2] The company was sold to Bristol Myers in 1986 for $294 million (3%) of Bristol Myers stock.[3]
In 1989, Blech co-founded Icos Corporation with Nowinski and George B. Rathmann, receiving the largest start up financing in biotech history at $33 million. Icos discovered the drug Cialis, which was acquired by Eli Lilly in 2003 for over $2.6 billion. The Blechs also co-founded Celgene Corporation in 1986, which was a unit of the Celanese Corporation, and was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation. Celgene introduced two major cancer drugs, and has a current value of over $35 billion, making it the 5th largest biotech company in the world.[4]
Other companies he helped found include DNA Plant Technology, Neurogen Corporation, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Neurocrine Biosciences, Cytosorbents Inc, and Intellect Neurosciences.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Experience the BeenVerified Difference
See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
