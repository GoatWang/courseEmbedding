                    Investment Strategies
                    



Overview


Investment Strategies


Investment Vehicles









All of our investment strategies reflect our basic investment philosophy. That is, we identify
potential sources of return through our applied research efforts, which combine economic
theory and intuition, and are informed by decades of data across geographies and asset groups.


Alternative Investment Strategies

We have identified alternative investing strategies that have the potential to increase an overall portfolio’s expected return, decrease its risk and make it more resilient to different economic environments. With diligent care, we believe these alternative strategies can be an effective complement to traditional asset classes. 
Absolute Return



Event Driven seeks to capture mispricing between highly related securities, as when a company’s shares trade on different exchanges at different prices, or a convertible bond trades for less than the value of its components.


Fixed Income seeks to capture relative value views across issuers, industries, countries and ratings.


Macro investing seeks to benefit from mispricings and dislocations in stock, bond, currency and commodity markets by going long assets that the data suggest are undervalued and short those that are overvalued.


Managed Futures focuses on capturing trends in global stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.


Multi-Strategy offers a diversified approach to alternatives investing, seeking to provide broad exposure to several different strategies — such as arbitrage, stock selection and macro — at the same time.

Real Return investing involves actively managing a diversified portfolio of liquid, inflation-sensitive assets, designed with the objective to benefit from increases in inflation.


Stock Selection seeks to profit from market inefficiencies in individual stocks, as when a stock’s price appears higher or lower than the company’s intrinsic value indicates it should be.

Style Premia seeks to harvest the return premia from value, momentum, carry and defensive themes across asset classes and geographies.



Total Return



Long/Short Equity involves buying stocks we expect to do well and short selling those we expect to do poorly, seeking to provide investors equity-like returns with less volatility.


Risk Parity is a strategy that diversifies across global, liquid asset classes by risk, seeking to build a portfolio that is not reliant on any single asset class for long-term performance.




Traditional Investment Strategies

Our traditional strategies seek to take full advantage of sources of returns that have generated long-term outperformance in the past, and, based on our rigorous evaluation, are expected to continue to do so in the future.
Equities


Defensive Equity seeks to build a lower-risk portfolio by overweighting stocks that exhibit higher quality and are less volatile relative to an index and underweighting lower quality, more-volatile stocks.
Diversified Equities strategies employ alpha signals from our absolute return strategies and seek to beat equity benchmarks. International funds also consider the performance of each country and currency.
Momentum strategies seek to profit from the tendency of outperforming stocks to continue to outperform, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively and shown to be pervasive across markets and asset classes.
Multistyle strategies seek to outperform a benchmark, such as the Russell 1000, by focusing on stocks that are deemed attractive on the basis of factors such as valuation, momentum and profitability.



Tax-Advantaged Investing

AQR’s tax advantaged solutions aim to improve the after-tax risk-adjusted returns available to qualified investors globally.
Tax-Advantaged Alternatives



Tax-Advantaged Equity Market Neutral seeks to deliver alpha that is uncorrelated to the market, with a focus on being tax-efficient and potentially tax-beneficial across an investor's entire portfolio.




Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Investing

AQR is committed to helping our clients achieve their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals. We provide investors a variety of options to achieve their ESG objectives.
ESG Solutions

Governance-related factors are an important ingredient in our stock selection portfolios

AQR’s ESG Policy


AQR acknowledges that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors may have both direct and indirect impacts on corporate profitability, long-term portfolio performance and risk. With this in mind, our primary objective for considering ESG issues is to improve the financial characteristics of our clients’ investments.
AQR’s ESG framework is built on an economic model that considers ESG issues as externalities imposed on society that are not fully priced into the value of the company or related security. The mispricing of these externalities has the potential to encourage inappropriate corporate decisions - some of which may present investment risks while others may lead to potential profit opportunities.
Research and empiricism are at the core of AQR and we believe in applying an objective research process to evaluate the merits and efficacy of all investment strategies, including ESG criteria. We look for investment criteria or signals that are firmly grounded in economic theory and lead to measurable improvements in risk-adjusted returns.
We recognize that investors may have other motivations for ESG investing, including upholding value or ethical standards and/or promoting ESG accountability of companies to benefit society as a whole. AQR believes it can best address these preferences in client-specific mandates that are customized for each investor’s unique preferences and circumstances.
In applying our ESG Philosophy, AQR has adopted the following guiding principles:

AQR will embrace research and education on ESG criteria in pursuit of continuous improvement to our understanding of the risk and opportunities to our clients, our investment strategies, and our business.
AQR will consider incorporating ESG investment ideas on an equal footing with other investment ideas. In all mandates, ESG investment ideas will be implemented to the extent they are driven by improvement to risk and portfolio return characteristics. In segregated mandates, AQR will also work with clients to implement solutions that reflect client-specific views on moral, social, environmental or governance issues.
AQR will be transparent with respect to its progress on ESG research and implementation solutions.
AQR will ensure it has the resources available to adhere to these guiding principles and to aid clients in their understanding of ESG-based investing.









AQR does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice. Investors should conduct his or her own analysis and consult with professional advisors prior to making any investment decisions.

Alternative Thinking 1Q 2017: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes


Topic:
Asset Allocation, Portfolio Management



This issue of Capital Market Assumptions updates our multi-year expected returns for major asset classes. Compared to historical averages, we are still very much in a world of low expected returns.
In this year’s edition, we modify our equity expected return methodologies to account for the growing corporate substitution of share buybacks for dividends. The topic is explored in greater depth in an Appendix which discusses specific details and presents the underlying theory and practical guidance on the data required to build these estimates.

Superstar Investors Webinar | December 13, 2016


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch are some of the most well-known investors of our time, but there has been little empirical analysis to explain their performance. In this webinar, Jordan Brooks and Dan Villalon examine the track records of these “superstars” from a factor perspective to see if their investment philosophies — applied systematically — can help demystify their long-term alpha.

Alternative Thinking 4Q 2016: Superstar Investors


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Many famous investors are outspoken about their investment philosophies, and carefully apply them to a select number of securities. In this Alternative Thinking, we seek to apply their wisdom systematically; to ask whether their philosophies applied broadly might still generate “alpha”.
Our analysis suggests there are many ways to achieve long-run investment success. The takeaway for investors is to identify structural edges and commit to seeing them through inevitable periods of underperformance. As each of our superstars shows, “merely good” edges over time may compound to great long-term performance.

Can Value Timing Improve a Style Portfolio?

Just like asset classes, styles - or factors - can become cheaper or more expensive than average. In this webinar, Cliff Asness and Ronen Israel discuss whether this information can be used to build a better style portfolio, and compare value timing to strategic diversification for style investors.
