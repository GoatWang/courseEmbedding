Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs


USA - OFI Global







About Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs

The Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs offer exposure to the OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Strategy, and are linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (BXIIOSMS). The Index Constituents are selected for inclusion in the Index based on certain eligibility criteria, including distribution payment history, lower relative correlation to oil and natural gas prices, and size as measured by free-float market capitalization and average daily trading value.View OSMS product summary

Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and is a registered US broker-dealer regulated by the SEC and FINRA. 








 





An investment in any ETNs linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (the "ETNs")  involves significant risks and may not be  suitable for all investors.  Selected  risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus  supplement and pricing supplement.  
You May Lose Some or All of  Your Principal:  The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the  Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level between the inception date and the  applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the VWAP level is insufficient to  offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you  will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even  if the VWAP value has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor  fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower  than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.    The ETNs are riskier than ordinary  unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit  of Barclays Bank PLC:  The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the  ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the  ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In  addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations,  you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. 
Issuer  Redemption: Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to  redeem or "call" the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and  without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until  and including maturity.  
The Payment on the ETNs is  Linked to the VWAP Level, Not to the Closing Level of the Index and Not to the  Published Intraday Indicative Value of the ETNs. Your payment at maturity  or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the VWAP level, as  compared to the initial VWAP level. Although the VWAP level is intended to  track the performance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP level is  different from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index.  Therefore, the payment at maturity or early redemption of your ETNs, may be  different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by  reference to the official closing level of the Index. 
No Guaranteed Coupon  Payments: You  are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the ETNs. You will receive a  coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued  dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation  date. The amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends  in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder  would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior  to the relevant coupon valuation date. 
Market and Volatility Risk: The  return on the ETNs is linked to the performance of the VWAP level of the Index  which, in turn, is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships  and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time. The  prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and, as a result,  affect the level of the Index and the value of your ETNs in unforeseeable ways. 
Concentration Risk: The  index constituents are companies in the Midstream  Oil & Gas and Liquid  Petroleum and Natural Gas Shippers categories, as determined by the Bloomberg  Industry Classification System® ("BCIS"). In addition, many of the  Index Constituents are smaller, non-diversified businesses that are exposed to  the risks associated with such businesses, including the lack of capital  funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger,  better financed and more diversified businesses. The ETNs are susceptible to  general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy  business MLP market and to volatile increases and decreases in value, as market  confidence in, and perceptions regarding the index constituents change. Your  investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities  investment in one industry or sector.
A Trading Market for the  ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a  U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not  develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to  maintain any listing of the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum  Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs at one time in order to exercise your  right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs  on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain  dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement. Uncertain Tax Treatment:  Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs may be less favorable than  a direct investment in MLPs and are uncertain. You should consult your own tax  advisor about your own tax situation.Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration  statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting www.etn.barclays.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by  calling toll-free 1-877-764-7284, or you may request a copy  from any other dealer participating in the offering.
OppenheimerFunds  Distributor, Inc. ("OFDI"), doing business as OFI Global Asset Management,  assists in the promotion of the Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs. OFDI is not affiliated  with Barclays Capital Inc. or Barclays Bank PLC.
  The  ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage  account. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of  sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs.

Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. Each Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations, which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds. The Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds are subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in an Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Funds are organized as Subchapter “C” Corporations and are subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depends on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution, which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result an MLP fund’s after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

Product Summary




Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETN 






The Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs (the ETNs) are linked to the Volume-Weighted Average Price ("VWAP")1 level of the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (the "Index"). The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level of the Index between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks and may not be suitable for all investors 
The Index is designed to track the performance of a basket of direct interests in master limited partnerships and limited liability companies (collectively, the "Index Constituents") organized in the United States that trade on certain U.S. exchanges, are classified in the Midstream Oil & Gas category or Liquid Petroleum & Natural Gas Shippers category according to the Bloomberg Industry Classification System® ("BICS") and meet certain eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Index, including their distribution payment history and their size as measured by free-float market capitalization and average daily trading value. Owning the ETNs is not the same as owning interests in the Index Constituents or a security directly linked to the performance of the Index. An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks and may not be suitable for all investors. For more information on risks associated with the ETNs, please see Selected Risk Considerations below and the risk factors included in the relevant prospectus.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold or redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost.  Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.  See additional information below for how return figures are calculated.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTSIntraday  Indicative Value. The "intraday indicative value" meant to approximate  the value of the ETNs during the current trading day by reference to the  underlying index is calculated and published during the course of each trading  day.  The intraday indicative value is  intended to provide investors with an approximation of the effect that intraday  changes in the level of the underlying index would have on the closing  indicative value of the ETNs.  The  intraday indicative value only reflects the accrued investor fee and other  applicable costs at the close of business on the preceding day, but does not  include any adjustment for the investor fee or applicable costs accruing during  the course of the current day.  For more  information on how the intraday indicative value is calculated, please see the  section “Valuation of the ETNs” in the prospectus relating to the ETNs.   The intraday indicative value is provided for reference purposes only. It  is not intended as a price or quotation, or as an offer or solicitation for the  purchase, sale, redemption or termination of the ETNs, nor does it reflect  hedging or transaction costs, credit considerations, market liquidity, or  bid-offer spreads. Published index levels from the sponsors of the indices  underlying the ETNs may occasionally be subject to delay or postponement. Any  such delays or postponements will affect the level of the index and therefore  the intraday indicative value of the ETNs. Index levels provided by the  sponsors of the indices underlying the ETNs do not necessarily reflect the  depth and liquidity of the underlying markets for the index components. For  this reason and others, the actual trading price of the ETNs may be different  from their intraday indicative value.
The investor  fee rate per ETN is 085% per year.  The daily fee value (or daily investor fee) on any calendar day is equal to the product of (1) the closing VWAP level on such calendar day divided by the VWAP factor and (2) the investor fee rate divided by 365.  Because the daily fee value is calculated and subtracted from the closing indicative note value on a daily basis, the net effect of the fee accumulates over time and is subtracted at the rate of 0.85% per year. .  Because the net effect of the investor fee is a fixed percentage of the value of each ETN, the aggregate effect of the investor fee will increase or decrease in a manner directly proportional to the value of each ETN and the amount of the ETNs that are held, as applicable.The VWAP factor is 5.2540, which is equal to (1) the initial VWAP level divided by (2) the principal amount per ETN.  If the ETNs undergo a split or reverse split, the VWAP factor will be adjusted accordingly.  The VWAP factor represents the initial exposure of each ETN to the initial VWAP level of the Index.  The initial VWAP level was 131.35, which was the VWAP level at the closing of trading on the inception date. 
Market Capitalization = Closing Indicative  Note Value x ETNs Outstanding.
The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) with respect to each Index Constituent, on any index business day, the consolidated volume-weighted average price of one unit of such Index Constituent as determined by the VWAP calculation agent based on all trades in such Index Constituent reported in the consolidated tape system during the regular trading session.  The VWAP Level on an index business day, as calculated by the VWAP calculation agent, (1) the sum of the products of (i) the VWAP of each Index Constituent as of such date plus (ii) the number of units of that Index Constituent as of such date published by the index sponsor.

An investment in any ETNs linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (the "ETNs")  involves significant risks and may not be  suitable for all investors.  Selected  risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus  supplement and pricing supplement.  
You May Lose Some or All of  Your Principal:  The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the  Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level between the inception date and the  applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the VWAP level is insufficient to  offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you  will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even  if the VWAP value has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor  fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower  than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.    The ETNs are riskier than ordinary  unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit  of Barclays Bank PLC:  The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the  ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the  ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In  addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations,  you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. 
Issuer  Redemption: Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to  redeem or "call" the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and  without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until  and including maturity.  
The Payment on the ETNs is  Linked to the VWAP Level, Not to the Closing Level of the Index and Not to the  Published Intraday Indicative Value of the ETNs. Your payment at maturity  or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the VWAP level, as  compared to the initial VWAP level. Although the VWAP level is intended to  track the performance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP level is  different from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index.  Therefore, the payment at maturity or early redemption of your ETNs, may be  different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by  reference to the official closing level of the Index. 
No Guaranteed Coupon  Payments: You  are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the ETNs. You will receive a  coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued  dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation  date. The amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends  in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder  would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior  to the relevant coupon valuation date. 
Market and Volatility Risk: The  return on the ETNs is linked to the performance of the VWAP level of the Index  which, in turn, is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships  and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time. The  prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and, as a result,  affect the level of the Index and the value of your ETNs in unforeseeable ways. 
Concentration Risk: The  index constituents are companies in the Midstream  Oil & Gas and Liquid  Petroleum and Natural Gas Shippers categories, as determined by the Bloomberg  Industry Classification System® ("BCIS"). In addition, many of the  Index Constituents are smaller, non-diversified businesses that are exposed to  the risks associated with such businesses, including the lack of capital  funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger,  better financed and more diversified businesses. The ETNs are susceptible to  general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy  business MLP market and to volatile increases and decreases in value, as market  confidence in, and perceptions regarding the index constituents change. Your  investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities  investment in one industry or sector.
A Trading Market for the  ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a  U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not  develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to  maintain any listing of the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum  Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs at one time in order to exercise your  right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs  on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain  dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement. Uncertain Tax Treatment:  Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs may be less favorable than  a direct investment in MLPs and are uncertain. You should consult your own tax  advisor about your own tax situation.Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration  statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting www.etn.barclays.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by  calling toll-free 1-877-764-7284, or you may request a copy  from any other dealer participating in the offering.

ETN and Index Historical Performance






Source: Barclays, Bloomberg.
The chart above shows the historical performance of the ETN and the Index from the ETN Inception Date which was April 23, 2014 to the previous days closing price.
The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold or redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost.  Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.  See additional information below for how return figures are calculated.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS
ETN Closing Indicative Note Value Returns
ETN closing indicative note value returns show the  change in the closing indicative value of the ETNs over the relevant period,  expressed as a percentage. The closing indicative note value of an ETN is an  amount per ETN calculated on each valuation date that reflects the change in  value of the ETN from the previous valuation date due to the daily change in  the index level and the daily accrual of the investor fee and other applicable  costs.  The closing indicative note value  of an ETN may differ from the actual trading price of the ETN at any time due  to hedging or transaction costs, credit considerations, market liquidity,  bid-offer spreads or other factors affecting the trading price of the ETN.  For more information on how the closing  indicative note value is calculated, please see the section “Specific Terms of  the ETNs” in the prospectus relating to the ETNs.

Index returns show the change in the level of the  index underlying the ETNs over the relevant period, expressed as a  percentage.  Index returns are calculated  using the closing index level from the beginning of the relevant period to the  end of the relevant period.  For any  historical period of one year or longer, index returns are shown on an annualized  basis.  Index returns are for illustrative  purposes only and do not represent actual ETN performance. Index returns do not  reflect any management fees, transaction costs, or expenses which would reduce  your actual return, including the investor fee and applicable costs of the  ETNs. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index..



An investment in any ETNs linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (the "ETNs")  involves significant risks and may not be  suitable for all investors.  Selected  risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus  supplement and pricing supplement.  
You May Lose Some or All of  Your Principal:  The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the  Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level between the inception date and the  applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the VWAP level is insufficient to  offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you  will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even  if the VWAP value has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor  fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower  than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.    The ETNs are riskier than ordinary  unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit  of Barclays Bank PLC:  The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the  ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the  ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In  addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations,  you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. 
Issuer  Redemption: Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to  redeem or "call" the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and  without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until  and including maturity.  
The Payment on the ETNs is  Linked to the VWAP Level, Not to the Closing Level of the Index and Not to the  Published Intraday Indicative Value of the ETNs. Your payment at maturity  or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the VWAP level, as  compared to the initial VWAP level. Although the VWAP level is intended to  track the performance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP level is  different from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index.  Therefore, the payment at maturity or early redemption of your ETNs, may be  different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by  reference to the official closing level of the Index. 
No Guaranteed Coupon  Payments: You  are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the ETNs. You will receive a  coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued  dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation  date. The amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends  in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder  would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior  to the relevant coupon valuation date. 
Market and Volatility Risk: The  return on the ETNs is linked to the performance of the VWAP level of the Index  which, in turn, is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships  and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time. The  prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and, as a result,  affect the level of the Index and the value of your ETNs in unforeseeable ways. 
Concentration Risk: The  index constituents are companies in the Midstream  Oil & Gas and Liquid  Petroleum and Natural Gas Shippers categories, as determined by the Bloomberg  Industry Classification System® ("BCIS"). In addition, many of the  Index Constituents are smaller, non-diversified businesses that are exposed to  the risks associated with such businesses, including the lack of capital  funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger,  better financed and more diversified businesses. The ETNs are susceptible to  general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy  business MLP market and to volatile increases and decreases in value, as market  confidence in, and perceptions regarding the index constituents change. Your  investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities  investment in one industry or sector.
A Trading Market for the  ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a  U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not  develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to  maintain any listing of the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum  Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs at one time in order to exercise your  right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs  on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain  dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement. Uncertain Tax Treatment:  Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs may be less favorable than  a direct investment in MLPs and are uncertain. You should consult your own tax  advisor about your own tax situation.Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration  statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting www.etn.barclays.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by  calling toll-free 1-877-764-7284, or you may request a copy  from any other dealer participating in the offering.

Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index Index Sector Weightings (as of 06/30/2016)





Source: Barclays, subject to change.


An investment in any ETNs linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (the "ETNs")  involves significant risks and may not be  suitable for all investors.  Selected  risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus  supplement and pricing supplement.  
You May Lose Some or All of  Your Principal:  The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the  Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level between the inception date and the  applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the VWAP level is insufficient to  offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you  will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even  if the VWAP value has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor  fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower  than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.    The ETNs are riskier than ordinary  unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit  of Barclays Bank PLC:  The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the  ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the  ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In  addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations,  you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. 
Issuer  Redemption: Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to  redeem or "call" the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and  without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until  and including maturity.  
The Payment on the ETNs is  Linked to the VWAP Level, Not to the Closing Level of the Index and Not to the  Published Intraday Indicative Value of the ETNs. Your payment at maturity  or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the VWAP level, as  compared to the initial VWAP level. Although the VWAP level is intended to  track the performance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP level is  different from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index.  Therefore, the payment at maturity or early redemption of your ETNs, may be  different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by  reference to the official closing level of the Index. 
No Guaranteed Coupon  Payments: You  are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the ETNs. You will receive a  coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued  dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation  date. The amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends  in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder  would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior  to the relevant coupon valuation date. 
Market and Volatility Risk: The  return on the ETNs is linked to the performance of the VWAP level of the Index  which, in turn, is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships  and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time. The  prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and, as a result,  affect the level of the Index and the value of your ETNs in unforeseeable ways. 
Concentration Risk: The  index constituents are companies in the Midstream  Oil & Gas and Liquid  Petroleum and Natural Gas Shippers categories, as determined by the Bloomberg  Industry Classification System® ("BCIS"). In addition, many of the  Index Constituents are smaller, non-diversified businesses that are exposed to  the risks associated with such businesses, including the lack of capital  funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger,  better financed and more diversified businesses. The ETNs are susceptible to  general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy  business MLP market and to volatile increases and decreases in value, as market  confidence in, and perceptions regarding the index constituents change. Your  investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities  investment in one industry or sector.
A Trading Market for the  ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a  U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not  develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to  maintain any listing of the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum  Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs at one time in order to exercise your  right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs  on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain  dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement. Uncertain Tax Treatment:  Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs may be less favorable than  a direct investment in MLPs and are uncertain. You should consult your own tax  advisor about your own tax situation.Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration  statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting www.etn.barclays.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by  calling toll-free 1-877-764-7284, or you may request a copy  from any other dealer participating in the offering.

ETN Coupon


For each ETN that you hold on the applicable coupon record date, you will receive an interest payment in cash per ETN on each coupon payment date in U.S. dollars equal to the coupon amount, if any, on the applicable coupon valuation date.  The coupon amount on any coupon valuation date will equal the greater of (i) zero and (ii)(1) the accrued dividend on such coupon valuation date minus (2) the accrued investor fee on such coupon valuation date.  There is no guarantee that the ETNs will pay coupon.   If on any coupon valuation date the accrued fees are greater than the accrued dividend, you will not receive a coupon payment on the applicable coupon payment date.  The value of any distributions in respect of any Index Constituents occurring after a coupon valuation date but before the immediately following coupon ex-date will not be reflected in the accrued dividend on such coupon valuation date and, therefore, will not be reflected in the coupon amount payable on the corresponding coupon payment date

The coupon adjustment dividend amount will equal zero on any calendar day that is not a coupon ex-date.  On any calendar day that is a coupon ex-date, the coupon adjustment dividend amount will equal the accrued dividend on the coupon valuation date immediately preceding such coupon ex-date.
The accrued dividend on the initial valuation date will equal zero.  The accrued dividend on any subsequent calendar day will equal (1) the accrued dividend as of the immediately preceding calendar day plus (2) the dollar dividend value on such calendar day minus (3) the coupon adjustment dividend amount on such calendar day.  If the ETNs undergo a split or reverse split, the accrued dividend will be adjusted accordingly
The dollar dividend value on any calendar day will equal (1) the index dividend on such calendar day divided by (2) the VWAP factor.
On any calendar day that is not a coupon ex-date, the coupon adjustment dividend amount will equal zero.  On any calendar day that is a coupon ex-date, the coupon adjustment dividend amount will equal the accrued dividend on the coupon valuation date immediately preceding such coupon ex-date.
The accrued investor fee on the initial valuation date will equal zero.  The accrued investor fee on any subsequent calendar day will equal (1) the accrued investor fee as of the immediately preceding calendar day plus (2) the daily fee value on such calendar day minus (3) the coupon adjustment fee amount on such calendar day.  If the ETNs undergo a split or reverse split, the accrued investor fee will be adjusted accordingly.
On any calendar day that is not a coupon ex-date, the coupon adjustment fee amount will equal zero.  On any calendar day that is a coupon ex-date, the coupon adjustment fee amount will equal (i) the coupon adjustment dividend amount on such coupon ex-date, if the coupon amount in respect of such coupon-ex date is zero or (ii) the accrued investor fee on the coupon valuation date immediately preceding such coupon ex-date, if the coupon amount in respect of such coupon-ex date is greater than zero.







Source: Barclays, subject to change.1"Current Yield" equals the current Coupon Amount annualized and divided by the relevant closing indicative value of the ETNs, rounded for ease of analysis. The relevant closing indicative value is the closing indicative value of the ETNs referenced in the coupon declaration press release issued for that coupon payment. Coupon payments are calculated and paid in accordance with the terms described in the relevant product prospectus.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.
