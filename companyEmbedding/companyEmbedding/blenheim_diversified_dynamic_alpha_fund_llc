Blenheim Diversified Dynamic
Alpha Fund, L.L.C.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Diversified Dynamic Alpha Fund (DDA), which is managed by Blenheim Fund Management LLC (the "Manager"), is based on Global Macro and GTAA strategies, and aims to achieve consistent risk-adjusted absolute returns. The Fund has retained Blenheim Capital Management, B.V. (the "Advisor") as its trading advisor to implement these strategies. The top-down investment strategy builds on the investment philosophy of time-varying returns on risky assets within and across global equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, inflation and volatility that can be exploited over different investment horizons using various investment approaches and skills. Most of the positions are directional in nature and are implemented using mostly liquid instruments. The ability to go long and short global markets safeguards low correlation with the underlying markets over the long term. AUM is not disclosed.
