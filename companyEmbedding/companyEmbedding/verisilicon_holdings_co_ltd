We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $     million, or approximately $     million if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional ADSs from us, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial
offering price of $     per ADS, the midpoint of the initial public offering
price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. Each $1.00 change in
the assumed initial public offering price of $     per ADS would, in the case of
an increase, increase and, in the case of a decrease, decrease, the net proceeds
we receive from this offering by approximately $     million, or approximately
$     million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional ADSs from us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each one million
ADS increase (decrease) in the number of ADSs offered by us would increase
(decrease) the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately
$     million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price of $       per
ADS remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. The amount of
estimated net proceeds discussed above is illustrative only and the actual net
proceeds will be determined in part by the actual public offering price and
number of ADSs sold by us and the other terms of this offering.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our ADSs and to facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes.

If Shadow Preference Shares are issued in connection with this offering, we will
use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to redeem Shadow Preference
Shares. Whether or not we are required to issue Shadow Preference Shares, and
the number of Shadow Preference Shares that we may be required to issue and
therefore redeem, will depend on the Midpoint of the Price Range per ADS set
forth on the cover page of the Last Preliminary Prospectus. The number of Shadow 
Preference Shares we may be required to issue will also depend on the number of 
ADSs we are offering as set forth on the cover page of the Last Preliminary 
Prospectus and the number of our fully diluted ordinary shares on the day prior 
to the date of that Last Preliminary Prospectus, and information in this 
paragraph is based on the number of our fully diluted ordinary shares as of 
December 31, 2014 and assumes that there will be no change in the number of ADSs 
we are offering from that set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. 
Subject to the foregoing and assuming that the Midpoint of the Price Range per 
ADS appearing on the cover page of the Last Preliminary Prospectus is equal to 
the midpoint of the initial public offering price range per ADS appearing on the 
cover of this prospectus, and further assuming that all outstanding warrants to 
purchase our Series C Preference Shares, Series D Preference Shares and Series 
E Preference Shares are exercised for cash, we would be required to issue a 
total of approximately          Shadow Preference Shares and to redeem those 
Shadow Preference Shares upon completion of this offering for an aggregate cash 
redemption price of approximately $         million. However, if this prospectus 
is not the Last Preliminary Prospectus, and if the Midpoint of the Price Range 
or the number of ADSs we are offering as set forth on the cover page of the Last 
Preliminary Prospectus differs from the midpoint of the initial public offering  
price range per ADS or number of ADSs set forth on the cover page of this 
prospectus, then the number of Shadow Preference Shares we may be required to 
issue and the aggregate redemption price of those Shadow Preference Shares will 
differ from the amounts set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. 
Likewise, we calculated the foregoing number of Shadow Preference Shares and 
their aggregate redemption price based on the number of our fully diluted 
ordinary shares as of December 31, 2014, and there have been changes in the 
number of our fully diluted ordinary shares since that date that will affect  
this calculation. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering
for acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. We
have not entered into any agreements or commitments with respect to any specific
acquisitions and have no understandings or agreements with respect to any such
acquisition at this time.

Pending application of the net proceeds from this offering for the foregoing 
purposes, we may invest such net proceeds in bank accounts or other short term 
investments. 

Except for any net proceeds we may be required to use to redeem Shadow 
Preference Shares, we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the 
net proceeds to be received by us from this offering. Accordingly, our 
management team will have broad discretion in using the net proceeds to be 
received by us from this offering. Chinese law may limit or prevent us from 
investing net proceeds in or loaning net proceeds to our PRC subsidiaries and 
our ability to use net proceeds from this offering in China is subject to 
significant uncertainty.


The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our
services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our
customers’ products, design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints. 
Technology in the markets for which we provide solutions evolves rapidly and is 
characterized by frequent introductions and improvements and changes in industry 
standards and customer requirements. Semiconductor device functionality 
requirements continually increase while feature size decreases, substantially 
increasing the complexity, cost and risk of semiconductor design and 
manufacturing. At the same time, our customers and potential customers continue 
to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the 
consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. In order to succeed in this 
environment, we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements 
and increase the value of our services, while also striving to reduce their 
overall costs and our own operating costs. 

Many of the products in which our IP is incorporated, are in the consumer
electronics sector, such as mobile devices, which is a highly competitive
sector. Aggressive competition in the consumer electronics markets could result
in substantial declines in the license fees and royalty rates that we are able
to charge our customers for our IP, as well as the number of turnkey and NRE
projects that we generate. In the past, some of our competitors have sought to
increase their share of certain markets by reducing their license fees and
royalty rates or the fees that they charge for their design or engineering
services and may do so in the future.

We face competition from a large number of companies, including the following
primary competitors:

. in our turnkey and NRE design services businesses, we compete primarily 
  against Global Unichip Corp., Faraday Technology Corporation, eSilicon 
  Corporation and Open-Silicon, Inc.; and 
 
. in our license and royalty business, we compete against a large number of 
  companies who design and license their own technologies, including Ceva Inc., 
  Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc. in the design of DSP solutions 
  and Imagination Technologies Group PLC and Chips&Media, Inc. in the design of 
  video processing solutions. 
 
We also compete with internal engineering teams at semiconductor companies. When
these companies design IP or complete designs in-house, we lose an opportunity
to generate revenue in licensing and royalties, our NRE design services or
turnkey products categories.

We expect that as the markets for our solutions grow, new entrants will enter
these markets and existing competitors may make significant investments to
compete more effectively against us. As each of these markets in which we
compete become developed markets, leading semiconductor companies focusing on
developed markets may increasingly enter our target markets.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside
of our control, including:

. the functionality and performance of our solutions and those of our 
  competitors; 
 
. our relationship with our customers and other industry participants; 
 
. prices of our NRE design services, turnkey products and IP licenses and 
  prices of our competitors’ solutions; 
 
. our ability to provide our NRE design services in a timely fashion; 
 
. our reputation and ability to provide satisfactory customer support; 
 
. our research and development capabilities to provide innovative solutions; 
 
. our ability to retain high-level talent, including our management team and 
  engineers; and 
 
. our ability to protect our IP. 
 
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. However, many of
our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater
name recognition, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater
financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other
resources than us. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to 
changing customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development, 
promotion and sales of their solutions than we can. Our competitors may develop 
and introduce new solutions that have lower prices, provide superior 
performance, provide greater processing power or achieve greater market 
acceptance than our solutions. It is possible that new competitors or alliances 
among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market 
share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and 
operating results. If we fail to compete successfully, our business would suffer 
and we may lose or be unable to gain market share.


Company Description
Our business model, which we refer to as Silicon Platform as a Service (SiPaaS),
is an IP-centric, platform-based, end-to-end semiconductor design service, which
enables us to provide custom silicon solutions. Our mission is to mitigate the
time, cost, and risks of semiconductor design and


 manufacturing for
semiconductor companies, original equipment manufacturers, original design
manufacturers and large Internet platform companies, allowing them to focus on
their core competencies such as product definition, system architecture,
software development and branding. Our business model is designed to enable the
semiconductor industry to transition to a design-lite model, similar to the way
in which independent wafer foundries gave rise to the fabless semiconductor
industry by providing access to independent, advanced semiconductor
manufacturing services.

We are a SiPaaS company that provides our customers with the ability to rapidly,
efficiently and effectively bring to market custom silicon solutions that
address a wide range of applications across a variety of end markets, including
mobile devices, networking, the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable electronics,
smart homes and automotive electronics. We believe that the breadth and
flexibility of our SiPaaS solution make it a compelling alternative development
model designed to reduce operating expenses and improve return on investment for
our customers, which include both emerging and established semiconductor
companies, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design
manufacturers (ODMs) and large Internet platform companies involved in the
development of proprietary systems technology. Our SiPaaS solution offers
end-to-end semiconductor design services, from architectural design and physical
implementation to managing the manufacturing and shipping of fully packaged and
tested semiconductor devices. We originated the term SiPaaS to describe our
business model, but we believe that it also describes a developing trend towards
engaging third parties for the design and production of custom silicon
solutions.

Our SiPaaS solution consists of our system on a chip (SoC) platforms, which are
differentiated by our broad, licensable intellectual property (IP) portfolio
that includes digital signal processor (DSP) IP, high definition (HD) video IP,
over 1,000 proprietary reusable units of mixed signal and radio frequency (RF)
IP for processes ranging from 180nm to 28nm bulk complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) and 28nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI),
foundation libraries (standard cell, memory compiler and input/output (I/O)),
and third-party IP. As of December 31, 2014, we had 49 patents issued and five
patents pending in the U.S. and five patents issued and 13 patents pending in
China. Each of our SoC platforms integrates key components of one or more of our
families of IP and can be optimized for a variety of applications such as HD
video, HD audio, HD voice, wireless baseband, and human user interface (HUI),
which includes technologies related to voice recognition, 3D motion sensing, and
handwriting recognition.

We believe our manufacturing and product engineering experience makes our
business scalable by being in a position to offer a wide variety of services
across many different types of processes, technologies and target markets. Our
manufacturing and product engineering services include test hardware and test
software, rapid prototype validation, device qualification, engineering 
prototype to volume production, yield management, failure analysis, and quality 
and reliability management for SoC and system in a package (SiP) products. By 
using these services, our customers can benefit from shortened design cycles, 
enhanced product performance and quality, and reduced costs. 

Our SiPaaS solution is vendor neutral, positioning us to utilize a best-in-class
approach for our customers for whom we can leverage our deep relationships that
span the semiconductor ecosystem, including electronic design automation (EDA)
and IP companies, wafer foundries, and packaging and testing vendors.

Our global, diversified customer base included over 200 customers in 2014. Since
2009, over one billion chips have been manufactured based on our custom silicon
solutions and over 700 million chips have been shipped using our IP from which
we have collected royalties. For the five years ended December 31, 2014, we
have, on average, completed one tape out each week. A tape out refers to the
final result of the design process for integrated circuits (the point at which
the design is sent to the foundry to begin manufacturing). For the two years
ended December 31, 2014, over 97% of the designs for these products were
qualified in accordance with the customers’ specifications in the initial tape
out without any significant re-designs, which we refer to as first silicon
success.

We generate revenue from (i) sales of turnkey products, (ii) non-recurring 
engineering (NRE) design services and (iii) license fees and royalties generated

	 | Products | IP

ounded
 in 2002, VeriSilicon Holdings Co., Ltd. ("VeriSilicon") is a fast 
growing IC (integrated circuit) design foundry providing custom silicon 
solutions and SoC (System-on-A-chip) turnkey services. With four R&D
 centers in China (Shanghai & Beijing) and US (Santa Clara & 
Dallas), VeriSilicon's technology solutions combine licensable digital 
signal processing (ZSP) cores, eDRAM, value-added mixed signal IP 
portfolio and other star IP into a SoC platform that extends below 65nm 
process technology. These platforms benefit a wide range of consumer 
electronics devices such as set top box and Home Gateway, mobile 
internet device and Cellular Phone, HDTV and Blu-ray DVD Player. 
VeriSilicon's design and manufacturing service provides differentiation 
based on specific customer requirement that ranges from initial SoC 
specification and application software, RTL and backend design 
implementation through silicon samples and volume production, utilizing 
multiple foundry partners, assembly and test companies in Asia and US.  
Products
Product Name: ARM CoresProduct Category: 
		 Design Verification 

VeriSilicon has licensed a range of ARM® processors, including the ARM7TDMI® processor, the ARM922TTM processor and the ARM926EJ-STM processor to expand its product portfolio and enable the development of advanced SoC systems that meet the rapidly evolving requirements of digital consumer devices.

		 Design Verification 

VeriSilicon's V.Blox 
IP Library of industry proven semiconductor IP includes a comprehensive 
selection of commonly required functional "building blocks" that offer 
ease of integration and verification - providing further reliability, 
risk reduction and time-to-market advantages in the development of 
complex SoC's and ASICs.
Product Name: V.Library Foundry LibrariesProduct Category: 
		 Design Verification 

VeriSilicon's
 V.Libs Foundry Libraries (V.Libs) include a wide range of foundry 
specific semiconductor IP. V.Libs are optimized for different 
performance criteria (power, performance, area) and include the 
following IP types: standard cell libraries, I/O cell libraries and 
memory compilers. To date, more than 500 customers worldwide have 
downloaded a V.Libs for a wide range and complexity of designs, such as 
multi-million gates SoCs (embedding ARM7 designs, 32-bit MCU designs), 
and have achieved "first silicon success" with volume production.
Product Name: VSI407USProduct Category: 
		 Design Verification 

The VSI407US is a 
low-cost, low-power voice processor in an ultra-thin package that 
delivers the perfect mix of high performance and small footprint 
necessary in Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) applications such as cell phones, 
PDAs and other handheld devices. 
Product Name: VZ.AudioHDProduct Category: 
		 Design Verification 

Over the last few years, the push for high definition multimedia devices has been pretty clear.  Initially,
 this category has been dominated by the success in the HDTV space, 
fueled by dramatic price reduction of flat panel displays, but several 
other products are now beginning to make traction in the market place.  Next
 generation DVD players, Blu-Ray and HD-DVD, constitute a fast-growing 
portion of this space and according to the Santa Clara Consulting Group,
 will represent a $4 B market by 2010.  These devices also present enormous design challenges when compared to existing DVD players.  For
 example, audio performance requirements have increased several-fold to 
support new high-quality audio standards as well as complex use cases 
encompassing a large number of different audio technologies. To address 
these requirements, the fully integrated VZ.AudioHD platform includes a 
wide assortment of pre-optimized high-end audio software modules, 
high-performance ZSP800 processor, and system software framework.
Product Name: ZSP200Product Category: 
		 Design Verification 

The
 VeriSilicon ZSP200 is a fully synthesizable, low cost DSP core that can
 be easily integrated into and programmed in your system-on-a-chip 
design. The ZSP200 DSP core enables optimal cost and power saving in 
applications where a microprocessor cannot deliver the DSP performance 
required. ZSP200 is available with AMBA master/slave interfaces and a 
range of supporting peripherals for audio and voice applications. 
Whether you choose the soft macro or hard macro version, the ZSP200 is 
ideally suited to help you get your product to market quickly.
Product Name: ZSPneoProduct Category: 
		 Design Verification 

ZSPneo is a new breed of processor that combines the capabilities of the DSP and the MCU on a single core. It is ideal for cost sensitive applications that require control processing performance above the existing 8-bit microcontrollers, but cannot tolerate the unnecessary cost of the 32-bit microcontrollers.

      start-up, GetThere, which had a successful IPO on NASDAQ in 1999 and was 
      later acquired by Sabre. Mr. Brown held various financial positions at 
      Hewlett-Packard after starting his career in corporate banking for 
      Security Pacific National Bank (now Bank of America). Over the course of 
      his career, he has played a key role in M&A transactions and financings 
      valued at over $20 billion, including the sale of LSI to Avago 
      Technologies for $6.6 billion in May 2014. He received his Bachelor of 
      Science degree from Miami University and Master of Business
