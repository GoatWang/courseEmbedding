Why Ferroglobe PLC's Shares Popped 19% Today
Fourth-quarter earnings may be better than expected and 2017 could see conditions improve further.

What happened
Shares of metal and specialty products producer Ferroglobe PLC (NASDAQ:GSM) jumped as much as 19.2% in early trading Wednesday after giving an earnings update to investors. By 11:45 p.m. EST shares had settled down slightly to a 13.8% gain for the day.
So what
Management said market conditions stabilized in the fourth quarter and estimates revenue will be $400 million to $405 million while net loss will be $37 million to $51 million. By comparison, analysts were only expecting revenue of $385 million in the quarter.
The company has also agreed to sell its Spanish hydro-electric assets for $270 million in gross proceeds. It may also sell its hydro-electric operations in France.
In a separate release, management announced that it has launched an offering of $350 million in Senior Notes due 2022. Pricing isn't set yet but the funds are expected to be used to reduce debt and pay expenses owed to the company's former Executive Chairman.





Now what
It looks like Ferroglobe's future is a little brighter on Wednesday than investors expected and the good news isn't completely seen in fourth-quarter results. Rising prices for the company's products won't fully hit until later this year when contracts run out and pricing adjusts. When it does the hope is that the company will be able to quickly increase profitability. For now, investors are liking what they see.

Foundry products





Operating worldwide, Ferroglobe is a specialist in inoculation and nodularization techniques in use within the iron foundry industry. Led by a team of foundry experts we answer foundry inoculation and nodularization challenges.  






We produce numerous varieties of foundry products.
All of these are ferrosilicon-based and are special elements that give specific metallurgical properties to products they are used in.

30% of the production is used to manufacture water supply, oil and gas pipelines
70% is used in applications where strength and formability are required (i.e., automotive components)

What are nodularisers?
The process of nodularisation aims to improve the mechanical properties of cast iron by ensuring the formation of graphite in the spheroidal or compacted form. These nodularisers are added in liquid cast iron to promote the formation of spheroidal graphite.
Nodularisers are ferrosilicon alloys containing magnesium with, when needed, rare-earth elements:

Magnesium is the principal element in FeSiMg alloys responsible for creating the necessary conditions for the graphite phase to grow from the liquid into the required spheroidal form.
Our range of FeSiMg alloys is designed to meet the requirements of most of the magnesium treatment processes currently used in the production of ductile iron.

What about those three main components of FeSiMg alloys?
Magnesium is the principal element in FeSiMg alloys responsible for creating the necessary conditions for the graphite phase to grow from the liquid into the required spheroidal form. The level of magnesium can be selected from a range between 5% to 10%. Several choice factors include treatment method used, degree of acceptable reactivity and economy of addition rate.
Calcium is an element which retards the rate of reaction of magnesium with the liquid iron and thereby improves magnesium recovery and reduces the reaction violence. In excessive amounts, calcium can produce slag.
Rare-earth elements (Ce, La...) are required in order to counteract the deleterious effect of certain trace elements on the iron graphite shape, notably Pb, Sb, and Bi. The decision of whether to use a nodulariser containing rare earth elements is generally determined by the quality and consistency of the raw materials used as melt stock. An additional important benefit is the improvement in nodule count and reduction in fading effect. Where high purity charge materials are used, the presence of rare earth elements in the treatment alloy can be unnecessary and even detrimental (causing "chunky graphite" forms).
What are inoculants?
Inoculants are added in liquid cast iron in order to provide the best and consistent characteristics in the final casting. They are used to control matrix structure and avoid casting defects. Inoculants can be found under several grain size distributions to satisfy the location of the inoculant addition within the foundry process. Those locations of inoculant addition are known as in furnace, in ladle, in stream or in mould.
Inoculants are ferrosilicon based alloys. Ferroglobe products differ from each other and the foundryman, assisted by one of our technical expert, will make a selection depending of the chosen application and the foundry process in question. All elements which are aluminium, barium, bismuth, calcium, carbon, strontium, zirconium or rare earth can be added in the exact amount into the base liquid iron in order to provoke and certify the final casting matrix structure.
The addition of inoculants in liquid cast iron (grey and ductile irons) allows us to:

Improve the homogeneity of the cast iron structure
Eliminate the formation of carbides into thin parts or salient angles
Direct the solidification towards the stable diagram, with graphite precipitation
Refine the structure (higher cells count, finer grains in the microstructure)
Improve mechanical properties
Better separate slag and metal
Decrease the tendency to dross formation
Decrease thetendency to micro-shrinkage
Decrease risk of gas formation
Decrease risk of mould/metal interface defects

What are cored-wire alloys?
Cored wire is a delivery method long preferred in the steel industry in which the alloy is grounded to a fine size, encapsulated in a sheath of steel, roll-formed into a tube and then wound into a coil. The steel sheath protects the alloy from oxidation and its fine size aids in the integration of the alloy into the molten metal
This cored wire technology, or cored wire injection process, is an ingenious way of adding metallurgical treatment chemical elements in the centre of a liquid iron bath. This process requires the use of an injection device placed vertically or horizontally near the metallurgical treatment site. This injection device will feed automatically, by taking into account the mass and the chemical composition of the treated liquid iron volume and the appropriated wire length needed to achieve the required metallurgical treatment.

Our Company 





Ferroglobe is one of the leading materials innovation companies in the world
Currently, after completing the combination of FerroAtlántica and Globe Specialty Metals and their subsidiaries, Ferroglobe is one of the largest producers of a wide variety of metal alloys and other metallic products. The company uses state-of-the-art-technology in all its processes to provide the best products, which are critical ingredients in many industrial and consumer products. This business approach allows the company to be at the forefront of silicon-based alloys production, but also provide manganese, ferrosilicon alloys and silica fume among others. 
Moreover, it is remarkable that beyond metal-related industries, Ferroglobe is also involved in hydro-electrical power generation and mining, both of which are related to its core activities and which produce synergies that benefit the company.
Global presence with a wide range of products and customers all around the world
The Company is organized into several Business Areas (Electrometallurgy / Mining / Energy / Solar Photovoltaic Technologies) divided into Operational Units located all around the world in: Spain, United States, France, Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Venezuela and China.
With this international infrastructure approach, Ferroglobe is able to deal with customers worldwide, providing excellent technical support thanks to highly trained professionals, and offering very fast deliveries. Some of Ferroglobe customers’ industries are: chemical silicon, aluminum and steel manufacturers, producers of photovoltaic solar cells and computer chips, the auto industry, ductile iron foundries, concrete and building material producers.
Our origins and future
On the one hand, FerroAtlántica group's history dates back to 1992, with the acquisition by Juan-Miguel Villar Mir of Ferroalloys Division of Carburos Metálicos Group, becoming FerroAtlántica on the 4th of December of that year. This company went on to acquire other businesses until Grupo FerroAtlántica was founded in 2007, integrating all the companies acquired up to that date in Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.
On the other hand, Globe was founded in December 2004 as International Metal Enterprises, Inc., an investment company established specifically to acquire operating companies in the metal industry. It raised USD $200 million in equity capital from a diverse group of financial institutions and listed shares on the London Stock Exchange AIM Market in October 2005. In November 2006, it acquired Globe Metallurgical, Inc. (GMI), the largest silicon metal manufacturer in North America and largest specialty ferroalloy manufacturer in the United States, with a corporate history dating back to 1871.
With time, both companies realised that they could embrace synergies through a merger, with many remarkable points such as:

Reduction in combined corporate overhead expenses
Ability to provide a more diversified suite of products to meet demand in growing-end markets
Energy division adds intrinsic hedge to potential power price inflation
Optimisation of product flows enables faster delivery times and improved customer service
Improved ability to serve international customers with combined global platform

The following illustration highlights all the most remarkable milestones for both companies.

Silicon metal





Being production leaders worldwide, we offer a wide range of high-purity chemical and metallurgical grade silicon metal products.  






This is possible as we are the largest producer of silicon metal in North America and among the largest producers in the world. This scale allows us to produce high-purity silicon metal in plants that have been certified among the most efficient in the world by CRU International (a metal industry research firm).
What is Silicon used for?
This high-purity silicon metal is used by many industries. In the chemical industry it is used for producing silicon compounds as well as silicon wafers used in photovoltaic solar cells and electronic semiconductors. And aluminum manufacturers use it to improve the already useful properties of aluminum. When used with aluminum, silicon improves its castability, hardness and strength.
Besides, aluminum demand has been growing steadily in recent years, as a reflection of the economic activity in both the developed and developing word. This demand of lighter and more economical material has triggered a growth in Silicon metal consumption by aluminum manufacturers.
That said, silicon compounds are the raw material for a large and growing number of industrial and consumer products such as:

Silicone rubber parts
Urethane foam
Sealants
Adhesives
Lubricants
Food additives
Coatings
Polishes and cosmetics

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
