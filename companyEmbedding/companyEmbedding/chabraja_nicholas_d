Nicholas D. Chabraja (pronounced cha-brah-ya) (born November 6, 1942 in Gary, Indiana[1]) is an American lawyer and former Chief Executive Officer[2] of General Dynamics Corporation.
Career[edit]
In 1967 he got a law degree from the Northwestern University.[1] He was then employed by the Jenner & Block law firm in which he stayed for almost thirty years, from 1968 to 1997. In this first and longest period of his career he also served as a Special Counsel for the United States House of Representatives. He also held counseling positions for General Dynamics, being a Senior Vice President and Counsel from 1993 to 1994, and a Vice Chairman from 1996 to 1997.[3]
In 1997 he was appointed a Chief Executive Officer of General Dynamics, a position which he held for twelve years, stepping down from his office in June 30, 2009. This makes Nicholas Chabraja the longest-serving Chief Executive Officer of the top five defense contractors, the others being Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Raytheon. Under his management General Dynamics grew rapidly, mainly through acquisitions: from $4 billion in sales and 29,000 employees, to $29.3 billion in sales and 92,900 employees in 2008.[4] In 2008, Nicholas D. Chabraja earned a total compensation of $17,962,579, which included a base salary of $1,375,000, a cash bonus of $4,500,000, stocks granted worth $3,756,556, options granted worth $7,926,420, and other compensation worth $404,603.[5] In 2009, he was included in the list of the 24 "TopGun CEOs" in the US, published by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[6][7]
He is also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity.

Employment Agreement - General Dynamics Corp. and Nicholas D. Chabraja









EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT FOR NICHOLAS D. CHABRAJA

         This Employment Agreement dated as of November 12, 1996, by and between
General Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (the 'Corporation') and Mr.
Nicholas D. Chabraja;

         WHEREAS, since January 1, 1993, Mr. Chabraja has served as Senior Vice
President and General Counsel of the Corporation, and since March 4, 1994, has
served as Executive Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation;

         WHEREAS, the Corporation desires to employ Mr. Chabraja, effective
January 1, 1997, as its Vice Chairman, and effective June 1, 1997, as its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and

         WHEREAS, Mr. Chabraja is willing to serve in such capacity with the
Corporation and to devote his full business time and attention to the business
and affairs of the Corporation and, in connection therewith, to withdraw as a
partner of the law firm of Jenner & Block, Chicago, Illinois, effective January
1, 1997;

         NOW THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed by and between the Corporation and
Mr. Chabraja as follows:

1.   Effective January 1, 1997, the Corporation hereby agrees to employ Mr.
     Chabraja, and Mr. Chabraja hereby agrees to accept such employment, as the
     Vice Chairman of the Corporation and to discharge such duties and
     responsibilities as are provided for in the Bylaws of the Corporation and
     as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Chairman and Chief
     Executive Officer of the Corporation. Furthermore, the Corporation hereby
     agrees to employ Mr. Chabraja effective June 1, 1997, and Mr. Chabraja
     hereby agrees to accept such employment, as the Chairman and Chief
     Executive Officer of the Corporation with such duties and responsibilities
     as are provided for in the Bylaws of the Corporation and as may be assigned
     to him from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

2.   Effective January 1, 1997, Mr. Chabraja shall be paid base compensation at
     the rate of $600,000 per year and effective June 1, 1997, Mr. Chabraja
     shall be paid base compensation at the rate of $700,000 per year.
     Thereafter, Mr. Chabraja shall receive increases in his base compensation
     as may from time to time be determined by the Compensation Committee of the
     Board of Directors of the Corporation provided that in no event during the
     term of this Employment Agreement shall Mr. Chabraja be paid base
     compensation at a rate of less than $700,000 per year.


In addition to base compensation, Mr. Chabraja shall be granted compensation
incentives and annual incentive compensation awards commensurate with the
Corporation's performance in comparison to strategic and operational plans and
the performance pay levels of other chief executive officers both on a national 
basis and in the defense industry. In addition, Mr. Chabraja shall be eligible
for all other benefits and perquisites offered to other salaried officers of
the Corporation who are employed at the Corporate Headquarters, including
retirement plan benefits, SSIP benefits, group insurance coverage and other
benefits provided to such senior executive officers. In addition, Mr. Chabraja
shall be entitled to the use of corporate aircraft, consistent in all cases
with Board resolutions and the Corporation's policies regarding the use of such
aircraft.

3.   Effective January 1, 1997, Mr. Chabraja will withdraw as a partner of the
     law firm of Jenner & Block, but shall remain 'of counsel' to such firm for
     the period from January 1, 1997, to May 31, 1997, in order to enable him to
     effectively transition his client practice to other individuals in the
     firm. On June 1, 1997, Mr. Chabraja shall terminate the 'of counsel'
     relationship to such firm and after said date and during his employment by
     the Corporation shall have no employment relationship with Jenner & Block.

4.   Effective January 1, 1997, Mr. Chabraja will move his residence to the
     Washington, D. C., metropolitan area. In that regard, the Corporation
     hereby agrees to pay to Mr. Chabraja a one-time housing allowance of up to
     $250,000, 'grossed-up' for all federal, state and local taxes payable in
     connection with that payment, in order to defray the cost and expenses of
     such move, provided Mr. Chabraja shall provide to the Corporation written
     evidence or other satisfactory substantiation of the expenditure of such
     amounts.

5.   In recognition of Mr. Chabraja's separation from Jenner & Block and
     employment as Vice Chairman and thereafter Chairman and Chief Executive
     Officer of the Corporation, the Corporation hereby agrees to provide to Mr.
     Chabraja with the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Agreement of even date
     herewith, attached as an Addendum to this Employment Agreement which will
     provide to him an annual retirement benefit of $280,000, if Mr. Chabraja
     voluntarily terminates his employment during the first three years of this
     Agreement, increasing by $6,296 per full month of service with the
     Corporation that Mr. Chabraja completes during the period from January 1,
     2000, to December 31, 2002. In the event Mr. Chabraja's employment with the
     Corporation is terminated prior to December 31, 2002, by the Corporation
     other than 'for cause,' as defined in Paragraph 6 hereto, then for purposes
     of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Agreement, Mr. Chabraja will be
     deemed to have completed his employment on December 31, 2002. Payment of
     retirement benefits to Mr. Chabraja may not commence prior to January 1,
     2003.

6.   This Employment Agreement shall be effective on the date hereof and shall
     terminate on December 31, 2002. In the event this Employment Agreement is
     terminated by the Corporation prior to December 31, 2002, other than 'for
     cause,' the Corporation shall pay to Mr. Chabraja at the time of such
     termination the amounts Mr. Chabraja would have been entitled to for the
     full term hereof, based on his base compensation on the date of such
     termination. If this Employment Agreement is terminated prior to December
     31, 2002, by Mr. Chabraja, or is terminated by the Corporation 'for cause,'
     the Corporation shall pay Mr. Chabraja, at the time of such termination,
     all amounts due hereunder through the date of such termination. Termination
     of this Employment Agreement prior to December 31, 2002, shall in no event
     affect Mr. Chabraja's rights under Section 5 hereof.

For purposes of this Section 6, termination 'for cause' shall mean action by Mr.
Chabraja: (i) an act or acts of personal dishonesty, (ii) conviction of a felony





     related to the Corporation, (iii) material violation of General Dynamics'  
     standards of business ethics and conduct, or (iv) individually filing or
     participating in a lawsuit against the Corporation.

     Upon any termination of Mr. Chabraja's employment by the Corporation, in
     addition to any and all other sums Mr. Chabraja may then be entitled, the
     Corporation hereby agrees that he shall also be entitled to a directed
     buy-out of the residence being acquired by him contemporaneously with the  
     execution of this Employment Agreement, which is located in McLean,
     Virginia, in an amount which is equal to the greater of (a) the then
     appraised value of said residence, (b) the original cost to Mr. Chabraja
     of such property, plus all improvements made by him thereto, as defined in
     the Corporation's Relocation Policy.

7.   Mr. Chabraja is currently a party to a Severance Protection Agreement with
     the Corporation dated January 18, 1996, which provides certain benefits to
     Mr. Chabraja in the event of a termination of Mr. Chabraja's employment
     with the Corporation. The parties agree that in the event of a termination
     of Mr. Chabraja's employment with the Corporation, such that he has rights
     under this Employment Agreement and the Severance Protection Agreement, or
     any extension or modification thereof, Mr. Chabraja shall be entitled to
     receive the benefits under the provisions of Sections 2.1(b)(i) and (ii) of
     the Severance Protection Agreement or the First Paragraph of Section 6 of
     his Employment Agreement, whichever is greater. In addition, as to those
     benefits provided for in both the Severance Protection Agreement, or any
     extension or modification thereof, and this Employment Agreement, Mr.
     Chabraja will be entitled to those benefits which are the more favorable to
     him. Except as provided for in this Section 7, the Severance Protection
     Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

8.   This Employment Agreement shall ensure to the benefit of and be binding
     upon the Corporation and successors and assigns and upon Mr. Chabraja and
     his heirs, executors, and assigns and shall be construed and enforced in
     accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.








         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation and Mr. Chabraja have executed this
Employment Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

                         RETIREMENT BENEFIT AGREEMENT

ADDENDUM TO AGREEMENT dated as of 12 November 1996 between General Dynamics
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the `'Corporation'), and Nicholas D.
Chabraja (the 'Employee').

WHEREAS, the Employee has accrued retirement benefits which will be payable to
him from the General Dynamics Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (the
'Retirement Plan') and to the extent the accrued benefits under the Retirement
Plan are limited by Section 415, 401 (a)(4) or 401 (a)(17) of the Internal
Revenue Code (or similar provision), any benefit that would have been provided
by the benefit formula of the Retirement Plan in excess of those limitations
will be provided under a nonqualified plan (Supplemental Retirement Plan). The
Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the Retirement Program.'

WHEREAS, this Agreement provides for retirement benefits to be paid on the
Employee's retirement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the Employee's past employment by the
Corporation and the Employee's future services, the Corporation and the Employee
agree as follows:

 1.      MEMBERSHIP IN GENERAL DYNAMICS RETIREMENT PLAN. The

Employee will continue to be a member of the General Dynamics Retirement
Program, a copy of which has been furnished to him.

 2.      RETIREMENT BENEFIT. Upon the Employee's retirement from the

Corporation, the Employee shall be entitled to such annual retirement benefits,
if any, as of the date of the Employee's termination of employment with the
Corporation, based upon the terms of the Retirement Program. Payment of these
benefits shall commence at such time and in the form the Employee elects
pursuant to the terms of the Retirement Plan.

 3.      SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT.

(a)  Upon the termination of the Employee's employment with the Corporation,
         but no earlier than 1 January 2003, the Employee shall also be paid by
         the Corporation each year, as an additional annual retirement benefit
         for his life, an amount (the 'Supplement'), if any, by which the
         Estimated Retirement Plan Benefit for his life (as described in
         Paragraph (c)) exceeds the annual retirement benefit for his life that
         he is entitled to be paid pursuant to the Retirement Program.










(b)  The benefit provided by Paragraph (a) of this section will not be provided 
         to the Employee if the Employee causes harm to the Corporation
         (financial, reputation, or product), through: (i) an act or acts of
         personal dishonesty, (ii) conviction of a felony related to the
         Corporation, (iii) material violation of General Dynamics' standards of
         business ethics and conduct, (iv) individually filing or participating
         in a lawsuit against the Corporation, or (v) subsequent employment with
         a competitor without Compensation Committee approval.

(c)  The Estimated Retirement Benefit shall equal an annual retirement benefit 
         of $280,000 for the first three years of the Employment Agreement and 
         shall increase $6,296 per full month of service with the Corporation 
         that Mr. Chabraja completes during the period of 1 January 2000 to 31 
         December 2002.

 4.      ALTERNATE FORM OF BENEFIT. The Employee shall have the option,

on written notice transmitted to the Corporation at least 30 days prior to the
date on which payment of his benefit would otherwise commence hereunder, to
elect to receive the retirement benefit described herein payable in an alternate
form as provided by the Retirement Plan or, in the Corporation's discretion, in
another form of actuarial equivalent value. The applicable single-life annual
benefit shall then be converted to the alternate form elected by the application
of the actuarial factors used for converting benefits under the Retirement Plan
at the time the retirement benefit is to commence.

 5.      SURVIVOR BENEFIT IN CASE OF DEATH PRIOR TO

COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFITS. If the Employee dies prior to commencement of
benefits, his spouse shall be entitled to receive payment of the Supplement (as
calculated in Paragraph 3(a)) as a pre-retirement surviving spouse annuity as
defined in the Retirement Plan (currently defined at a 50% Contingent Annuity)

Nicholas and Eleanor Chabraja donate $5.6 million to Northwestern


Chicago-area businessman Nicholas Chabraja and his wife, Eleanor, have donated $5.6 million to Northwestern University in part to support the study of history and political science.“Eleanor and I really believe in the mission of the Center for Historical Studies,” Chabraja, former chairman and CEO of General Dynamics Corp., who received undergraduate and law degrees from Northwestern, said in a statement. He said he hopes the gift will help in recruiting and retaining "exemplary students pursuing advanced graduate work."A call to the couple's home in Lake Forest wasn't immediately returned.The gift is part of Northwestern's “We Will” fundraising campaign and will support the Nicholas D. Chabraja Center for Historical Studies in the Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. It also will support the annual funds of the Weinberg College and the School of Law, the athletics department and its Wildcat Fund, the Women's Board (Eleanor has been a member since 2003) and the Renee and Lester Crown Speaker Series.LESTER CROWN TIEThat last recipient is of particular importance to the Chabrajas, as Chicago financier Lester Crown was a critical financial backer of General Dynamics back in the 1960s, enabling the company to evolve into a heavyweight in the defense industry.Nicholas Chabraja remains a director of the company and also is on the board of Northern Trust. He's the non-executive chairman of Tower International and a member of Northwestern's board of trustees. Before General Dynamics, he was a litigation partner at Jenner & Block.His wife is on the board of the Naples Botanical Garden and previously was a board member at the Bexley Seabury Federation, a theological school.Daniel Linzer, Northwestern's provost, said in the statement, “History is one of the top-ranked and most popular departments in Weinberg, and we are committed to building a continuous pipeline of promising scholars throughout the university who take historical approaches in their work."Sara Maza, director of the Chabraja Center, said in the statement, “The Chabraja family's generosity has sustained us from the start." The latest gift “will enable us to expand our programming.”Northwestern President Morton Schapiro hosted a celebration last night for the Chabrajas to mark the fifth anniversary of the Chabraja Center, which was named for Nicholas Chabraja in 2010.

Nicholas D. Chabraja (pronounced cha-brah-ya) (born November 6, 1942 in Gary, Indiana[1]) is an American lawyer and former Chief Executive Officer[2] of General Dynamics Corporation.
Career
In 1967 he got a law degree from the Northwestern University.[1] He was then employed by the Jenner & Block law firm in which he stayed for almost thirty years, from 1968 to 1997. In this first and longest period of his career he also served as a Special Counsel for the United States House of Representatives. He also held counseling positions for General Dynamics, being a Senior Vice President and Counsel from 1993 to 1994, and a Vice Chairman from 1996 to 1997.[3]
In 1997 he was appointed a Chief Executive Officer of General Dynamics, a position which he held for twelve years, stepping down from his office in June 30, 2009. This makes Nicholas Chabraja the longest-serving Chief Executive Officer of the top five defense contractors, the others being Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Raytheon. Under his management General Dynamics grew rapidly, mainly through acquisitions: from $4 billion in sales and 29,000 employees, to $29.3 billion in sales and 92,900 employees in 2008.[4] In 2008, Nicholas D. Chabraja earned a total compensation of $17,962,579, which included a base salary of $1,375,000, a cash bonus of $4,500,000, stocks granted worth $3,756,556, options granted worth $7,926,420, and other compensation worth $404,603.[5] In 2009, he was included in the list of the 24 "TopGun CEOs" in the US, published by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[6][7]
He is also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity.
