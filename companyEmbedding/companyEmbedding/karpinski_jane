Who We Are




Vision Development is a family run business, which comprises Jane and Tim Karpinski along with their daughter Lucy.  Jane and Tim have been working together in the construction (based in the Reading and Newbury area) industry since 1979 managing a variety of successful ventures including erecting large numbers of timber frame buildings, helping self builders and property developers.  In 1999 they won Self Building Magazine’s ‘Company of the Year’ award.
In 2011 the family formed Vision Development to supply and erect timber frame solutions.  Because of the success and growth of Vision Development they decided that, instead of buying timber frame solutions from other suppliers, they would manufacture them their selves so they could better address clients individual needs and cost effectively produce a top quality product. 
Vision Development’s capabilities include…

An in-house design facility
Our own manufacturing facility
Installation teams

Put simply we can provide you with a timber frame solution for your new home or extension which can be either…

Manufactured and erected (if required) to meet a design and specifications provided by you
Based upon one of our standard timber frame house kits (modified to your requirements if desired)
Custom designed by us to meet your requirements

 Our service spans from manufacturing and installing the timber frame to providing a complete design and build service and covers all points in between.  Supported by our partners, we can provide a range of additional products and services to complement and support our timber frame solutions, depending upon your location.  These include…

Help with planning applications and related matters
Energy and environmental surveys and calculations
