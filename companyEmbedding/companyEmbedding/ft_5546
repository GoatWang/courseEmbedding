A maximum of four additional sets may be added to your five set package, at the time you place your order.  Between planning and building departments, lending institutions, and neighborhood architectural review boards, extra sets may be necessary to provide enough sets for bids and construction.





Full Reverse Sets
$100



Reverse sets are mirror images of the design.  With "Full Reverse" plans, though the layout is mirrored, all of the text and dimensions have been adjusted to read normally --- not mirror image.  Customers have a strong preference for "right reading" plans, as many services simply print their plans from the back side, leaving text difficult to read, and leading to costly construction errors.

            Wickford Description - 5546
          

Shades of the International style movement are evident in this spectacular contemporary home. Its hillside-friendly nature, multiple balconies and foundation stonework make it the perfect choice for the discriminating homeowner. Begin your tour of the home by entering through an attractive sidelit entry door to the foyer with nine-foot ceiling. On the left is a dining hall for formal occasions; on the right is a two-story living room with through-fireplace to the den. A wide deck opens from the living room and stretches to the den to overlook the front of the property. More casual living is to the back of the plan: a family room/nook combination and an amply appointed island kitchen. A full bath at the back of the plan (near a laundry room) allows the den to serve as a guest room if needed. The master suite is on the upper level as are two family bedrooms. Each bedroom has its own walk-in closet. The master suite features a bath with walk-in shower, spa tub, compartmented toilet and dual sinks. The garage lies on the lower level and contains more than enough space for a well-equipped workshop.

Welcome to Innerarity Island "A Gated Community". This vacant wooded lot is ready for you to purchase and build your Dream Home. Located a Perdido Key and minutes to Grand Lagoon State Park, Galvez Boat Launch at Hub Stacy's, Minutes to the Gulf by car with white sandy beaches at The Gulf Island National Seashore. Beautiful Community to live in with deeded access to picnic area and dock for fishing. There are beautiful homes located in this quaint community in Perdido Key, Florida. If you are ready to build your Dream Home now is the time to purchase your lot and start building. There are many custom home builders in Pensacola that will build your Dream Home. This lot has green-ways on all sides of the lot except in the front. Explanation of green-ways: A second generation of trail-oriented recreational green-ways emerged in the 1970's along rivers, streams and abandoned rail lines. A third generation emerged in the 1980's, multi-objective green-ways that become infrastructure for wildlife, flood hazard reduction, water quality protection and utility ways. An emerging forth generation of green-ways will express itself as regional, inter-city and inter-open space networks. Water and Sewer is available but the tap fee has not been paid. Underground Utilities. This lot is wooded with ample room to build a great home. There is a park with a pier for fishing in the community. Covenants and Restrictions. Call me today and let's get started. The lot next door is for sale as well. So you could buy both lots and have over 1/2 acre.

                    Saturday  - Must Do!  Palafox Market 
Find hidden gems among close to 50 vendors.  You can buy anything from  an avocado plant to a rum cake, to a tye-dyed shirt, to lovely hand-made jewelry.  After the Market, you can stop by the Pensacola Bay Brewery for a cold beer on a hot day.  Make sure that you also stop by Plaza de Luna to view the scenery and all the beautiful boats in the marina.

                    Pensacola is a great place to live! The weather is conducive to year-round outdoor activities, and the cost of living is affordable at 86.6/100 according to Sperling's Best Places. If the beach is your thing, the white sand beaches and emerald waters are pretty spectacular. Pensacola Naval Air Station is home to the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, and watching them train above our heads never fails to inspire awe. The Saturday downtown Farmers' Market is a great place to buy local produce or meet local artists.  And you will see lots of happy pooches stepping out with their special humans about town. One of the nicest things, though, is the people of Pensacola.  There are some genuinely nice folks here.  Thirty years after training in the area as a young soldier, I chose Pensacola to be my home base.

Is it North Port or North Port Charlotte?

                    The History of North Port  from North Port County Government

Incorporated in 1959, the City of North Port, Florida occupies 103 square miles of southeast Sarasota County midway between the cities of Sarasota and Fort Myers, near the Gulf of Mexico. North Port is one of the largest Florida cities in land area but is only 10 percent populated. The City began with a population of 178 and was originally known as North Port Charlotte. The name was later shortened to North Port, which helped to create an individual city identity. Since 1980, North Port's population has grown 120%, making it one of the fastest growing cities in Florida. According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, as of 2007 the city's population was 53,732. 

Why is North Port, Florida attracting families and business from all over at such an accelerated pace? Its beauty, convenience, economic development, job opportunities, some of the lowest property taxes in the southwest Florida region and a top notch public education infrastructure including a state of the art high school and middle school as well as a community college less than 5 miles away and 3 four-year institutions within a 60-mile radius. 

North Port has an unspoiled natural environment where wildlife flourishes among 95 miles of freshwater canals. It is also the only city in Florida that contains a state forest (Myakka State Forest) within its corporate boundaries. North Port offers a multitude of recreational opportunities such as golfing, fishing, horseback riding, canoeing and more. North Port encompasses fourteen miles of Interstate I-75 within its boundaries. It has two international airports within 45 minutes making, the City accessible to most major markets. Although, North Port is inland, its weather is influenced by the Gulf of Mexico. The average annual temperature of 76 degrees makes year-round living a pleasure, and the City is host to many seasonal residents as well.
