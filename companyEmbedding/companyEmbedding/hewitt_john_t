John Hewitt - CEO of Liberty Tax Service

Bio: After managing more than 2,000 preparers in 250 offices
  for H&R Block, John Hewitt identified that the future of tax
  preparation needed a technological innovation.  So in 1982,
  Hewitt founded Jackson Hewitt and, in 1986, started franchise
  operations. Hewitt's business plan was to utilize the
  revolutionary "Hewtax" computerized tax interview software that
  he and his father created, and also outperform the competition
  with superlative customer service. By 1996 Jackson Hewitt was the
  second largest tax preparation company and sold for $483
  million.
By then, Hewitt was ready for a new business venture. But
  after brainstorming with some of his trusted colleagues, they
  decided that they knew and loved one thing: taxes. And they knew
  they could do it better by starting over. So the same year
  Jackson Hewitt sold, John Hewitt purchased 126 U&R Tax
  offices in Canada. Just two years later, he had established
  thirty offices in seven markets in the U.S. (and nearly 250
  offices including Canada). Today, with more than 4,100 offices
  across the continent, Liberty Tax Service is the fastest growing
  tax preparation company EVER.
Hewitt has successfully navigated 43 career tax seasons,
  making him the most experienced CEO in the industry. He is a
  philanthropist, an avid chess and bridge player, further
  exemplifying his strategic impulses and need for competition. For
  twelve consecutive years, he has been named one of the "Top 100
  Most Influential People in the Tax Industry" by Accounting Today
  and was also named "Entrepreneur of the Year" by both the
  International Franchise Association and Ernst and Young.

Tell us about the Liberty Tax Service concept.
The concept of providing excellent customer service and
    keeping the customer happy so that they become a repeat
    customer isn't new, but so few companies act on it. They talk a
    good game but they don't do the research and the follow up. It
    requires changing the status quo. That's where Liberty Tax is
    different. We deliver. For example, if you come into our
    offices and have to wait more than 15 minutes, we pay you. We
    truly do put the customer first. Our dedication to unparalleled
    customer service and delivering the WOW factor is what we call
    the "Liberty Edge".  We deliver the little unexpected
    extras that make people take notice and feel appreciated.
How and when did you decide on Liberty Tax Service?
It really did start on a napkin. Some of my most trusted
    colleagues and I sat down and wrote on the back of a napkin, 13
    things we would do differently from what we had done in the
    past to create an environment of success. We wanted to take on
    the 800lb gorilla in H&R Block and the company that bore my
    name, Jackson Hewitt. People thought we were crazy - insane!
    But we vowed to implement some of those 13 ideas. We acted on
    what we knew was the right way to do business. And we
    succeeded.
What was your background prior to Liberty Tax Service?
When I was 19 years old, I started a job as a tax preparer
    and it was the most interesting job I had ever had. I enjoyed
    the work immensely and it showed. I quickly climbed the ranks,
    becoming a District Manager, and then the youngest Regional
    Director in H&R Block history at the time. Of course, I
    then went on to found Jackson Hewitt.
What are some of the advantages in being a Liberty Tax
    franchise?
We believe in creating happy, successful franchisees. They
    are at the core of developing our operating system. Our unique
    marketing approach helps each franchise get immediate
    recognition in communities everywhere. Whether it's with
    "Wavers" in the Statue of Liberty costumes or roadside parties
    serving hot dogs, we draw attention to our Liberty Tax
    locations.  We deeply believe in the grass roots of our
    communities.
Who is your ideal franchisee?
Liberty franchisees are all different. They're retirees,
    CPAs, full-time Moms, bankers and insurance pros. For all their
    differences, they do share a few common beliefs - they embrace
    the challenge of being self-employed and believe in following a
    proven system that will led them to succeed.
Tell us a little about the tax market?
Of the 132 million tax returns filed by Americans each year,
    62% of those pay someone to prepare and file their tax return
    for them. In this economy, some mom and pop tax service shops
    are closing their doors. So there is a lot of consolidation
    happening. For those not wanting a new boss, a Liberty Tax
    Franchise allows them to be their own boss; we just provide the
    experience and proven track record.
Remember the two certainties in life? Death and taxes. Well,
    we must also embrace the third certainty - change. While other
    companies flounder to understand market changes, at Liberty
    Tax, we respond and move forward.
What are some of the greatest lessons you've learned in
    growing this franchise?
That I'm still learning.
In starting a business, you need to really test your
    concepts and ideas. Test, test, and retest. Be willing to go
    back to the drawing board. Also treat your employees as if they
    are your best paying customer because in reality they are the
    day-to-day representatives of your company. And probably the
    most important lesson I learned, when you put your heart and
    soul into a company, always have a controlling interest.
Do you have a mentor and is there someone you use for
    inspiration?
My father was a great mentor, he advised me on when to get
    in and when to get out of a career situation. We were both
    visionaries. He showed me the vision of computerized tax
    preparation and when we couldn't convince H&R Block to buy
    our program, he convinced me to start my own retail tax
    company. He was a great supporter and motivator.
What advice do you have for someone looking to acquire a
    franchise?
The passion has to be there. You have to be committed to
    your success. Follow the system that the franchisor has put in
    place, and follow the advice they give. Be prepared to trust
    the experts. They want you to succeed as much as you do. It's
    like a marriage; both sides need to be happy.
In your opinion, why do you think that Liberty Tax would be
    a great opportunity for someone?
One great aspect about Liberty Tax is you work hard for
    three and a half months then can reward yourself with some
    personal enrichment time and valuable time with family.
It provides a great quality of life. A seasonal business
    also affords you the time to prepare and train for the next
    season. And speaking of training, we provide regular and
    ongoing webinars and programs. We have everything you need for
    startup - the proprietary software, support and insight 52
    weeks a year and a proven marketing plan that sets Liberty Tax
    apart from the crowd.

Liberty CEO Talks Lawsuits & Franchising







Posted Tue, 2010-10-26 13:23 by BMM 



	VIRGINIA BEACH — CEO John T. Hewitt weighs in on how his franchising firm, Liberty Tax Service, is coping with the challenges of a lack of business loans for franchise owner-operators, the state of California suing the tax preparer and the federal government clamping down on tax refund loans.

	Hewitt’s 41 years in the tax preparation industry, starting at H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), leaves him arguably its most seasoned leader. After his former employer turned down Hewitt’s vision of using software to prepare taxes, he branched out on his own in 1982. His company became Jackson Hewitt Tax Services (NYSE:JTX), a leader in electronic tax filings. The co-founder left the chain when Cendant Corporation, a conglomerate of hotel, real estate and car rental franchisors, bought it for $483 million.

	John Hewitt founded Liberty Tax Services in 1997. According to WorldFranchising.com, the online publication of franchise researcher Source Book Publications, Liberty Tax Services has 3,468 franchise units and 77 company-owned units.

	It is a tough environment for tax preparers on many fronts. On October 12, 2010, Meta Financial filed a report announcing that the Office of Thrift Supervision had determined that MetaBank had engaged in alleged deceptive practices, which were in violation of federal trade law. On October 18 the company announced that subsidiary MetaBank had been blocked from entering into contracts for refund loans.

	That federal action is causing repercussions. On October 18 H&R Block, a tax preparation franchising firm that has over 4,000 franchised offices, sued HSBC Bank, saying that the bank was no longer backing up H&R Block’s tax-refund loans, but that its contract obliged it to do so.

	Hewitt responds, “This new development adds a level of complication for many small tax preparation offices, as MetaBank is one of the few financial institutions still participating in refund loan product disbursements. Seemingly this directive might very well not allow MetaBank to continue offering products for tax-related programs. Many tax preparers will be left without any option to provide an accelerated refund loan.”

BMM: While on the topic of regulators and lawsuits, in 2009 Liberty Tax Service lost a deceptive ad suit to California’s Attorney General. Regarding the $1.2 million win, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said, “Liberty Tax Service lured cash-strapped Californians into paying for high-cost loans, when they could obtain tax refunds free from the IRS just weeks later.” He explained that Liberty Tax Service's print and television ads misled customers by promising "Most Refunds in 24 Hours." 

"This ruling bars Liberty from deceptive advertising that blurs the line between IRS tax refunds and pricey loans," said Brown.

Pretty strong words. What happened?

Hewitt: About six years ago California went after Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block and Liberty, saying that we violated some obscure law. In our case they did not have a customer complaint. What happened is that they first settled with Jackson Hewitt. Jackson Hewitt paid them close to $4.5 million. Jackson Hewitt had been doing business in California since 1989. Liberty did not enter the California market until 2000. We are a lot smaller. So we said that we would settle. If Jackson Hewitt did X amount of products, and you penalized them for $4.5 million, we did 5 percent as many products that the complaint is about so we will settle for 5 percent of $4.5 million.

	They said, “No, no, no, no. These are fines. You have to pay $2.5 million, or $3 million."

	We said, “Wait a minute. We are only 5 percent as big.”

	California sued all of us. As we were preparing for trial, H&R Block settled. It only paid $5 million. We said if H&R Block paid $5 million, we only handled 1 percent of the returns that Block did, so we are only guilty of 1 percent. We should only pay $50,000. But we will put a $250,000 offer on the table.

	They would not take it. And we would not settle.

	We took it to trial, and lost. I think the total judgment added up to $1.8 million.

	Right now the lawsuit is at the Court of Appeals.

BMM: According to WorldFranchising, the state with the largest number of Liberty Tax franchises is California, with over 350 offices. Is this lawsuit affecting franchisees?

Hewitt: No, not at all. California did not sue the franchisees.



		Data: Franchise Times, WorldFranchising


	The International Franchise Association signed an amicus brief in the appeals court because they [California's attorney general office] said we [the franchisor] were vicariously liable for the actions of our franchisees, even though what happened was that some of our franchisees in Los Angeles ran some ads that were not approved.

	In the franchise agreement, it says that you cannot run ads that aren’t approved. Yet the franchisee violated that and ran ads in this little, teeny Penny Saver in northern Los Angeles in violation of Internal Revenue Service statutes. The franchisee ran them for two to three weeks without our permission. As soon as we saw them, we shut them down and stopped them from running the ads. The state held that not only did the franchisee break the law, but that we [the franchisor] were also responsible for breaking that law.

	That is unprecedented. I don’t think there is any other court case or major court case where a franchisor is found guilty for a franchisee breaking the law.

	California is a tough place to do business.

	There was another thing that was very unusual with two of our products, loans and tax refunds. It works like this: A customer comes in and you say, “Sir, you have a $3,000 refund. Your fee to me is $200. If you pay this fee, then you get $3,000 in ten days. Or, if you don’t want to pay the $200, you can pay an additional $29 fee and we will withhold it from your refund. So instead of getting $3,000, you don’t pay me anything today, but you’ll get $3,000 less $200, less the $29 fee, in two weeks."

	We are the only ones liable for this. Jackson Hewitt and Block, because they settled, aren’t subject to this. They [California] said the $29 is a loan, and subject to interest and all kinds of stuff.

	Liberty has to give different disclosures to our customers than H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt. We said that we would settle for the same language as Block and Jackson Hewitt use. The court said “No, no.” So it is all at the appellate court now.

BMM: How tough is it right now to sell franchises?

Hewitt: It is a tough time.

	In previous recessions when I have been a franchisor, franchise sales actually increased. As white-collar executives were laid off, they wanted to control their own destiny. They said they didn’t want to be put in the position again where they could be laid off. Many of them would take severance money and move into a franchise.

	In this recession more people than ever are just frightened to death. That was especially the case back in 2008, when many potential buyers felt that the economy was going into a depression. Nowadays, even if they want a franchise, such as our franchise, which can be bought for a low investment of $70,000 that includes everything, people just do not have $70,000 in their checking account. They typically have cash tied up in their home, but they have not been able to draw equity out of their home for the last two years.

	Or they have money in a 401k [retirement plan]. In 2008, the 401k plans became 200 1/2k’s. What I mean is that retirement funds lost 50 percent of their value. People just do not have discretionary money today, so a lot fewer people have money to take the leap to become self-employed. When you are self-employed, it is going to take you two, three or four years before being able to draw major cash out of the business.

	It is a tough time to start a business, so franchise systems are down across the board in bringing in new franchisees.

BMM: How are you dealing with the shortage of franchise buyers?

Hewitt: On Wall Street they call me a serial entrepreneur. That is because this is the third company I have been successful with in making investors a lot of money. It is a lot easier for me to tap into money than for a lot of people. For example, Liberty Tax Services has a $100 million line of credit. And our line of credit is so good that it is only a little over LIBOR [London Interbank Offered Rate]. It is about 1.5 percent. It is not even a yearly line of credit but a five-year line of credit. And we still have three years left.

	Liberty pays it back every year. At the end of the year we have no debt.

	Liberty uses most of that money. Not for us, but to lend to franchisees to expand. We have lent franchisees $60 million over the last ten years to grow their businesses. So we go out and get the money. What we had to do over the last three years was finance more of that $70,000 in initial investment. We have never done that before.

	On average, instead of people putting in the entire $70,000, we are now lending them a third of that to help transition into our franchise system. We have stepped up our lending to first-year franchisees. Normally in years past before the recession, we lent money to second-, third-year or older franchisees. But now we have to lend in order to pull new people into the business.

The second part of this interview with John Hewitt will be published shortly. In it Mr. Hewitt discusses his attempt to acquire H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt. He also provides insights into independent franchisee associations.
