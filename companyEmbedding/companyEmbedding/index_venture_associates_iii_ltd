Outgoings

Business Rates/Property Tax
                        No properties were found where INDEX VENTURE GROWTH ASSOCIATES III (IGP), L.P. is liable for the business rates / property tax. This could be for a number of reasons. The council hasnt published the data We havent found or been able to process the councils data The company is part of a group of companies and another company in the group is liable for business rates The registered office may be a residential address which does not have a commercial designation. If the business is run from home then it won't be a commercial property and hence won't be liable for business rates. Serviced offices are increasingly popular and therefore a business may not be paying business rates directly - the building owner is and this is incorporated in the office rental charge.

Who we are

Uniquely passionate entrepreneurs.
We back the best and most ambitious entrepreneurs and help them make their ideas real and lasting. The entrepreneurs we team up with were born to build their businesses -- it is their life’s mission. Working side-by-side with these visionaries makes us incredibly optimistic about the future. The transformative companies they’re building, include: Adyen, Dropbox, Etsy, Sonos, SoundCloud, King, BlaBlaCar, Squarespace, Just Eat, Lookout, Hortonworks, Pure Storage, Supercell, Criteo, Funding Circle and many others.
Full attention of our partnership.
To us, providing full-service means giving you the full attention of our partnership. We structurally de-emphasize individual partner achievements to provide you with the full partnerships’ collective experience and expertise. Access to one means access to all. As our founding partner, Gerald Rimer, likes to say, “We’re not a family business, we’re a business family.”
Global ambitions.
We believe that passionate entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. We’ve supported consumer and enterprise technology entrepreneurs in 39 cities around the world and have helped them as they grow into new regions. Our physical presence in San Francisco, London and Geneva serve as places where our entrepreneurs can come together, and as jumping off points to discover what’s next.
 






Our history

Founded in Geneva in 1996 by Neil Rimer, Giuseppe Zocco, David Rimer.
Principal offices: London and San Francisco.
Most recent funds: early-stage fund (Index Ventures 8) & growth fund (Index Growth 3).
