CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.



    Description
of Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is
engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on
November 16, 2005. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began July 11, 2006 as a part of an
offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 06-07
Drilling Program, (the “Program”), and concluded
September 1, 2006, with total investor contributions of
$50,000,000 originally being sold to 1,576 subscribers of which
$43,174,000 were sold to 1,342 subscribers as general partner
interests and $6,826,000 were sold to 234 subscribers as limited
partner interests. During, 2008, all general partner equity
interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the
Partnership.

 




2.



    Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2010, which contains a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing
the quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

 




3.



    
Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains
and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of
future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties. There was no cost ceiling
write-down for the three or six months ended June 30, 2011 or
2010.

Asset Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests or well plugging and abandonment costs, or if federal or
state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 is as
follows:

Related Party Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

Pursuant to the
Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20% of total
capital costs. To the extent that organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs are less than 20% of total capital
costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its
share of the Program’s total capital costs reaches
approximately 20%. The Partnership’s financial statements
reflect its respective proportionate interest in the
Program.




   Item 2.
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Mewbourne
Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the “Partnership”) was
formed November 16, 2005. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began July 11, 2006 and concluded
September 1, 2006, with total investor contributions of
$50,000,000. During 2008, all general partner equity interests were
converted to limited partner equity interests.

Future capital
requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds
generated from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is
anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital of $840,129 at
June 30, 2011.

During the six
months ended June 30, 2011, the Partnership made cash
distributions to the investor partners in the amount of $1,704,799
as compared to $2,656,378 for the six months ended June 30,
2010. The Partnership expects that cash distributions will continue
during 2011 as additional oil and gas revenues are sufficient to
produce cash flows from operations.

The sale of
crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be
affected by a number of factors that are beyond the
Partnership’s control. These factors include the price of
crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for
these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production
and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive
conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
future effect of these factors on the Partnership.

  NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)




 



1.



Description
of Business




 

Mewbourne
Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is
engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on November 16,
2005. The offering of limited and general partnership interests
began July 11, 2006 as a part of an offering registered under the
name Mewbourne Energy Partners 06-07 Drilling Program, (the
“Program”), and concluded September 1, 2006, with total
investor contributions of $50,000,000 originally being sold to
1,576 subscribers of which $43,174,000 were sold to 1,342
subscribers as general partner interests and $6,826,000 were sold
to 234 subscribers as limited partner interests. During, 2008, all
general partner equity interests were converted to limited partner
equity interests. In accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, Mewbourne Development Corporation (“MD”), a
Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Partnership’s
managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in
the Partnership.

 




 



2.



Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies




 

Reference
is hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2015, which contains a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing
the quarterly report included herein.

 

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year. In preparing these financial statements, the Partnership
has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and
disclosure through the date the financial statements were
issued.

 




 



3.



Accounting
for Oil and Gas Producing Activities




 

The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains
and losses are not recognized unless such adjustments would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a
quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of
the present value of estimated future net cash flows of proved
reserves, computed using the 12-month unweighted average of
first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices, discounted at
10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. If
unamortized costs capitalized exceed the ceiling, the excess is
charged to expense in the period the excess occurs. There were cost
ceiling write-downs totaling $1,108,687 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. There were no cost ceiling write-downs for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015.

4.



Asset
Retirement Obligations




 

The
Partnership has recognized an estimated asset retirement obligation
liability (ARO) for future plugging and abandonment costs. A
liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and
abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the
full cost pool at the time a new well is drilled. Depreciation
expense associated with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is
recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.

 

The
Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment
costs based on historical experience and estimated well life. The
liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate.
Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well
plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal
or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

 

A

Party Transactions




 

In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, MD has been
appointed as the Partnership’s managing general partner. MD
has no significant equity interest in the Partnership. Mewbourne
Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and gas
properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is
the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are
with MD and MOC.

 

In the
ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will
be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

 

In
accordance with the Partnership agreement, during any particular
calendar year the total amount of administrative expenses allocated
to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5%
of the Partnership’s gross revenue from the sale of oil and
natural gas production during each year (calculated without any
deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b)
the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of
limited and general partners.

The
Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through the
Program. The Partnership and MD are the parties to the Program, and
the costs and revenues are allocated between them as
follows:

As noted
above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of
organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which
should approximate 20% of total capital costs. To the extent that
organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are
less than 20% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for
tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program’s
total capital costs reaches approximately 20%. The
Partnership’s financial statements reflect its respective
proportionate interest in the Program.

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

Mewbourne
Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the “Partnership”) was
formed November 16, 2005. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began July 11, 2006 and concluded September
1, 2006, with total investor contributions of $50,000,000. During
2008, all general partner equity interests were converted to
limited partner equity interests.

 

Future
capital requirements and operations will be conducted with
available funds generated from oil and gas activities. No bank
borrowing is anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital
of $193,253 at September 30, 2016.

 

The
Partnership had reduced cash flows from operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 due to the steep decline in oil and
gas prices during the previous twelve months. Considering these
reduced operating cashflows, the Partnership anticipates smaller
distributions until prices improve.

 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership made cash
distributions to the investor partners (including state tax
payments for the benefit of investor partners) in the amount of
$308,301 as compared to $767,571 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Since inception, the Partnership has made
distributions of $56,684,123, inclusive of state tax
payments.

 

The sale
of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be
affected by a number of factors that are beyond the
Partnership’s control. These factors include the price of
crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for
these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production
and sale of crude
