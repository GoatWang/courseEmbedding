Extremely comfortable right from the first wearing. Like being barefoot but with some support. Stylish, casual. A pleasure to wear.

These are the perfect loafer from dressing work casual to just throwing them on for some fun around town. I love the simple Jack Rogers design. Fit true to size for me, the leather did give a bit but that was to be expected. They are great.

Since it is not possible to guarantee our online colors will look the same on all computers, we do not guarantee that what you see accurately portrays the color of the actual product. If it is important that the sample be exact, we highly recommended that you order a swatch sample first, before placing the order.Note about assembly: Manufacturers often put the furniture legs in the lining underneath the couch. Typically, there's a bag with the assembly materials located near a zipper in the lining.

Great Couch
















Verified Purchase


This couch is beautiful and well worth the money.  We searched for a few weeks for a dark blue velvet couch for our living room area and this couch does not disappoint.  The navy blue is exactly as pictured. Very easy assembly.  Would highly recommend.  It is not in our primary family room so we don't sit on it often but it is comfortable and a stunning piece.

Perfect Couch












Verified Purchase

We knew we wanted a blue couch in the front living room of our new home a year before our home was finished. This couch fulfilled our vision. It's a royal, rich blue and it was a snap to assemble. Its the first thing guests see when they enter our home.

Style and comfortable Sitting

Sturdy. Soft. Comfortable. Stylish. 
You don't really sleep in this couch, its more for sitting. It is not deep, but it is a fantastic sitting couch.

Great Couch












Verified Purchase


This couch is beautiful and well worth the money.  We searched for a few weeks for a dark blue velvet couch for our living room area and this couch does not disappoint.  The navy blue is exactly as pictured. Very easy assembly.  Would highly recommend.  It is not in our primary family room so we don't sit on it often but it is comfortable and a stunning piece.

LOVE this couch












Verified Purchase


I looked for quite awhile for a chesterfiled-style couch in a rich blue. I didn't want to spend over $2k, which seems to be the going price. This couch is well made, comfortable and looks like it cost about two times the price. I am so glad I bought it- I will love this for years to come!

Perfect!












Verified Purchase


The sofas couldn't be better.  The color is even nicer than I had envisioned and the sofas are extremely comfortable.  Also, the fabric feels very nice to the touch. I have 2 of these sofas and I couldn't be happier with them.

I can't say enough good things












Verified Purchase


The sofa is incredibly comfortable, with soft fabric in such a rich color.  Everyone who comes over cant stop complimenting it.
The delivery was very smooth, and the only assembly required was screwing on the legs.  
I'd buy this sofa again in a heartbeat.

Beautiful couch for the money












Verified Purchase


 Great couch, very comfortable and seems to be made of quality material. The only thing is, the color is a touch more electric blue then it is the dark navy as it appears on the computer screen, FYI.

LOVE this sofa!












Verified Purchase


This is beautiful and seems very well made! I love it in my living room. I only have a bit of trouble keeping it looking nice. I vacuum it or use a lint roller on it weekly because it does shows a lot of things. I had a darling pillow on it with burlap flowers, had to return the pillow bc it had little pieces of burlap that would cover the sofa and I was lint rolling daily. SO be careful what you allow to sit on the sofa. It will show everything.

Gorgeous!

I had been wanting a velvet navy blue couch for a while and finally decided to get it. Shipping was fast and arrived in perfect condition I cannot say enough good things about it. The fabric is great quality and comfortable to sit on we use this couch daily and couldn't be happier. This baby really classes up a room!

Beautiful Couch












Verified Purchase


The couch is very soft and comfortable.  Fits nicely in my small living room.   I purchased a grey/black vintage rug and light grey curtains to go with it, and it they compliment one another well.  I recommend this couch to anyone looking for a modern classy couch that is also useful for sitting and watching a good long movie.

Awesome sofa












Verified Purchase


The couch is beautiful, so so comfy for seating or lounging. The only con is that it attracts lint requiring regular rolling. If you have shedding pets particularly with light hair it's probably not for you. I recommend it to all others looking for a practical sofa that feels like a statement piece.

So pretty and comfy!












Verified Purchase


This couch is super pretty and soft and very comfortable to sit or sleep on.
Despite the description, and what Overstock.com said when I chatted them to ask, it DOES include two cylinder bolster pillows!

Also, somehow it was delivered freakishly fast. I got it within 2 business days, which was great (except they never told me when they were delivering it until the guy was on his way, so it was left outside my apartment in a giant box until i got home from work)

I'm very happy with the couch :) Hope it lasts!

I was sitting on my loveseat about 10 minutes after opening the box. PS the colour of mine looks like red with a hint of burgundy mixed in. So, if you are looking for a garden variety tomato red sofa, this isn't it. Great sofaI ordered 2 of these sofas for a clubhouse and they are not only great looking but they are comfortable. Great Set of Furniture, But..We purchased this sofa and loveseat set on line. It was on sale but on the following day the price came down for about *** I called Overstock and they agreed to give us a store credit for this amount which was nice of them, and it appeared that everything is moving smoothly. The advertised price included Free Shipping and here was the problem. Traditionally, and from several prior experiences, whether there is a shipping cost or not, the furniture would be delivered to the designated address and placed at the room of our choice including assembly if needed. For Overstock and for large furniture items, it's different story. They list on their website several delivery options. So if you want the furniture delivered INSIDE the house and placed at the room of your choice, there would be an extra charge even if it says FREE SHIPPING. Because I omitted reading the shipping section before placing my order, knowing that it's free shipping, we went through a real hell before a supervisor, who is a true professional and gentleman from Overstock Customer Service, stepped in and resolved the problem. After several days of delay in delivering the furniture, it came in and placed in our Living Room. The set is gorgeous, the "dolphin gray" color we selected turned to be exactly what we expected and the set was in excellent condition. All-in-all it was a great purchase and we are so happy with it. I strongly recommend that Overstock reviews its contract with their "Shipping" and Delivery" subcontractors to ensure that their actions and delivery practices wouldn't adversely impact Overstock reputation.  Just what I was looking forI bought the loveseat last month, and really liked it, so when I saw it on sale during Cyber Monday, I decided to get the matching sofa.  It's a perfect match and I love the look.  This piece did not come with directions on assembly, so I had to wing it from my memory of putting my loveseat together.Good buyShopped for this for over a year. Although I have only owned for a month this loveseat has surpassed my expectations. Super comfortable, good quality, very affordable. I was reluctant to purchase furniture I had not examined and sat on, but the pre-holiday sales made it too good a deal to pass up.NiceI love this sofa set. Looks exact same like a picture. I ordered gray sofa set and I am very satisfied with this product Good looking but not comfortable.The loveseat is very good looking. However, it is very firm, doesn't feel like sofa when you sit on it.Best couch ever! I have the loveseat and sofa bed couch, they are very heavy very well made. I have had alot of couches these are the best!!!Great  looking midgrade loveseat for show only.  I am moving soon and bought this sofa for staging my home before the sale. It looks really nice, it was easy to put together, but it is very small and not the most comfortable. It was what I was looking for, and serves the purpose because I did not want to buy an investment piece that would perhaps be scratched or damaged during the move. I don't know which house I will wind up in and this will probably wind up in a home office or guest room. However, it looks nice in a small to midsize room. But, if you are used to a cushy sofa that you can stretch out, or cuddle up in, for movie watching or napping, go for a longer, higher end sofa. Sponsored LinksWhat's This?

Overview
Jack Taylor’s experience of the Spirit-filled life, particularly through a powerful movement of God in the early 1970s, has led him to teach principles that transform lives and prove their value both in the heat of Spirit revival and in the practicalities of daily life. Filled with inspired messages that have withstood the test of time, including Taylor’s most popular sermon, “The Rod of God,” these volumes usher the reader toward a more complete joy in the Christian life.
The Logos Bible Software edition of The Jack Taylor Collection enhances your study of the Spirit-filled life. Scripture passages link directly to your preferred English translations and original-language texts, and important theological concepts link to dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a wealth of other resources in your digital library. Powerful topical searches help you find what other authors, scholars, and theologians bring to this conversation.

After the Spirit Comes

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 1974
Pages: 130

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




After the Spirit Comes explores the Holy Spirit’s impact on the life of a believer and offers guidance on the basics about Christian life—Bible reading, prayer, and the expectations of a Spirit-filled life. This book helps guide Christians to fully live in Christ. This volume also contains Taylor’s most popular sermon, “The Rod of God.”







God’s New Creation

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 1987
Pages: 190

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




With the popularity of the self-help culture and “pop theology,” many believers are left confused—following rabbit-trails that leave them disconnected from Christ and wondering who they really are. God’s New Creation helps Christians rediscover who they are in Christ.







Much More

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 142

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Much More contains timeless, universal messages that enrich lives. The messages in this book take you deeper into biblical truths that can glorify practical living and point you toward joy.







Prayer: Life’s Limitless Reach

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 2005
Pages: 190

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Prayer: Life’s Limitless Reach shows that nothing is beyond the reach of prayer because nothing lies beyond the reach of God. Jack Taylor argues that lack of prayer is the source of many battles that we fight, and that the failure of the church and the individual Christian is a failure of prayer; he reminds the reader that without prayerfulness, all works are missing their deeper meaning.







The Hallelujah Factor

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 1999
Pages: 191

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In The Hallelujah Factor, Jack Taylor challenges the reader to experience the most enriching activity in heaven and earth—praise. Reminding us that praise is the full-time occupation of the angels in heaven, Taylor claims that the practice of praise can change a life, encouraging readers to release the full experience of praise into their lives.







The Key to Triumphant Living

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 158

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The Key to Triumphant Living is the personal testimony of a man who had accomplished everything the world said would fulfill him, but still found himself empty. This experience of corporate revival and personal renewal through an emphasis on the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit will provide encouragement for all who read it.







The Word of God with Power

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 2003
Pages: 192

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The Word of God with Power helps readers rediscover the vitality of the living Word of God and the empowering ministry of the Holy Spirit. Jack Taylor reveals the power that comes from experiencing the combined work of God’s Spirit and his Word. This discussion of God’s power can bring a renewed energy to your spiritual life.







Victory over the Devil

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 148

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The devil and demons are largely ignored in modern Christianity because they are quietly assumed to exist instead of firmly resisted. Victory over the Devil affirms their existence and gives certain hope of applied victory both in the individual and in the church itself. This book takes a fresh look at what the Bible says about the devil, demons, angels, and the believer’s authority in Jesus Christ. Jack Taylor equips readers with the spiritual weapons to combat and defeat the devil. This book will explain the unexplainable from Scripture and prepare you to confront spiritual enemies and cooperate with spiritual allies.







Which, Being Interpreted, Means

Author: Jack Taylor
Publisher: Jack Taylor
Publication Date: 1996
Pages: 180

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Which, Being Interpreted, Means argues that laughter originated with God and is among the greatest gifts from God to mankind. No area of our lives is so packed with “laughables” as our church life, where Christians walk, talk and think. “Lighten up” is the theme of this cartoon book which pokes fun at the way we live, even in church.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Proven Formula for a Balanced, Effective Christian LifeToo often churches emphasize the Bible without welcoming the work of the Holy Spirit, who inspired the Bible. Or they focus on seeking manifestations of the Spirit while neglecting sound Bible teaching. The result: a schism in their faith lives in which they cut God--and his power--out of Christianity's equation. How can God draw a lost world to his Son through people who are powerless?With over 170 years of diverse ministry experience among them, respected veteran leaders R. T. Kendall, Charles Carrin, and Jack Taylor restore balance to the Christian walk. They show that when the Word is faithfully preached and the Holy Spirit warmly welcomed, the Lord manifests his power, bringing salvation, miracles, healings, heart understanding, and much more. Only when Christians honor the Word and the Spirit can they lead empowered, fruitful lives.


Author Bio▼▲
Dr. R. T. Kendall, a graduate of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Oxford University (DPhil), is a protege of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. He was the senior minister of the historic Westminster Chapel in London for 25 years. The author of numerous bestselling books, he conducts conferences all over the world and writes a bimonthly column for Ministry Today. He and his wife, Louise, live near Nashville, Tennessee.Charles Carrin has been in ministry more than 50 years, most of which time his beliefs and practices denied the supernatural works and gifts of the Holy Spirit. A crisis time in his own life, however, caused him to revise his theology. Today his ministry is characterized by displays of the power of God in salvation as well as deliverance and healing. He lives in Boynton Beach, Florida.Jack Taylor has a ministry that spans more than 54 years, during which he has witnessed various moves of God in revival. His life has been punctuated by encounters with the Holy Spirit that have changed his life and ministry. He is a frequent speaker in areas where revival has broken out, and he has a passion to see the church become Kingdomcentered and empowered by the Spirit. He and his wife, Friede, live near Melbourne, Florida.

            WORD Spirit POWER


What Happens When You Seek All God Has to Offer


By R.T. Kendall


Charles Carrin


Jack Taylor


There is a divorce in the Church that has rendered it ineffective and powerless. But in our efforts to remain busy we haven't realized what we are missing. We have divorced the Word of God from His Spirit.


Word Spirit Power will help us bring about a remarriage of the Word and the Spirit in today's Church. Word + Spirit = Power


Many believe that signs and wonders were ended when the the Book of Revelation was penned, but the truth is we don't experience the signs and wonders because we have separated the Scriptures from the power of God. To preach the Gospel without the power of God behind it we are merely teaching words. This coming together of Scripture with the power of God's Spirit is what gave strength and meaning to Peter's preaching on the Day of Pentecost. God's power is what lies behind the miraculous and it is the irresistible force behind preaching.


Today many Christians are like the Sadducees, we are ignorant of the Scriptures and the power of God. We must daily read and study the Bible so that when we have need of its guidance and wisdom the Holy Spirit can bring it our mind. The Bible is a record of God's integrity. And it is through God's name that signs and wonders were done proclaiming the truth of His Word. Even the hymns of today are powerless because there is no theology that we sing unlike those of Issac Watts and Charles Wesley. When we come to Christianity with the attitude of "What's in it for me?" we are missing the point. The Cross appeased God's wrath at our sinfulness. God owes us nothing! We must humble ourselves before God and thank Him for what He has already given us.


To return to what God has intended us to be we must pursue "the Third Person of the Trinity, Holy Spirit" It is only through the Holy Spirit that we can truly be aware of God's presence in our lives. The Holy Spirit was sent by God to unify the Church and to enable us to accomplish the purpose God has created us, as the Church, for. But somewhere along the way we seemed to lose our awareness of the Spirit's presence and began viewing Him with fear and doubt.


To experience true spiritual renewal we must recover the original purpose of the Holy Spirit. Today's Church "lacks the heart and power to recover the glory of the church of Acts," instead it is under a cloud of oppression struggling to survive. This is the time when we should return to God and the Bible - a time of spiritual awakening.


The religious world uses terms that divide and exclude, but God wants us to be inclusive. As Christians we can have disagreements but we must not become disagreeable so that by our very words and actions we cause others to close eyes and ears to God!


If we refuse the Spirit we are refusing God and we are refusing Jesus as they are one. To be in God we must be in the Spirit, we must trust Him as we trust the Father and the Son. When the Spirit came on those first believers of the early Church they were filled with a boldness they had not previously had. But this was not an offering to only the first believers, but to believers today as well. We must allow the Spirit to provide us with the power by revealing the meaning of God's Word to us His Children!


We must not allow our ego or pride to hinder the Spirit. We must crucify our ego so that we don't handicap the Spirit's work in our lives and limit our effectiveness both within and without the Church. We must not allow the legalism of doctrine to cause us to reject the both the Spirit and the works of the Spirit. It is only when the Spirit become real to the individual believer "that religion is replaced with authentic spirituality and power."


Word Spirit Power takes an interesting look at the Church and what is wrong with it. Are you willing to to accept the gift that has been given to the Church and to the Kingdom?


I received a copy of this book from Chosen a division of Baker Books for the purpose of this review. All opinions expressed are my own.

            If you could describe your walk with God as shallow, unexciting, powerless, empty or dull- then you need to read "Word, Spirit, Power"- immediately. The first chapter, (R.T. Kendall's self-introduction) is something of a dry start, though you'll come to appreciate his academic tone. If by chance it doesn't grow on you, but you long to see the power of God in the church today, and in your own life in particular, just push through - it will be more than worth it. Kendall teaches on the importance of knowing God's Word, while Charles Carrin teaches out of his unique experience on the importance of understanding the work of the Holy Spirit and the need for the Holy Spirit in the Christian's life. Jack Taylor concludes with the section on Power - the outcome of a life lived in the Word and in the Spirit. You will discover each author's reverence for Scripture and ability to teach profoundly yet convey the message plainly. That bears repeating: you don't have to be a seminary student to appreciate the depth of teaching - these men are remarkably good at keeping it simple. Though each writer shares a good deal from his own experiences, this is NOT a book full of experiential claims loosely supported by random Scripture verses. It is a challenging, thought-provoking, and humbly presented call to lay down your pride, your ego, possibly your doctrine, and probably the qualifications and pre-conditions you (knowingly or not) attach to your prayer for more of God, so that you truly can be filled with the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit. I am convinced that the message in "Word, Spirit, Power" could be a catalyst for phenomenal individual and corporate revival. If I could, I would put this book into the hands of every Christian I know and I unreservedly recommend that you read it. I am absolutely confident that God will use the message in this book powerfully in your life. Be warned, upon reading it you will find areas of disbelief, doubt, and pride that you didn't know were there, lurking within you. As a result you may find yourself on your face before God in repentance and desperation - but can you think of any better place to be?


I received a complimentary copy of this book for review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255.

            This book really expands on the importance of not only being equipped with knowledge of the bible but also the importance of being filled with the Holy Spirit which gives us power to serve God using the gifts that are accessible to us. The Holy Spirit also allows us to hear God's voice, feel his love and enables us to live according to God's will when we are obedient to His word, seeking what he has to offer. The author's give amazing testimonies of their experiences with the Holy Spirit and how it came to be. I really enjoyed reading about the transformation of Tom's life and how he was used by the Holy Spirit. That demonstrates God is always near and will place people in our lives for a season to fulfill a need. Truth is in the word, power is in the truth and Holy Spirit is in the power as mentioned in this book really sums it up. I believe after reading this book, many will pursue the Holy Spirit. It has helped me on my journey. Thanks Bethany House Publishing for the opportunity to read this book free of charge.

            How often have we felt as R.T. Kendall describes in this book, theologically sound but powerless. This book describes seeking God for the power of the Holy Spirit. The authors are not content to simply teach biblical truths or to be sound in their theology but they want to see the power of God manifested in His Church through healings, through signs and wonders, through the gifts of the Spirit. Like many others, they are tired of going through the motions of "church" and they want to see the living God.


My thoughts on the book are that the authors do give you a hunger for God. I agreed with them that our God is a living God. God is not dead. He didn't give us the Bible and then abandon us. He didn't heal people during the ministry of Jesus and the book of Acts only to leave us with the completion of the New Testament. I have read articles and books on the cessation of the manifestation gifts of the Spirit such as speaking in tongues, prophecy, or healing and while I agree that there can be abuses of these gifts, I find the arguments in favor of their cessation based on a philosophy more than a theology. I agreed with the authors that the Bible is given to us not to replace the supernatural but to correct abuses of it. This was a good point. The book focuses on the experiences of the authors and then allows the authors to write short chapters on seeking God and His power.


What are the weaknesses of the book? First, while I am not a full cessationist, I would call myself a "partial cessationist." Why? Because I believe the healings of Jesus and the Apostles were unique to the work of God. The healings of Jesus, for example, showed He was the Messiah and verified that He was sent from God (John 3:2; 6:38; Acts 10:38). The Apostles likewise were able to perform miracles to demonstrate their validity (Acts 14:3). Few would claim to be able to do miracles as Jesus or the Apostles did and few (if any) would ever claim to be speaking on the same level as God spoke through Jesus or the Apostles. No doubt the Lord Jesus and the Apostles carried a unique authority from God to glorify His name. While I agree that all disciples of Jesus are now full of the Spirit (Acts 2:38), few if any would claim to be speaking on the same level as say Paul the Apostle or would claim to heal as Jesus healed (Matthew 4:23-25). I have never witnessed a special and unique healing such as raising the dead. While I believe God can raise the dead, I have never heard of a verified raising of the dead. I believe that since the completion of the New Testament, God is not speaking the same to us as He did through the Apostles. Few, other than cults, would disagree.


That said, the book does give me a hunger for more of God. I truly do believe that God answers prayer. I believe He is certainly able to do miracles. I believe He longs to hear our cries (John 14:13-14). I believe that prayer is powerful not because prayer itself has power but because of the intercessory work of Jesus Christ who sits at the right hand of God the Father (Hebrews 4:14-16). Jesus is our faithful high priest (Hebrews 7:25) and because He is praying for us before the Father, we can pray and I believe God can do mighty things to exalt His name and His glory in the earth. I believe, as the authors do, that we should pray great and mighty prayers. While we do not know the will of God, we can know that God does desire to glorify His name (Ephesians 3:20-21). Faith in God can move mountains (Mark 11:22-24).


Overall, this book will generate a passion for the Lord Jesus and His presence. Critics won't find much to wrestle with here except perhaps the experiences of the authors. The chapters are given not to theologically show our need for God and His power but to generate a hunger for God. I am hungry for God. I want Him to move in power in my life. I want to see souls saved for the glory of God and I want Jesus to be exalted in answering our cries. Truly He is a mighty God!
