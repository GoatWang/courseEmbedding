The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. Key Developments

Affiliate of was Development Files Lawsuit against The One Group Hospitality Inc. and its STK-Branded Restaurant
Jun 2 17
An affiliate of was Development has filed a lawsuit against The ONE Group Hospitality Inc. and its STK-branded restaurant, alleging breach of lease and breach of guarantee for a planned 8,323-square-foot restaurant space at the C Block of Seaport Square. was Development alleges in the suit filed in Suffolk County Superior Court that ONE Group failed to submit complete construction plans, failed to submit a complete liquor license application from Boston's Licensing Board and subsequently failed 'to use all diligent efforts to obtain a liquor license, including but not limited to purchasing the same.' The lawsuit alleges STK did not satisfy its obligation under the lease to apply for a liquor license by Sept. 30, 2016. Rather, ONE Group and STK applied for a non-transferable liquor license, which the city licensing board denied on Jan. 30, the lawsuit states. On Feb. 7, was notified STK that it was in default, and followed that with a March 30 notification that the lease was terminated. The lease acknowledged the state-imposed limit on liquor licenses, and as such included a caveat in the lease reflecting 'the parties' shared understanding that STK would likely need to 'obtain' the liquor license by purchasing the same and securing the requisite governmental approvals for the transfer, the lawsuit states. was Development alleges that in the January 2016 lease signed by STK and was Development, STK was obligated to pay minimum rent and additional rent for the first 36 months of the lease. was Development alleges it has lost minimum rent payments of $45,082.92 per month as well as additional rental fees including STK's share of real-estate taxes, common area maintenance expenses and utilities. Martin Fantozzi and Kaileigh Callender of Goulston & Storrs filed the lawsuit on behalf of was Development.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

An affiliate of Chestnut Hill-based retail development firm WS Development has filed a lawsuit against The ONE Group Hospitality Inc. and its STK-branded restaurant, alleging breach of lease and breach of guarantee for a planned 8,323-square-foot restaurant space at the C Block of Seaport Square.




WS Development alleges in the suit filed Thursday in Suffolk County Superior Court that ONE Group (Nasdaq: STKS) failed to submit complete construction plans, failed to submit a complete liquor license application from Boston’s Licensing Board and subsequently failed “to use all diligent efforts to obtain a liquor license, including but not limited to purchasing the same.”

Courtesy of The One Group Hospitality Inc.










 


ONE Group first announced in January 2016 it was bringing an STK Rebel, a modern steakhouse targeting female customers, in the Seaport Square mixed-use development in late 2017. In the announcement, ONE Group CEO Jonathan Segal said, “We are thrilled and honored to partner with WS Development and be welcomed by Boston’s hottest new neighborhood, surrounded by the best in entertainment, retail and real estate." Several media outlets picked up the announcement, calling STK Rebel a "female-friendly" steakhouse. But that December, food blog Eater Boston reported that the STK Rebel spinoff concept was not moving forward in Boston.




 


The lawsuit alleges STK did not satisfy its obligation under the lease to apply for a liquor license by Sept. 30, 2016. Rather, ONE Group and STK applied for a non-transferable liquor license, which the city licensing board denied on Jan. 30, the lawsuit states. On Feb. 7, WS notified STK that it was in default, and followed that with a March 30 notification that the lease was terminated.
The lease acknowledged the state-imposed limit on liquor licenses, and as such included a caveat in the lease reflecting “the parties’ shared understanding that STK would likely need to ‘obtain’ the liquor license by purchasing the same and securing the requisite governmental approvals for the transfer,” the lawsuit states.
WS Development alleges that in the January 2016 lease signed by STK and WS Development, STK was obligated to pay minimum rent and additional rent for the first 36 months of the lease. WS Development alleges it has lost minimum rent payments of $45,082.92 per month as well as additional rental fees including STK’s share of real-estate taxes, common area maintenance expenses and utilities.

Martin Fantozzi and Kaileigh Callender of Goulston & Storrs filed the lawsuit on behalf of WS Development.
A WS Development representative declined to comment on Friday, saying the firm does not comment on pending litigation. A representative from The ONE Hospitality Group did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Driving Direct Bookings
One of the biggest challenges faced by independent hotels is trying to maximize direct bookings. Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Orbitz and others serve an important role in funneling new business to hotels, but they take a hefty commission in return. While we believe this is a key piece of developing a hotel’s customer base, it is critical that those guests do not return to the OTAs for their next booking. And, if we can get a guest book direct for their first booking, that’s even better. Knowing this, Charlestowne has made a concerted effort to drive direct bookings up front, and convert OTA guests into direct booking guests when they return. Our results speak for themselves. Based on our internal data, compared against nationwide data from Smith Travel Research, independent hotels managed by Charlestowne Hotels earn direct bookings at three times the national average, resulting in a mix that is 76% direct, 24%OTA.

Independent Direct BookingsUS Industry Average: 25% vs. Charlestowne Hotels: 76%
Franchised Brand Direct Bookings US Industry Average: 64% vs. Charlestowne Hotels: 77%





Charlestowne Hotels OutperformsUS Industry on Direct Bookings





 











Best Performing Hotel in the US by STR
King Charles Inn, operated by Charlestowne Hotels, was recognized above 4,645 eligible properties in the midscale segment. The winning properties were selected from each of seven market scale segments based on reported occupancy, average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR) performance against their respective segment performance.
 “We are extremely proud of the associates at King Charles, led by General Manager Maureen Sheridan, as well as the corporate revenue team, for their exceptional work in generating these results,” stated Michael Tall, President and COO of Charlestowne Hotels. “We believe we have assembled not only the best operational teams at our properties, but also the most dynamic ecommerce, marketing and revenue management team in the country; such results are a testament to that fact. Likewise, the staff at King Charles consistently receives excellent reviews for their service, which creates loyal guests that are so important to any hotel.”
