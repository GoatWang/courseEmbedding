Rebecca Clary













                    
                    Rebecca Clary was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis November 2008 after an episode sitting in a store parking lot convinced her to stop driving until she got her eyes checked. 2 days, 3 appointments, and a 6 hour long hospital visit later she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. The next 6 weeks included severe vision problems,  balance issues, seizures, and brain fog. Mikey, Beka's husband, was serving in the US Army at the time of her diagnosis and was stationed in Germany. He was rushed home to take care of the children. She had 2 children at the time,  an 18 month old and a 9 month old, and  gave birth to her 3rd child 16 months after diagnosis. Shocked by the lack of support groups for parents with MS, she founded the Parenting With MS Support Group in 2009, and wrote and published the My Mommy Has MS children's book series in 2013.

 Understanding MS (Multiple Sclerosis)


Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-inflammatory disease in which the immune  system attacks its own nervous system. More than 2 million people worldwide  suffer from the disease, with some of the highest rates occurring in Canada and  the U.S. Some speculate that due to its prevalence among women (more than twice  as likely to be effected) and those in colder climates, high estrogen and low  sunlight (vitamin D) levels could be contributing risk factors. The reality i

 A typical day in the park.


Sitting on a bench, I looked up at the sky, watching the clouds lazily roll past on a beautiful spring day.  I was at the park closest to my home.  It’s one of my favorite places to clear my head, read a book, or meet some of the other folks in the community.  I lingered on the clouds for a moment and then looked down as I heard the sounds of young children approaching.  I saw a mother with her three little ones. She was using a couple of canes to help her walk.  I sm
