Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

	The Keywise Greater China Strategy focuses on high growth, under researched companies in Greater China Markets, mainly China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. The strategy aims to generate absolute returns and exploit extreme valuations in the mid and large cap segments of the Greater China markets.

	The Keywise Phoenix Development Fund focuses primarily on long securities in the Greater China region.  The Fund seeks to achieve superior relative returns and exploit extreme valuations, where securities trade at a significant discount to fundamental value.

	The Keywise Penguin Development Fund seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted absolute return with low volatility through investing in equities in the Greater China market. The competitive edge of the Fund relies on its rigorous stock selection approach based on independent on-the-ground due diligence and research.

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.
