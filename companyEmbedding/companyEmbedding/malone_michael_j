DECISIONS OF NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD 

Michael J. Malone and Bob Burkheimer d/b/a Sorrento Hotel and Hotel, Motel, Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, Local 8, AFLCIO. Cases 19-CA-12766 and 19-CA-12831
March 7, 1983 DECISION AND ORDER
BY CHAIRMAN MILLER AND MEMBERS
JENKINS AND ZIMMERMAN
On July 29, 1982, Administrative Law Judge Richard J. Boyce issued the attached Decision in this proceeding. Thereafter, Respondent filed exceptions and a supporting brief;' Hotel, Motel,
Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union,
Local 8, AFL-CIO, the Charging Party, filed a reply brief; and the General Counsel filed a brief in opposition to Respondent's exceptions.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has considered the record and the attached Decision in light of the exceptions and briefs and has decided to affirm the rulings, findings, 2 and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge and to adopt his recommended Order, as modified below.3 ' Respondent's request to reopen the record for the introduction of additional evidence is hereby denied as the record as made at the hearing is adequate for the purposes of our decision and the evidence Respondent seeks to introduce is neither new nor previously unavailable. In any event, even if the evidence were to be considered and credited, the outcome of this case would remain the same.
2 Respondent has excepted to certain credibility findings made by the Administrative Law Judge. It is the Board's established policy not to overrule an administrative law judge's resolutions with respect to credibility unless the clear preponderance of all of the relevant evidence convinces us that the resolutions are incorrect. Standard Dry Wall Products,
Inc., 91 NLRB 544 (1950), enfd. 188 F.2d 362 (3d Cir 1951). We have carefully examined the record and find no basis for reversing his findings.
3 In our recent decision in Parker-Robb Chevrolet, Inc., 262 NLRB 408 (1982), we held that the protection of the Act does not extend to supervisors who are disciplined or discharged asa result of their participation in union or concerted activities. In so doing, we overruled those cases which held that a violation is established when the discipline or discharge of a supervisor is an 'integral part' of an employer's pattern of unlawful conduct directed against employees, the theory on which the Administrative Law Judge relied in ordering Respondent to reinstate and make whole any supervisors discharged by Respondent. Accordingly, we conclude, for the reasons fully set forth in Parker-Robb, that there is no basis here for finding the discharge of the supervisors unlawful. The Administrative Law Judge's recommended Order is therefore modified to delete that portion of par. 2(d), fn. 31, extending the remedial order of this Decision to any supervisors discharged by Respondent on September 22, 1980. Additionally, the phrase 'those terminated,' contained in par. 2(d) of the Administrative Law Judge's recommended Order, is hereby clarified to encompass only statutory employees.
For the reasons set forth in his concurrence in Parker-Robb, Member Jenkins would affirm that portion of the Administrative Law Judge's recommended Order requiring Respondent to reinstate, with backpay, any supervisors discharged by Respondent on September 22, 1980.
In his recommended Order, the Administrative Law Judge also ordered Respondent to, upon the Union's request, reinstate pension and health and welfare coverages as they existed on August I, 1980, and to 266 NLRB No. 67 ORDER
Pursuant to Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board adopts as its Order the recommended Order of the Administrative Law Judge, as modified below, and hereby orders that the Respondent,
Michael J. Malone and Bob Burkheimer d/b/a Sorrento Hotel, Seattle, Washington, its officers, agents, successors, and assigns, shall take the action set forth in the said recommended Order, as so modified:
1. Delete paragraph 3 of footnote 31 of the Administrative Law Judge's Decision.
2. Insert 'statutory employees' after 'those' and before 'terminated' in paragraph 2(d).
3. Insert 'statutory employees on' after 'terminations of' and before 'September 22' in paragraph 2(e).
4. Substitute the attached notice for that of the Administrative Law Judge.
make employees whole for any loss of benefits they may have suffered as a result of Respondent's unilateral changes. While we agree with this section of the Administrative Law Judge's recommended Order, in no event should it be construed as requiring Respondent to provide double coverage to its employees in these areas.
APPENDIX
NOTICE To EMPLOYEES POSTED BY ORDER OF THE
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
An Agency of the United States Government The hearing held in Seattle, Washington, on February 1-2, 1982, in which we participated and had a chance to give evidence, resulted in a decision that we had committed unfair labor practices in violation of Section 8(a)(l), (3), and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and this notice is posted pursuant to that decision.
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act gives all employees the following rights:
To organize themselves To form, join, or support unions To bargain as a group through a representative they choose To act together for collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection To refrain from any or all such activity except to the extent that the employees' bargaining representative and employer have a collective-bargaining agreement which imposes a lawful requirement that employees become union members.
350
SORRENTO HOTEL WE WILL NOT refuse to recognize and bargain collectively with Hotel, Motel, Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, Local 8, AFL-CIO, as the exclusive representative of our food and beverage and hotel employees in the appropriate unit embraced by the 197881 collective-bargaining agreement between Third Brigade Corporation and said Union, with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment.
WE WILL NOT change any term or condition of employment of the employees in the aforementioned unit, including pension and health and welfare coverages, without first giving the above-named Union a chance to bargain over such change.
WE WILL NOT close portions of our hotel business, with attendant loss of unit work, without first giving the above-named Union a chance to bargain over the effects of such closure.
WE WILL NOT terminate an entire complement of unit employees, or a substantial portion thereof, without first giving the abovenamed Union a chance to bargain over the decision and its effects on those employees.
WE WILL NOT terminate or otherwise discriminate against employees to avoid having to recognize and bargain with the above-named Union, or any other labor organization.
WE WILL NOT in any like or related manner interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in their exercise of rights under Section 7 of the Act.
WE WILL recognize and upon request bargain collectively with the above-named Union, as the exclusive representative of our employees in the aforementioned unit, with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment, and, if an understanding is reached, embody it in a signed document.
WE WILL, upon request of the above-named Union, revoke any or all changes in pension and health and welfare coverages made without first giving the Union a chance to bargain, and, if requested, restore coverages as they existed up to August 1, 1980, maintaining such coverages as are restored until we negotiate with the Union in good faith to agreement or to an impasse in negotiations.
WE WILL make whole employees who worked in the aforementioned unit at any time on or after August 1, 1980, with interest, for any loss of benefits they may have suffered because of the changes in pension and health and welfare coverages made by us without first giving the above-named Union a chance to bargain.
WE WILL offer to those statutory employees terminated on September 22, 1980, if we have have not already done so, immediate and full reinstatement to their former positions or, if such positions no longer exist, to substantially equivalent positions, without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges; and make them whole, with interest, for any loss of earnings they may have suffered because of the discrimination against them.
WE WILL expunge from our files any reference to the terminations of statutory employees on September 22, 1980, and notify those terminated in writing that this has been done and that evidence of those unlawful terminations will not be used as a basis for future personnel actions against them.

Malone and Bob Burkheimer d/b/a Sorrento Hotel violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act) on and after August 8, 1980, by refusing to recognize and bargain with the Union as the representative of the hotel employees; and violated Section 8(a)(5), (3), and (1) on September 22, 1980, by discharging 'substantially all' of the hotel employees without prior notice to, and for the purpose of eliminating, the Union.

We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.
