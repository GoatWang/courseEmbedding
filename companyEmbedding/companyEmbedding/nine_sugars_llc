Process modeling and simulation software used by major sugar companies around the world.













Welcome to Sugars International LLC
Sugars International LLC is proud to present the Sugars™ for Windows® process modeling and simulation software. Sugars is a powerful program to analyze and improve both beet or cane sugar factories and refineries. It has a graphical interface that makes it easy to use, and it is very flexible for modeling different processes.

The Leading Software
Sugars is the world's most widely-used sugar process simulator. Companies and consultants have used the program since 1986 to build realistic models that simulate the behavior of sugar factories and refineries. Users can quickly analyze hundreds, or even thousands, of variations to refine their designs until the process performance is optimized. Drag-and-drop is used to place shapes of equipment stations on the drawing and a connection tool is used to connect the stations with flow streams. Performance data for each station is entered using data entry forms that are accessed by double clicking the station's shape.  Sugars does the mass, heat and color balance calculations and the results give the revenues generated by the process, sugar yield, steam consumption, molasses characteristics, color, electrical production, and other engineering data for every flow stream in the model.

Users have dramatically reduced the time and cost of making process improvements, while significantly improving the performance of their factories.  Sugars is revolutionizing sugar process design for sugar companies, engineering firms, and consultants!

Customer Comments

...there is no substitute for the ease of use and accurateness of the Sugars program at such a reasonable cost.


Sugars helps us avoid those unforeseen problems that can occur with a new project.


...we were able to model a unique approach to processing.  The factory was modified according to the model and it exactly produced the results predicted by Sugars.


...we use it for our daily operations.  It gives us an opportunity to test possibilities prior to implementing them.  The model is built so that it mirrors our factory conditions almost exactly.


In our opinion, Sugars is one of the most useful tools for simulation, calculation and teaching that we have ever used, in the works for improvement of our facilities.


A great added value of Sugars is that you can learn with it.

Baking basics are, well, basic. Core ingredients like flour and sugar (and cornmeal, baking soda and walnuts, for that matter) don't vary a whole lot in composition. They simply are what they are.
So go store-brand on the basics and spend a little more on the extras, like gourmet chocolate chips. There's no substitute for fine chocolate.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
