History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

Request Quote

























 Proud Member of the NTMA 
As the national representative of the precision custom manufacturing industry, the National Tooling and Machining Association exists to tell the story with a powerful voice. Backed by nearly 1,300 members, representing more than $30 billion in sales, the clout we collectively wield is considerable.
 

 
 
 











DP in CNC West Magazine 
DP Products Inc. President and owner, Danny Papadatos, has been in the machining business for 37 years. It started for him at a vocational high school and progressed from there. He “fell into the trade” when he got a job at a local San Jose, CA. machine shop. With an aptitude for machining, he continued his education through various community college programs and hard work.
