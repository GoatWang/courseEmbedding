State Street Global Advisors Strengthens Global SPDR Business with 
      Product and Marketing Appointments






May 02, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management business of 
      State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) today announced two new 
      appointments: Noel Archard has been named head of global SPDR product, 
      and Seth Morrison has been named head of global SPDR marketing. Both 
      will be based in Boston. SSGA is a global leader in exchange traded 
      funds, with $558 billion in ETF assets under management.1



      “Our global SPDR ETF business has a strong track record of product 
      innovation, having introduced the first US listed ETF more than two 
      decades ago, and launched numerous ‘world firsts’ since,” said Rory 
      Tobin, co-head of the global SPDR business. “As our business has 
      expanded and matured, so too have the responsibilities of our product 
      and marketing teams. Both Noel and Seth have strong track records of 
      developing ETF products consistent with client and regulatory 
      requirements. We are delighted to welcome them both to the team, and we 
      look forward to their leadership as we evolve and grow our Global SPDR 
      ETF business.”
    

      In this newly created role, Archard will be responsible for product 
      strategy, innovation, range and lifecycle management for the global SPDR 
      ETF business. He will report in to Cyrus Taraporevala, head of the 
      global institutional group, and Tobin. Archard brings a wealth of 
      knowledge with more than 20 years’ experience in the global asset 
      management industry. Most recently, he was country head of BlackRock in 
      Canada tasked with growing the company across all business lines within 
      this market. Prior to this, Archard held positions at Blackrock and 
      Vanguard, helping to build and establish their ETF programs. He is a 
      graduate of Northwestern University and a CFA Charterholder.
    

      Also in a newly created role, Morrison will be responsible for all 
      marketing activities across the SPDR business in North America, EMEA and 
      APAC. He will report in to Nick Good, co-head of the global SPDR 
      business, and Stephen Tisdalle, chief marketing officer of SSGA. “Both 
      of these new roles demonstrate our commitment to expanding the reach and 
      relevancy of SPDR value-added services and our broad range of ETF 
      investment capabilities to institutional and intermediary clients,” said 
      Good. Additionally Tisdalle commented, “Our ETF business is embracing 
      innovative marketing programs that communicate our perspectives and 
      insights to help investors make informed decisions about their 
      portfolios.”
    

      Morrison joins SSGA from Vanguard where he served as head of Flagship 
      Business Development Group, the high net-worth sales group for their US 
      Retail business. Prior to this, Seth was head of Vanguard’s 
      International Marketing team. Previously, Seth spent more than 10 years 
      at Franklin Templeton where he held multiple global executive roles in 
      marketing and product distribution.

MAKING SMART BETA WORK FOR YOU
In the struggle for returns, the question around smart beta is no longer “should we?” but “how do we?” Making decisions about factor selection, timing and other considerations can be challenging.
                    

                    We hope this information helps illustrate how to put smart beta into practice. And we’re here to help craft a custom solution that fits your needs.

Selecting Factors


FACTORS: THE ESSENCE OF SMART BETA


Target single factors or multi-factor combinations to meet your portfolio objectives. The selection of a specific smart beta approach will depend on your unique investment objectives.


Smart beta strategies harness the power of factors that active managers commonly seek exposure to, while preserving the benefits of traditional passive approaches.






Value






Value




Value stocks are those that trade at a lower price than their fundamentals (earnings, sales, etc.) would imply. Over the long term, low valuation stocks have outperformed 1 high valuation (expensive) names. 2








Size






Size




Smaller capitalization companies have tended to outperform larger capitalization companies over the long term.1








Volatility






Volatility




Creating a portfolio with lower volatility or tilting towards lower risk stocks can likely generate a higher risk-adjusted return than traditional financial theory would suggest.








Quality






Quality




Out of all the factors, quality has perhaps the clearest economic intuition. It makes sense that higher quality companies are rewarded with better returns over the longer term because they are better at deploying capital and generating wealth.1








Momentum






Momentum




Stocks that have done well recently tend to carry on doing well in the near term. By gaining more exposure to stocks that have done well, you can benefit from the momentum premium.1

Extending to fixed income



As yields continue to decline and investors move deeper into credit markets to achieve their goals, quality tilted Fixed Income smart beta strategies are gaining in popularity.


Our strategies focus on extracting value/quality factor premia from both sovereign and corporate credit:





Sovereign credit

A combined factor approach that tilts towards higher quality Sovereigns with an embedded volatility trigger to capture market confidence.




Corporate credit

A combined factor approach that tilts towards issuers where the compensation (value) for default risk (quality) is attractive.









Case Studies


SMART BETA IN ACTION


Institutional Investors See the Difference:  In our recent survey, 76% of those implementing smart beta reported moderate-to-significant improvement in meeting their long-term aims*.


See how your peers are solving their challenges with smart beta.





Enhance Index Exposure




Case study

CHALLENGE
An investor with a US$2.3 billion portfolio invested in a passive S&P 500 Index strategy wanted to remain passive but achieve better risk-adjusted returns.



SOLUTION
Reduce risk and improve return by mixing passive and smart beta strategies. The investor wished to capture value and low volatility factor premia with its smart beta allocations.






Results
INCREASED HISTORICAL RETURNS,REDUCED HISTORICAL VOLATILITY





Improve Return Potential




Case study

CHALLENGE
A UK-based defined benefit pension scheme was seeking ways to improve the return potential of their traditional market cap equity portfolio. The investor was cognizant of the current strategy’s limitations and its vulnerability to large exposures to highly-valued sectors and stocks.


SOLUTION
The client chose SSGA’s multi-factor smart beta strategy consisting of value, quality and volatility factors to improve risk-adjusted returns and diversification of its core passive allocation. The client decided this was a more cost-effective and transparent solution that required relatively low governance when compared to a traditional active portfolio.

Seek Better Outcomes for Matched Portfolios




Case study

CHALLENGE
A US defined benefit fund wanted to improve its fixed income performance relative to liabilities without jeopardizing funding status. The client wanted to extract the quality premium from credit while maintaining duration, yield, rating and maturity of the liability-driven benchmark.


SOLUTION
State Street Global Advisors worked with the client to design a factor-based solution aligned with the investor’s goal of improving return potential while continuing to match assets and liabilities. The approach tilted towards higher quality (measured by default risk), adjusted for value. Ultimately the quality-tilted solution delivered

Results
FUNDING PRESERVED, BETTER RETURNS





Avoid Overdiversifying Active Exposure




Case study

CHALLENGE


                                A US non-profit with assets invested by a number of active managers asked SSGA to conduct a risk-based analysis of its public equity portfolio to understand the drivers of active return. Portfolios that use multiple active strategies may suffer from over-diversification, with managers’ particular styles cancelling each other out
                                
Our analysis showed:

the overall active risk of the aggregate portfolio was low
high exposure to volatile equities and negative exposure to value, meaning the portfolio favoured expensive stocks.





SOLUTION

Re-allocate a portion of the active portfolio to smart beta strategies that provide certain desirable factor exposures that may not be reflected in the portfolio of active managers, such as value and low volatility.
                                    

                                    Design allows for potentially higher active risk, greater flexibility, more control and simplicity.

FOCUSED EXPOSURES, REDUCED FEES





Long-term Return Targeting across Market Cycles




Case study

CHALLENGE
As part of a portfolio review, a manager of DC plans sought options to help achieve specific factor exposure to improve returns over the long term.



SOLUTION
Recognizing that market timing is notoriously difficult, we helped build a solution providing exposure to three underlying traditional factors instead of one. Our client appreciates that the multi-factor strategy permits them to take simple factor exposures — the simplicity and transparency of SSGA’s methodology in building the factor was a key attraction. As an early adopter of the multi-factor approach, our client has since expressed interest in pursuing a similar strategy for its Emerging Market equity exposure in partnership with State Street Global Advisors.

CAN THE WHOLE BE MORE THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS?
BOTTOM-UP TOP-DOWN MULTI-FACTOR PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
By Jennifer Bender and Taie Wang
Journal of Portfolio Management, Special Issue 2016

                                Is it better to combine single-factor portfolios or to build a multi-factor portfolio from the security level? This study examined both approaches and showed that a bottom-up approach produced different and sometimes superior results than combining individual single-factor portfolios.

Important Disclosures Investing involves risk including the risk of loss of principal. The information provided does not constitute investment advice and it should not be relied on as such. It should not be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security. It does not take into account any investor’s particular investment objectives, strategies, tax status or investment horizon. You should consult your tax and financial advisor. All material has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. There is no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the information and State Street shall have no liability for decisions based on such information. Value stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole. They can remain undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Low volatility funds can exhibit relative low volatility and excess returns compared to the Index over the long term; both portfolio investments and returns may differ from those of the Index. The fund may not experience lower volatility or provide returns in excess of the Index and may provide lower returns in periods of a rapidly rising market. Active stock selection may lead to added risk in exchange for the potential outperformance relative to the Index. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, investors in smart beta may diversify across a mix of factors to address cyclical changes in factor performance. However, factors may have high or increasing correlation. All the index performance results referred to are provided exclusively for comparison purposes only. It should not be assumed that they represent the performance of any particular investment. A smart beta strategy does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified cap-weighted index and as such may underperform such an index. The factors to which a smart beta strategy seeks to deliver exposure may themselves undergo cyclical performance. As such, a smart beta strategy may underperform the market or other smart beta strategies exposed to similar or other targeted factors. In fact, we believe that factor premia accrue over the long term (5-10 years), and investors must keep that long time horizon in mind when investing.
