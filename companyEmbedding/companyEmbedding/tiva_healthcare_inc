Joy W. 
Senior Caregiver — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I was a caregiver to my mother who had early-onset Alzheimer. My siblings and I made sure she was fed, clothed, cleaned, and cared for during the 5 years we took care of her. So I have much experience in all of the requirements that are need to aide a mentally ill elder. It takes patience and compassion to care for someone with a mental illness, but it can be done. I have much love and respect for those who take care of others.

A Little About Myself — Ann Arbor, MI 
 In the last 15 years, I have accumulated a vast administrative skill set through personal, educational and occupational experiences and since 2007, I have worked with children between the ages of 0-13 years and Seniors whom have a vast amount of physical, behavioral, emotional, social and cognitive disabilities that require a plethora of therapies and care such as occupational, speech and behavioral therapies, orthopedics's and prosthetic and other needs that I am trained and responsible for provide to each client.

 Hello! My name is Jaz and I'm a bright, smiley, and fun post graduate student in search of a job assisting others while I search for my long-term profession. I am reliable and kind and have always enjoyed helping others. I previously worked with my godmother's elderly mother and enjoyed the time that I spent with her. We were able to talk and play games to build a strong bond that made assisting with other daily living needs, that were difficult for her (bathroom needs, dressing, walking, etc), easier.

 I am currently taking a year off before graduate school before I go back to work on my master's in occupational therapy. I am interested in working with older adults. I enjoy talking with them and getting to hear what different experiences they have had throughout their lives compared to my experiences. My grandfather had Alzheimer's and I have previously worked in a nursing home that specialized in dementia. I also have experience with people who have a had brain trauma, my job before the nursing home was at a rehab facility. I worked with people of all ages. I would make a great companion for any older adult who just needs someone to talk to. I am willing to clean, cook and other household duties that need to be done along with medication administration.

Bridget C. 
 
 I've been a caregiver for 1 year and have experience with someone in a wheelchair. I can also help with any transfers needed (bed, bathroom assistance, etc...). I can also help with cooking and cleaning if needed. I think the best part about being a caregiver is not only becoming a friend but being able to help someone do everyday activities no matter their condition or limitations.

Capable And Compassionate Caregiver. — Ann Arbor, MI 
 Ever since I was a Teenager I found helping others deeply rewarding. While I was in high school I taught swimming to mentally and physically disabled children. The job was a catalyst for my future in care-giving. I was a live in companion and caregiver for 6 years for a woman who was on dialysis and had early signs of dementia. Recently I have been working with an elderly couple in their home who have late stage Alzheimer's and Hospice care. I am very comfortable with all aspects of their daily needs. Bathing, medications, meal planning, shopping, light house keeping, companionship and take great pride in providing them with dignity and a little humor! o

Carolyn G. 
Warm And Responsible Teacher Looking For Part-time Work With Seniors — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I'm a doctoral student (in education). I'm especially interested in senior care because of the positive influence my grandmothers have had on my life. (They are seriously the strongest and most wonderful women!) I haven't had a lot of experience working with seniors, but I have volunteered for Meals on Wheels for the past year and enjoyed it a lot, so I am already connected to the senior community in Ann Arbor. I'm responsible and self-motivated and interested in helping out with errands or light housework. Looking forward to meeting you and getting to know you!

(1) 

Experienced Special Needs Home Care Provider — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I was responsible for a 16-year-old girl with Down syndrome. I assisted her with general hygiene and prepared meals. I kept her active and engaged her at home and during recreational outings. I also transported her to summer school. I also did the same type of work with a 7-year-old boy with autism for a few hours a week over the summer of 2011. During my junior and senior year of high school, I worked in the C.I. classroom where I helped the students in class with tests or worksheets that were given. I also played board games with them, colored, and I was responsible for two students in the weight room. I volunteer at an organization where I provide a friendship with special needs children through play and learning programs. I have been paired up with children from various ages from 3-16. I have most experience in this program with children under 10. I volunteered at a summer camp where I was a counselor for children with special needs from ages 10-18. I ensured their safety and provided an environment where they could have a good time. I am passionate about working with children because I know I have the ability to teach them when other people can't. I possess the patience and desire to make sure they have a great time and still be safe. When I succeed and I see their faces light up with joy, it brings happiness to my heart.

Dog Sitter Available For Daily Walks, Dog Park Excursions, And In-home Care! — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I've grown up always having a family dog, and have now had my own Australian shepherd for 6 years. I frequently take care of 3 dogs when their owner is away on business, so handling more than one pet at a time is no issue. I have been asked to pet-sit for friends and former employers in the past multiple times, and have been hired through care. com on two puppy-sitting gigs that I loved. I now work for a professional, licensed pet care company, but am looking to fill out my schedule a bit more for the summer. I'm happy to walk pets or take them to the dog park, whatever is needed!

Why TIVA? 
Local Locums®We find the perfect assignments for our clinicians in cities and states across the country, or as local locums — locum tenens positions in a clinician’s home location.
Lots of Locums JobsThrough our nationwide network of clients, we find the perfect jobs for our clinicians — pediatric, anesthesiology, emergency medicine, hospitalist, and CRNA, to name a few.
Always Accessible
Our consultants are always available as an advocate for our physicians and CRNAs at a moment’s notice. TIVA ensures a high-touch customer service to find the right locum tenens job.

Specialty-Specific ExperienceTIVA Healthcare search consultants have many years of experience as advocates for the successful placement of our clinicians. They use their experience to expertly place highly-qualified clinicians in the right jobs for seamless integration with clients’ patient care teams.
CredentialingBy performing and verifying your credentials ourselves, we ensure the placement process is efficient and seamless. That means we can find your ideal placement in less time.
We’re Your AdvocatesAt TIVA, we’re passionate about helping clinicians make the most of each assignment opportunity. We work hard to provide everything you’re looking for — freedom, flexibility, work-life balance, career growth, and personal fulfillment — while doing everything from maximizing compensation to arranging travel and housing.
Your Own ConsultantA personal consultant has a one-on-one conversation with you to learn about your professional and personal goals. We then create a customized list of healthcare facilities to target for you, and work closely with you to streamline the search process.
A Personal ApproachWe know how to market your strengths and skills to secure you better opportunities, and we coach you on how to improve your CV and interview techniques. Whether you’re looking for local locum shifts or an assignment across the country, we know how to move your name to the top of the candidate list and connect you directly to key decision-makers.
The Care to Follow UpDuring and after the assignment, your consultant regularly keeps in touch with you to make sure you are satisfied. We will discuss possibilities for an extension and/or additional locum tenens opportunities that we feel are a fit. From start to finish, we keep the focus on you and your best interests.

“I feel special when I work with TIVA. They provide very individual attention and are always available to assist me.”

Contact Us

Why TIVA?On-Demand SolutionsTIVA provides on-demand placement and personalized, high-touch service to help fill even the most challenging of staffing needs with a sense of urgency and efficiency. We place the most qualified candidates where and when they are needed and whether the need is short or long term.
Local Locums℠ Clinicians filling locum tenens positions in their home location bring a deep, natural understanding of the community being served — providing tremendous value to our clients’ patients and their families. TIVA Healthcare’s Local Locums℠  program ensures we have a TIVA-certified candidate in your area ready to step into your facility and care for your patients.
Personalized ServiceOne TIVA consultant, well-versed in your business and industry, speaks one-on-one with you to gather the most information about your practice, company culture, location, and, most importantly, your vision of an ideal candidate. This better allows us to sift through clinicians and hone in on the best person for the open position.
Collaborative PartnershipBuilding upon 15 years of expertise in healthcare staffing, we are committed to providing excellent service to meet our clients’ staffing needs — including helping clients fulfill their financial, safety, and patient care goals.
Specialty-Specific InsightYour dedicated TIVA consultant will possess deep insight into the areas of specialized (and sub-specialized) care that you need staffed. Our expert approach to staffing includes strong collaboration, research and intuition.
Efficient ResponsivenessTIVA’s expertise allows us to be nimble, and clients can connect with their unique TIVA consultant at any time. We deliver a few well-chosen clinicians – instead of a mass of resumes. Our effectiveness is evident in our very low turnover rate. Simply put, we do our job right — and efficiently — the first time.
In-House CredentialingTIVA Healthcare offers complete verifications on all locum tenens clinicians. By credentialing and verifying clinicians, we speed the placement process, giving our clients immediate service and cost efficiency.
Proactive OutreachTIVA consultants speak to hundreds of clinicians daily, building personal relationships, and broadening our network of eligible candidates. We make it our business to attend every national healthcare conference to conduct in-person interviews with top clinicians we envision matching our clients’ staffing needs.
Open CommunicationTIVA is committed to providing open, ongoing dialogue that keeps pace with our clients’ needs. We discuss our clinicians’ qualifications and fit with the facility. We also check in regularly to make sure the clinician is performing as expected. We act as a mediator if our client has any issues with the clinician and will immediately work to find a replacement if there is any dissatisfaction.

“TIVA is always reliable in providing the clinicians we need. We selected TIVA as a partner because they were very easy to work with.”
Dr. R.
