Bell, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CEO, President and Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. We have had a very business start to the year, driven by early stage setup and deployment activities with new customers, additional wins in the U.S. and internationally, and the continued ramp-up of our innovative Gen5 solutions.Q1 was a solid quarter for deployments. We delivered more than 511,000 endpoints, bringing our cumulative delivered endpoints to more than 26 million. And we generated positive operating cash flow, ending the period with $116.6 million of net cash.Read MoreBefore going through some of our key customer wins, I would like to address our billings and profitability in the quarter. As we expected, the start of a number of new customer projects partly offset the anticipated decline from our top customer of 2016, which is in the later stages of its multiyear deployment. While our billings were within the guided range, the profitability was lower than anticipated. This was caused by a higher mix of projects with lower-margin hardware content combined with a delay in several high-margin projects, which pushed billings and profitability from the first quarter into future periods.Finally, our operating expenses were impacted by some onetime items, and we have not yet benefited from our announced restructuring.Looking out at the year, we have good visibility for ongoing projects, major new customer starts and our managed services and SaaS business. This is offset by 2 factors. First, one of our suppliers had a factory fire in late April, which could impact some of our shipments later in the year. And second, we have a somewhat lower expectation around future book and bill business for the year.With this in mind, we are adjusting our outlook for the year. We now expect our full year 2017 billings to be in the range of flat to up approximately 5% versus last year. In addition, we are accelerating the restructuring efforts, which we disclosed earlier this year, to better align our cost structure with our anticipated business levels.Our top priority is to execute on our key growth initiatives in our core smart grid, smart city and industrial IoT markets. This means a swift ramp of Gen5 at our major new customer deployments, and a sharpened focus on international opportunities, leveraging our new geographic organizational structure, where we are locating employees in the regions closer to our customers around the world at a lower cost.We are also focused on innovation to bring the battery-powered Milli 5 and new applications to our core smart utility and smart city markets and new verticals.I will now move on to some recent highlights around the quarter. More than 35% of billings in the quarter were from projects which we consider new or which contributed little to no billings in the year-ago period. The largest was Con Edison, which became our top billings customer in Q1 and is moving forward with its multiyear deployment of more than 5 million electric and gas connections across its New York service territories. We also had meaningful billings from early-stage programs at AEP Ohio, PacifiCorp, Entergy and CESC of India.Overall, I am pleased with the performance of our teams and their ability to ramp these and other new customers as we work to convert our billion-dollar-plus backlog entering the year, into large-scale deployments in billings.Now on to our customer announcements and other developments. First, we are thrilled to announce that Florida Power & Light Company is further extending its smart grid investment with additional endpoints and expanded distribution automation. FP&L is a great customer, with more than 4.9 million homes and businesses connected. They continue to leverage the Silver Spring multi-application platform for additional solutions, including DA, advanced security and Streetlights. Today, we are happy to report bookings for 370,000 additional endpoints to support anticipated growth in FP&L's connected homes and businesses, and a DA expansion to further support FP&L's reliability goals.Next, we have been awarded additional deployments in Mexico from CFE. As a follow-on to our 140,000 device award for Mexico City's Central region, today we announced an award to connect approximately 92,000 additional AMI devices in Mexico City's Southern District. Similar to our earlier award, our technology will be integrated into cabinet subsystems provided by Tecnologías EOS, a local partner in the region.We are also formally announcing an award for approximately 71,000 AMI devices in Southeast Mexico, which we had mentioned on our earnings call for the second quarter of 2016. These projects are expected to help improve revenue protection, reliability and energy management.We are also proud to announce that we have been selected by the Golden Valley Electric Association, a cooperative in Alaska, to connect approximately 50,000 homes and businesses in its service territory. GVEA plans to deploy Silver Spring's multi-application iPv6 platform to support its AMI program to its member owners and communities beginning this summer. The deployment is intended to help modernize its grid infrastructure, improve reliability, increase operational efficiencies and enable its members to better manage their energy use.We also have another positive development for our smart city and IoT platform. We are excited to report that the City of Chicago has selected Silver Spring Networks as a technology subcontractor for the city's smart lighting modernization project. This project demonstrates good traction from our recently announced smart city and IoT reseller agreement with Ameresco, which is serving as the prime contractor for this project. The Chicago City Council approved the project scope and funding a few weeks ago, and we expect to contract with Ameresco later this year. The 4-year project is believed to be the largest city-led wireless smart street light program in the U.S., with more than 250,000 connected lights as part of the city's upgrade to LED lights.Chicago intends to use Silver Spring's network and data platform to remotely monitor and control the lights. The City of Chicago will own and operate the network, supported by Silver Spring's managed services and SaaS environment.I now want to say a few words about a significant milestone for us, the upcoming introduction of our expanded developer program, which we plan to roll out at the IoT World 2017 Conference in Santa Clara next week. We have significantly enhanced the tools and support for the developer community, which we hope will accelerate the adoption of our IoT technology for additional use cases in our core smart grid and smart city markets, as well as new industrial verticals.Some of the key enhancements include a new developer portal for improved access to our support, a hardware developer kit for Arduino to simplify the integration of the Milli 5 into new devices, the IoT edge router dev addition, which enables connectivity for additional devices to our platform, and Starfish Studio, a software simulator to speed application development. We have already seen interest from our utility customers, many of which are actively investigating other potential applications to further leverage their multi-application IoT communications platform.To close, I remain confident in Silver Spring's potential for growth in the smart grid, smart city and broader industrial IoT opportunity. We have a significant backlog with some of the most respected companies in the world, and we will continue to focus on the Gen5 rollout supporting large-scale customer deployments. We are investing in the new products and applications to further leverage our footprint of more than 26 million homes and businesses and drive growth in our managed services and SaaS business. We are winning additional business with new awards in the U.S. and international markets through our geographic sales organization. And we remain committed to our mission to securely and reliably connect the things that matter to the Internet of important things.With that, I'm now happy to introduce you to Catriona Fallon, our new CFO, who joined us on March 27. Catriona brings more than 20 years of finance, investor relations, corporate strategy and business development experience to her role. Most recently, Catriona was the CFO of Marin Software. She has also held several leadership positions at Cognizant and Hewlett-Packard. Earlier in her career, she gained experience on Wall Street as an equity analyst and as a management consultant at McKinsey.We are thrilled to welcome Catriona to the Silver Spring team, and have already begun to benefit from her presence.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here. I also want to thank Ken Gianella for his contributions to the team, and I'm happy that he is remaining as my Senior VP of Finance.Before I dig into our first quarter results and outlook, I'd like to provide you with some of my observations from my first 40 days as CFO here at Silver Spring Networks.I joined the company because of the tremendous opportunity and Silver Spring's vision of leveraging its strong market position with leading utilities into international markets and new industrial verticals. I've spent the first month getting to know my team members within the organization, familiarizing myself with our technology, learning about the primary business drivers, and digging into our financial model. Silver Spring has a strong pipeline of potential opportunities ahead, including major new customers, new products, growth geographies and IoT innovation.These strategic investments, however, can take time to pay off. My first priorities have been to assess our outlook for 2017, establish a plan to better align our expense structure to deliver the profitability and cash flow expected for a company of our size, and drive a disciplined investment approach to support my key growth initiatives while staying within our expense envelope.Now let's begin with the high level comments on the quarter. GAAP revenue was $50.3 million, and in line with our expectations. Billings were $68 million, down slightly from last year, with the decline from our largest customer in 2016 somewhat offset by a ramp of several newer customers. Total cost of billings was $39.4 million or 58% of billings.Profitability of our billings was impacted by 2 main factors. First, the product mix was skewed towards lower-margin hardware content in the quarter, including managed appliances and back office equipment for the installation of new managed services and SaaS environments.Second, and the reason this was somewhat a surprise to us, was that we saw some late quarter pushouts of professional services billings. Essentially, we incurred the cost for these services during the quarter, but the billings are delayed, pending milestone achievement, which we expect in future periods.As we look out to the rest of 2017 and beyond, there are clearly opportunities to improve the cost of billings, particularly in achieving the scale and cost efficiencies on our Gen5, and also in improving the utilization and ability to bill in-period for our professional services.From an operating perspective, non-GAAP operating expense was $35 million. This was higher than we had planned, partially due to onetime marketing and G&A expenses. Clearly, as a company, we need to be more efficient. The executive team and I have been spending a lot of time scrutinizing our operating expense structure and executing on the restructuring that we announced on March 10. Given the timing, however, there were few savings in Q1. We are committed to getting the expense structure back on track and establishing a sustainable level of profitability going forward.Now on to the details from our first quarter results. Product billings, including hardware and software, were $42.6 million in the quarter, down approximately 7% year-over-year due to fewer endpoint deliveries from Q1 of last year. We delivered approximately 511,000 network endpoints in the quarter for a total of 26 million cumulative electric network endpoints. Product cost of billings was $23.5 million or 55% of product billings. Profitability versus the year-ago period was impacted by a lower mix of NICs and a higher mix of hardware appliances. Professional services billings were $9.4 million, down 8% year-over-year. Professional services cost of billings was $6.8 million or 72.2%.Managed services and SaaS billings were $15.9 million, up approximately 23% year-over-year, due to growth in our installed base and contribution from newer customers. Managed services and SaaS cost of billings were $9.2 million or 57.6%.Advanced Meter Infrastructure billings were $53.7 million, down approximately 7% year-over-year due to a lower endpoint shipments versus a year ago. We are pleased to see new solutions billings up 25% year-over-year to $14.3 million. This was driven by new distribution automation projects, smart city and Operations Optimizer, demonstrating success in deploying additional applications into our customer footprint.From a geographic perspective, international billings were approximately 15% of the total for the quarter, or $10 million. When we look at the pipeline and the projects coming in through 2017 and beyond, we see good traction in our APAC and EMEA regions and expect to have more wins there over time.And a few housekeeping items, GAAP tax expense was approximately $600,000, and other income was approximately $500,000. Basic share count was approximately 52.6 million shares; net cash was $116.6 million at the end of the period, down approximately $1.6 million from last quarter, due to the timing of payments. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 million. Capital expenditures were approximately $1 million, and depreciation was approximately $2.2 million. We feel very good about the pipeline of deployments and new customers that we see ahead of us in 2017 and our focus on execution of the historical deals that we booked in 2016 and in previous years.As we look to the full year of 2017, I want to highlight the $600 million plus in bookings that we closed in 2016, as well as a strong pipeline of opportunities for the year ahead. That said, we also want to provide some flexibility to the year around the timing of billings and take into consideration the potential supply chain shortage resulting from the late April factory fire at one of our suppliers that could impact supply of our gas product.Any resulting lumpiness in our billings can have an impact on the linearity of our profitability. This makes management of our operating expenses all the more important, and why you will continue to see us sharpen our pencils on efficiencies before increasing our investments.For our second quarter of 2017, we expect GAAP revenue of approximately $45 million to $50 million; billings of approximately $68 million to $72 million; cost of billings of approximately 56% to 58% of billings; non-GAAP operating expense of approximately $32 million to $33 million, reflecting early benefits from our restructuring; GAAP tax and other expense of approximately $1 million; and a basic and fully diluted share count of approximately 53 million and 55 million shares, respectively.For the full year 2017, we expect GAAP revenue of approximately $350 million to $370 million. This updated outlook reflects more flexibility for the timing of customer acceptances and the associated drawdown of their deferred revenue balances for the remainder of the year. I also want to note that any one specific customer may have a significant impact on our GAAP revenue for a given period.As Mike mentioned, we expect full year billings to be approximately flat to up 5% for the year. Our revised outlook factors in our Q1 performance and our expectation of continued solid execution of our new customer starts into the second half of the year, with a somewhat lower expectation around future book and bill business and shipments of gas products potentially impacted by the factory fire at one of our suppliers.We expect cost of billings to be in the high 50s as a percentage of billings. We expect to manage our non-GAAP operating expense to approximately $127 million to $130 million, with the restructuring benefits increasing as we go throughout the year. We expect GAAP tax and other expense of approximately $2 million, basic and fully diluted share count of approximately 53 million and 55 million shares, respectively; and we expect net capital expenditures of approximately $5 million to $10 million.We're putting the pieces in place for sustainable and profitable growth. That will require making the tradeoffs so that our investments are prefunded by efficiencies. I will be keenly managing our operating expenses and squeezing out inefficiencies across the company. This level of discipline will allow us to invest in innovation around both our core and our higher growth IoT markets that we can continue to win and shape the market in IoT.Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Mark for questions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mark McKechnie, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - VP of IR [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Catriona. Operator, we'll take our first question.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Noah Duke Kaye, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - Executive Director and Senior Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona, welcome aboard.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Great to be here.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Noah Duke Kaye, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - Executive Director and Senior Analyst [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So first, can we start with understanding the moving parts of lowering the revenue guidance in a little bit more detail? I guess, it's about $10 million to $15 million lower at the midpoint. Maybe I don't have that right. Maybe it's $8 million lower at the midpoint. But I figured it’d be helpful to understand, how much of that is bookings shipped, versus this impact from the fire? And maybe, if you could explain why instead the book and ship business is trending lower?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Sure. Sure. So thanks, Noah. Good to meet you. I wanted to start off by saying as we look at the full year, we wanted to take our Q1 performance into consideration. And we're feeling good about our expectations for how the new customer programs are going to ramp up over the course of the year. But also, I want to take a prudent approach to how we're looking at billings over the course of the year and certainly putting fresh eyes on it. There's some impact from the factory fire, and I think we are looking to remedy that. We are certainly looking at other suppliers that we already work with, and just to make sure that we can satisfy the demands that we have in the market. But we're taking those 3 things into consideration. And in terms of visibility, we certainly have high visibility for the year in terms of deployments that are coming from our backlog. This is both the ongoing billings and customers that we've had from last year, as well as the new starts. And it also takes into consideration the largest customer that we had last year, ComEd, was 36% of our billings in Q1 a year ago. And that is scaling down over the course of the year. It's now still a 10% customer, but it is scaling down. And we've largely replaced that with a number of other significant customers that are starting to ramping up over the course of the year. We also have good visibility in terms of the primarily recurring revenue, which is the managed services and the SaaS business. We still expect that to grow double digits this year. But we are, again, taking a look at the book and bill, and we have a very good detailed view and process on how we're managing that business. One other thing to think about though, too, is as we look at the course of the year, we benefited in the past from some nice significant software deals that come in. And given the unpredictability of the timing of that, I'm taking a more prudent approach in terms of how we model that into the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Noah Duke Kaye, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - Executive Director and Senior Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So then, maybe just a follow-up, specifically on the book and ship, this is for the whole team, I mean, are you seeing any specific reason why book and ship is trending a bit lower? Is there anything in the environment? Any kind of delays on spending decisions that you might attribute this to?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No. I'd say there's actually no -- no real change in the view. I'd say certainly, given what we saw in the last week of the quarter, really, the last week of Q1, was that some of the things that we were expecting to actually bill in Q1 got pushed out. And so I see that happening, and I want to make sure that I take that impact into consideration. And these weren't deals that we lost or these weren't customers that went away, they were literally billings that got pushed to later periods, and I just want to be prudent about that kind of impact. And we're really just giving ourselves a little bit more flexibility on the timing of the billings for the year. But in terms of the pipeline, there's no change to the pipeline. There's still a lot of -- some, specifically, some international business that is looking intriguing over the course of the year. And yes, doing good.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Your next question is coming from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pavel S. Molchanov, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Energy Analyst [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to the team. So let me ask kind of a classic CFO question. Your near-term growth, obviously, a little bit on the low side, but you have over $100 million of cash on the balance sheet, and you've been building cash essentially every quarter. What's the kind of the outlook for M&A, adding some assets, particularly on the software side to kind of bulk up the near-term organic growth picture?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Bell, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CEO, President and Director [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's Mike. I'll take that one. Yes, we -- I like having that war chest. We are always -- we are very opportunistic about that. We are always looking for tuck-ins like we did with Detectent and SLV. I would -- I, personally, particularly like software, where we can get more recurring revenue as opposed to more hardware revenue. I like stuff that's both -- that either we could sell through our existing customers or something that could accelerate us more into IoT verticals. So I'll kind of leave it there. We are certainly open to finding ways to increase our reoccurring revenue quickly by finding something that really meshes with what we're doing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pavel S. Molchanov, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Energy Analyst [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And you've given some color on kind of the pace at which ComEd is becoming a smaller component of the revenue mix. Can you also do that for your Con Ed, the New York City contract? I don't know, maybe how much of that is expected to come in the second half of 2017?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So yes. So I'll jump in here, and Mike might have additional comments. But -- so Con Ed is one of our newer customers, and we expect to continue to see this ramp. It was a greater than 10% customer in the quarter. And I expect it to continue to ramp up over the course of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from Carter Driscoll from FBR.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carter William Driscoll, FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division - Analyst [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Could you talk about, I mean -- you mentioned Ameresco is your partner in Chicago. They talked about other potential large smart city deployments in continental U.S. Could you comment on some of the activity there and your expectation of either working with them and then, some of the cities it's more of a straight lighting swap out, but if it has intelligence, if you could kind of compare and contrast maybe some of the larger opportunities you've seen in the U.S., maybe near term or over the medium term?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Bell, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CEO, President and Director [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I mean, yes. So we have Ameresco is a great partner of ours. We have, definitely instituted a channel strategy in terms of lighting. We think lighting is a gigantic opportunity. We've partnered with some of the biggest names in that space, Ameresco in Europe, we have Evesa in urban controls that have also gotten us some good wins. We think there's a large opportunity in lighting. The nice thing for us is when you go into an area with lighting with our technology, you get this lighting canopy and people are thrilled that it works as well as it works. And then, they realize, it can be used everything else, like metering, and other smart city activities, and environmental monitoring. So it's sort of a Trojan horse for us. It's a great business. It works really well. The customer's happy. And it then gives them an IoT canopy that they can use for other things. So we're actually seeing this great benefit, where we're seeing original AMI customers who want to branch out and do things like lighting and we're seeing lighting customers who once they get the lighting canopy in, are thinking about doing other things with that -- their canopy. So we're seeing customers approaching the use cases kind of from both ends of the spectrum.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carter William Driscoll, FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division - Analyst [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And then, just as a follow-up, any near-term opportunities outside Chicago of a similar type of magnitude that are on the radar screen?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Bell, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CEO, President and Director [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I mean, not that we could talk about, to be honest with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from Alex Kurtz from Pacific Crest Securities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Alexander Kurtz, Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst, Enterprise Infrastructure [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just going back to your guidance for the year for billings and thinking about the sequential growth rates. As that relates to the backlog visibility, can you talk about the confidence in sort of that Q3 to Q4 move that's going to be required to sort of get to the midpoint of your guidance? And then, my second question is just looking at consensus estimates for next year that's implying, obviously, before this call, growth. Is there anything changed from a visibility perspective, Catriona, that would make you think, that might be more on the aggressive side, based on some of the changes and professional service delays that you've seen, and maybe we should be rethinking '18 billings?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So thanks, Alex, for the question. I'll take the first question first, which is about the sequential growth into the back half of the year. The first half of this year is really about getting the significant customers up and running. And we're also looking into what that means in terms of the mix of products that we are shipping. And certainly, what we saw in Q1 was that it was more of the lower-margin hardware to begin with. We expect more of the better margin mix to be deployed in the latter half of the year. So I feel good about the ramp. The ramp of the billings coming into the second half. In terms of 2018, I'm really focused on 2017 right now. I think we have a -- we do have a very strong pipeline for bookings. And so I feel really good about our opportunity there. But right now I'm focused on making sure that we deliver in 2017, that we execute on the billings that we have in the plan, and that we get some costs out of the business to improve the profitability.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Alexander Kurtz, Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst, Enterprise Infrastructure [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Just trying to understand if growth is still an opportunity for '18 or if it's too soon to know.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So I mean, I'm giving you 2017 guidance, to be honest. And I think we can talk about the outlook for 2018 a little bit closer to the end of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from Matt Robison from Wunderlich Securities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Peter on for Matt. Just wondering with the CFE customer in Mexico, what does your guys -- what kind of ramp do you guys see with them? And what's the time frame for that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mexico?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Bell, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CEO, President and Director [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Mexico. Yes. So what is the time frame for that. So this would be the second -- as you know, the second one we had in Mexico, we are working on the deployment schedule as we speak. It is in line -- it's factored into our numbers that we had planned on. It's on track. I couldn't give you the exact time frame off the top of my head, to be completely honest. But it's part of our normal course of business.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And then, one other quick question. Have you guys -- you mentioned a few projects that slipped from this quarter. Have you guys seen anything that was pulled forward or expedited during the quarter?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So there's always some puts and takes at the end of the quarter. There's always some moving parts, some things that we are able to bill and some things that push out to the next quarter. I think it was nothing unlike previous quarters. So, yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from Cindy Motz from Williams Capital Group.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cynthia Michelle Motz, The Williams Capital Group, L.P., Research Division - Analyst [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just wanted to ask a follow-up on that last question -- or one of the questions before about revenues. So in the latter part of the year then, we should see -- or even the next quarter, a bump from revenues from the delays that we saw first quarter. Is that correct? And then -- go on.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So yes, so what we saw in Q1 was largely the professional services being pushed out to subsequent periods. Some of those billings, however, will be in milestones that we'll see in Q3, not in Q2. Just based on some timings associated with that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cynthia Michelle Motz, The Williams Capital Group, L.P., Research Division - Analyst [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. But you do feel like -- so you are going to need to see -- even to make like, let's say flat, like or and the 5%, you do feel comfortable that third quarter, fourth quarter can ramp like -- that would be like that range?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cynthia Michelle Motz, The Williams Capital Group, L.P., Research Division - Analyst [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And what about gross margins?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. I think you -- yes, absolutely. So just in terms of the back half of the year and the visibility, yes, we've taken a more prudent approach in terms of our expectations around the bookings that we are able to bill in the year. And that's given essentially the timing of milestones and the timing of shipments. But we do have good visibility into the back half of the year. Again, we need to execute, so that's a big focus. And then, in terms of the margins, so we are kind of adjusting the way we are speaking about gross margin. And it's high 50s, basically, in terms of the cost of billings. And I think the way to think about that is there could be software deals that we're able to bill for. And in past, we've had good benefit on the cost of billings side when we ship a lot of software. So I'm not assuming a lot of that. Essentially, I'm trying to set a level that we can meet on a consistent basis in terms of the cost of billings. And again, if there's upside, it's due to a nice mix of the product that we're shipping. In the past, again, we've benefited from both software, high NIC content, high analytics content. And if we see any of those things, then we'd have a nice benefit.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cynthia Michelle Motz, The Williams Capital Group, L.P., Research Division - Analyst [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. But you think it's going to run around maybe 57% at the midrange like throughout the rest of the year, the cost of billings, or...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's in the high-50s. Yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question today is coming from David Katter from Baird.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Francis Katter, Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Junior Analyst [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was hoping you can provide a little more color on restructuring initiatives. I think, if I heard correctly, you announced accelerated restructuring or you talked about that. When can we start to see benefits from that? And what are some of the initiatives you're considering?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So absolutely. Thanks, David. Certainly, one of my key priorities, and something I'm taking action on immediately, is getting the cost structure right for our current business levels. And the company had announced a restructuring back on March 10. Some of the things included in that are realignment of our resources, of our headcount, there's some facility efficiencies in there. And in terms of when you'll start to see that, we've already taken some steps so you should see some benefit from that in Q2. So outside of direct employee cost, we also have a large amount of contractor-based cost, and those are some of the things that you can move faster on. So we are looking at reducing our contractor cost, and then, we're also looking at things like T&E. That's another expense that you can adjust in the near term. So this was taken into consideration in our guidance expectations for Q2 in terms of OpEx. So you'll see us get a couple of million dollars out of the run rate in Q2, and then, we expect to see continued benefit from the restructuring as we go throughout the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Francis Katter, Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Junior Analyst [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And maybe one more if -- and then I'll hop in queue. I was hoping to dig in a little more on the margins. And I know that you're being conservative for 2017, but as we look into out years, do you see software contributing to lower cost of billings over time? Or should we think about this as the new normal?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So we didn't really speak about 2018. I'm getting the fact that a lot of people want to talk about 2018. There's lots of opportunity in terms of different deployments and getting customers up and running and shipments of the higher-margin products, as well as software. So what I'm seeing is a number of new customer starts this year, and those should have nice deployments on some of the networking equipment in the out years. Again, we'll talk more about the outlook for 2018 as we get a little bit closer. But I'm feeling good about what I'm seeing in the business today.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Bell, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CEO, President and Director [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'd also just add that we've been pretty successful at selling up customers. Once we get the customers up and running, we've been pretty successful at selling up some advance security software features and our Operations Optimizer software. So there's certainly opportunity there to, I think, as we've been -- as customers get -- ramp to scale and get everything up and running, and we show them the value. We've been pretty successful in doing incremental add-ons.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Let's turn the floor back over to Mark for any further closing comments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mark McKechnie, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - VP of IR [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, everyone, for joining the call, and we look forward to being in touch with folks throughout the quarter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Catriona M. Fallon, Silver Spring Networks, Inc. - CFO [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [48]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.
