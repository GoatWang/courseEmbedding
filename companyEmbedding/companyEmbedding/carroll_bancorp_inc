Corporate Profile
Carroll Bancrop, Inc. (OTCBB: CROL)
October 2012
 Carroll Bancorp, Inc. Announces Third Quarter Results
SYKESVILLE, MD – October 16, 2012 – Carroll Bancorp, Inc. (OTCBB: CROL), the parent company of Carroll Community Bank (the “Bank”), today announced net income of $39,000 or $0.11 per common share for the three months ended and net income of $2,000 or $0.01 per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.  By comparison, the Company recorded net income of $28,000 and $73,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.
The increase in net income for the three months ending September 30, 2012 compared to September 30, 2011 was primarily due to the higher loan balances in the 2012 period as the Bank continues to leverage its balance sheet along with a reduction in the provision for loan losses and real estate owned expenses and losses.  These items were partially offset by gains on sale of securities realized during the 2011 period.
“We are pleased with our progress in the third quarter and the improvement in our core earnings.  The loan growth we experienced in the second and third quarters leveraged our balance sheet and has had a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin.” stated Russell J. Grimes, President and CEO of Carroll Bancorp, Inc.
Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2012 decreased by $377,000, or 45%, to $464,000 and total nonperforming assets decreased by $771,000, or 35%, to $1.4 million compared to June 30, 2012.  Compared to September 30, 2011, nonperforming loans declined slightly and nonperforming assets decreased by $678,000, or 32%.  The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.65% and 0.79%, at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively and the ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets was 1.45% and 2.21%, at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  In addition, past due loans greater than 30 days to total assets declined to 1.24% at September 30, 2012 compared to 1.36% at June 30, 2012 and to 1.98% at September 30, 2011.  Loans 90 days or more past due are considered nonperforming loans.
“We continue to make significant progress on the workout of our nonperforming loans and assets.  Our asset quality ratios reflect our diligence in resolving problem assets and we expect this will have a positive impact on our future performance.” added Mr. Grimes.
Carroll Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board (www.otcbb.com) under the symbol “CROL.”  For more information, visit our website at www.carrollcobank.com or contact Russell Grimes, President & CEO at 410-795-1900.
