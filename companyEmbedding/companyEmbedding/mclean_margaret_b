Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1893 edition. Language: English. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Harper & brothers 228 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 452290397

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Hardcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1893 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This hardcover book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of hardcover binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal hardcovers. This book is printed on demand on acid-free paper. Original Publisher: New York : Harper & brothers 238 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # HB452298938

Item Description: Cfm Publications, United States, 2013. Paperback. Book Condition: New. 4th. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.This fourth edition of Essentials of Jamaican Taxation as with earlier editions covers the material for an undergraduate course in Jamaican taxation and deals with the theory of taxation and its application through the main provisions of the Income Tax Act, the various Acts governing payroll taxes, the General Consumption Tax Act and the Contractors Levy Act. This edition covers changes which took place after 2007 including the main provisions in the 2012 budget. The text is designed to give mainly students of accounting a working knowledge of taxation as it is administered in Jamaica so they are equipped to perform computations of tax payable by businesses/employers, employees, self-employed, and persons with income from sources other than employment. Most of the text should be understood quite readily by readers other than students who wish to be informed on taxation matters.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9789768053206
