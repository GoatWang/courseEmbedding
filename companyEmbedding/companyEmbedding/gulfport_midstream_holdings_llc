Gulfport and Rice form Utica midstream JV in Ohio








October 8, 2015



































Gulfport Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: GPOR) has executed a letter of intent (the agreement) with Rice Midstream Holdings LLC (Rice), a wholly owned subsidiary of Rice Energy Inc. (NYSE: RICE), to form a midstream joint venture (JV) to develop natural gas gathering and water services assets to support Gulfport’s dry gas Utica shale development in eastern Belmont and Monroe counties, Ohio. The JV will be supported by long-term, fee-based service agreements with Gulfport.
Gulfport will own 25% of the JV and Rice will own the remaining 75% of the JV. Rice will be responsible for constructing and operating the JV’s assets:

A dry gas gathering system with capacity to gather over 1.8 MMDth/d of natural gas consisting of 165 miles of high- and low-pressure 12-in. to 30-in. gathering pipelines with multiple interconnections to interstate pipelines including Rockies Express, ET Rover, TETCO, and Dominion East Ohio  
Approximately 50,000 horsepower of compression for gathering and delivery into various downstream interstate pipelines  
A freshwater distribution system designed to deliver fresh water to pads for completion activities

Under the terms of the agreement, Gulfport will dedicate approximately 77,000 leasehold acres, including the acreage recently acquired in its Paloma Partners III LLC and American Energy – Utica LLC transactions. In addition, Gulfport will also contribute to the JV an existing 11-mile gas gathering pipeline and a 350-MDth/d TETCO interconnect, which are both located in Monroe County.

Rice Energy Inc. (RICE) said Oct. 8 it has entered an Utica Shale midstream joint venture (JV) in Ohio with Gulfport Energy Corp. (GPOR).The Canonsburg, Pa. company's subsidiary, Rice Midstream Holdings LLC, has signed an agreement with Gulfport for the JV worth about $640 million.The partnership plans to develop natural gas gathering and water services assets to support Gulfport's dry gas Utica Shale development in eastern Belmont County and Monroe County, Ohio.Oklahoma City's Gulfport will dedicate about 77,000 leasehold acres to the JV. This includes acreage recently acquired in its Paloma Partners III LLC and America Energy - Utica LLC transactions.Rice will own 75% of the JV and be responsible for constructing and operating the assets. Gulfport will own the remaining interest.Rice and Gulfport plan to invest about $520 million to develop gathering and compression assets and $120 million for water assets within the JV over the next six years. Each partner will fund its proportionate share of the total capital investments.The JV will include:A dry gas gathering system with capacity to gather over 1.8 million dekatherms per day of natural gas consisting of about 165 miles of high and low pressure 12- to 30-inch gathering pipelines with multiple interconnections to interstate pipelines (includes Rockies Express, ET Rover, TETCO and Dominion East Ohio);About 50,000 horsepower of compression for gathering and delivery into various downstream interstate pipelines; andA fresh water distribution system designed to deliver fresh water to pads for completion activities.In addition, Gulfport will also contribute an existing 11-mile gas gathering pipeline and a TETCO interconnect, which are both located in Monroe County.The JV significantly increases Rice's leading midstream position in the core of the Utica Shale. By leveraging its existing footprint, Rice said it's able to grow its third-party business and expand its relationship with Gulfport across Gulfport's premier position in the prolific dry gas Utica Shale."This joint venture will be one of the premier midstream systems in the prolific dry gas core of the Utica and adds to Rice's attractive inventory of potential drop down candidates to Rice Midstream Partners," said Daniel J. Rice IV, CEO, in a statement.Rice and Gulfport plan to pursue third-party gas gathering and water services opportunities within a 340,000-acre area of mutual interest that will cover portions of Belmont and Monroe counties, Ohio.The JV will be supported by long-term, fee-based service agreements with Gulfport. Initial construction of the system is expected to begin immediately and first deliveries are planned for the middle of 2016.

Babst  Calland: Rice and Gulfport Enter Into Midstream Joint Venture in Utica Shale
 
By Brittany A. Roof
As reported by Oil and Gas Investor, Rice Midstream Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Rice Energy Inc., and Gulfport Energy Corporation have teamed up to build a pipeline gathering and water line system in Ohio’s Utica Shale. Over the next six years, the companies plan to spend a combined $640 million on 165 miles of pipeline that will connect Gulfport’s Utica shale wells in Belmont and Monroe Counties to interstate pipelines. Speaking of the joint venture, Rice’s CEO, Daniel J. Rice IV, stated: “This joint venture will be one of the premier midstream systems in the prolific dry gas core of the Utica…” Gulfport will dedicate about 77,000 leasehold acres and an existing 11-mile pipeline to the joint venture, and Rice will be responsible for constructing and operating the assets. The parties have further agreed that Rice will own 75% of the joint venture and Gulfport will own the remaining 25%. Each partner will be responsible for its proportionate share of costs.

22
 





 


 


connection with any
Business Opportunity that is not a Restricted Project or an
Additional Project (other than Additional Projects that are pursued
by a Member or its Affiliates pursuant to Section 3.3(f) )
(a “ Renounced Business Opportunity ”),
whether arising in common law or equity or created by rule of law,
statute, constitution, contract (including this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document) or otherwise, are expressly released
and waived by the Company and each Member, in each case to the

claim for such actual damages had they been caused by an
Independent Third Party who did not owe any duties to the Company
or its Members in respect of Business Opportunities.

(e)     
Pursuit of
Additional Projects through the Company . Either Rice or Gulfport (in each

provide other related services or (ii) to provide applicable Water
Services, in each case with respect to natural gas wells located
outside (or both inside and outside) of the Area of Mutual Interest
(an “ Additional Project ”), and if the
pursuit of such Additional Project through the Company is approved
pursuant to Section 6.12(h) (it being understood that, for
the purposes of obtaining such approval, all Managers designated by
the Member proposing such Additional Project shall be deemed to
have voted in favor of pursuing such Additional Project through the
Company), then such Additional Project shall be pursued by the
Company; provided that the pursuit of any such Additional
Project by the Company shall not expand the Area of Mutual Interest
or the Primary Business. If such an Additional Project is so
presented to the Company by Rice or Gulfport but its pursuit
through the Company is not so approved, then the Member so
presenting such Additional Project may pursue such project outside
of the Company in accordance with this Article 3 and shall,
in its discretion, be entitled to exercise the rights specified in
Section 3.3(f) in respect of such project. For the avoidance
of doubt, in order to be entitled to exercise the rights specified
in Section 3.3(f) , any Additional Project (other than any
Out-of-AMI Project) must be presented to the Company for approval
in accordance with Section 6.12(h) and only if such
Additional Project is not so approved may Rice or Gulfport, as
applicable, avail itself of the rights set forth in Section
3.3(f) in respect of the pursuit by Rice or Gulfport of such
Additional Project. The right to undertake a Sole Risk Project that
interconnects with the assets of the Company or its subsidiaries or
utilizes any services provided by the Company or its subsidiaries
(the “ Sole Risk Right ”) is personal to
GPOR and its Affiliates (for so long as such Person is an Affiliate
of GPOR), and Gulfport, and any transferee of Gulfport’s
Interest, may not exercise its Sole Risk Right if all of its
Interest has been Transferred to an Independent Third Party who is
not a member of the Gulfport Group; provided ,
however , for the avoidance of doubt, for so long as any
such transferee (together with its Affiliates) owns an Interest
sufficient to entitle such transferee and its Affiliates to
designate

 


23
 





 


 


one or more Managers
hereunder, such Manager so designated shall still have all rights
to vote on any Additional Project submitted to the
Board.

been presented to the Company as required by this Article 3
or (B) an Out-of-AMI Project, as applicable (with the preceding (A)
and (B), each, a “ Sole Risk Project ”),
then such Member or its Affiliates will be entitled to pursue such
Sole Risk Project (including any expansions thereof other than any
Material Expansions) outside of the Company at such Member’s
or its Affiliate’s sole cost and expense; provided
that (x) any Material Expansion shall be considered a separate
Restricted Project or Additional Project, as applicable, that must
be presented to the Company for approval by the Managers under
Section 6.12(h) and (y) with respect to any Out-of-AMI
Project, there exists Available Capacity upon entry into each

as a precondition to such participation, must also acquire all of
the assets that comprise such Sole Risk Project from the applicable
Member (or its Affiliates) to which such Material Expansion relates
by paying such Member (or its Affiliates) an amount in cash that
would provide such Member (or its Affiliates) with an IRR of ****
over the period commencing on the date such Member (or its
Affiliates) first made a payment in connection with such project
and ending on the date that the Company consummates such
acquisition. Subject to the terms of a customary confidentiality
agreement, the selling party, the Company and each Member shall
reasonably cooperate to permit the Company and any other Member to
perform a reasonable and customary due diligence investigation of
the applicable assets subject to the execution of customary
confidentiality agreements by the applicable Persons performing
such investigation. The selling party shall provide the Company and
the other Members with sufficient information to permit the other
Members to make an informed investment decision regarding the
Company’s acquisition of the applicable assets. The parties
to such acquisition will reasonably cooperate to effect such
acquisition pursuant to a customary purchase agreement. The party

Section 4.2

     Capital Contribution
Defaults .
If (i) a Member fails to make a Capital Contribution under
Section 4.1(b) in response to a Capital Call validly and
timely made hereunder on or before the date by which such
additional Capital Contribution was required to be contributed
pursuant to Section 4.1(b) ( provided that
such Member shall have an additional five (5) Business Days after
first being notified (the date such notice is given, the “
Default Notice Date ”) of such Member’s
failure to timely make all such Capital Contributions to cure such
default by contributing such amounts) (a “ Capital Call
Default ”), then such Member (and any of its
Affiliates that are also Members ( provided that if both
Rice and RMP (or any of RMP’s Subsidiaries) are Members and
either Rice or RMP (or its Subsidiaries) makes a Capital Call
Default, then RMP (or its Subsidiaries) and Rice will not be
considered to be Affiliates of one another for purposes of this
Section 4.2 )) will be considered to be in default (a
“ Defaulting Member ”), but will remain
fully obligated to contribute such capital to the Company. The
Company (acting at the direction of the Managers designated by the
non-defaulting Members) will be entitled to elect to pursue all
remedies available at law or in equity against the Defaulting
Member, including those specified in (a) below or the
non-Defaulting Member(s) may elect to take the actions specified in
(b) or (c) below:

(h)     
the Company may take
all actions, including court proceedings, as the non-defaulting
Members may deem appropriate, to obtain payment by the Defaulting
Member of the required amount of the Capital Contribution remaining
unpaid, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the
date that the required Capital Contribution was required to be
contributed to the Company until the date it is so contributed, at
the cost and expense of the Defaulting Member;

(i)     
one or more
non-defaulting Members may advance the portion of the Defaulting
Member’s Capital Contribution that is in default, in
accordance with such non-

 


28
 





 


 


defaulting
Members’ respective Percentage Interests, and, at the option
of such non-defaulting Members, the non-defaulting Members making
such advance may be deemed to have made a loan to the Defaulting
Member in the amount of the Capital Contribution so advanced, which
loan will bear interest at the Default Rate from the date that such
advance is made until the loan is repaid in full, and until such
loan is repaid in full, such non-defaulting Members making such
loan to the Defaulting Member will be entitled to receive all
distributions of Available Cash that would otherwise be payable to
the Defaulting Member hereunder, in accordance with such
non-defaulting Members’ respective Percentage Interests. Any
amount treated as being advanced by a non-defaulting Member to a
Defaulting Member shall be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement (other than this Section 4.2(b) ) to be
contributed by the Defaulting Member to the Company as a Capital
Contribution, and any distributions of Available Cash that would
otherwise be made to Defaulting Members but are instead paid to the
non-defaulting Members pursuant to this Section 4.2(b) shall
be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as having been made to
the Defaulting Member and then paid by it to the non-defaulting
Members; or

(j)     
in the event that the
non-defaulting Members (each an “ Electing
Non-Defaulting Member ”) do not elect to treat their
advance of the Defaulting Member’s Capital Contribution as a
loan to the Defaulting Member, such advance shall instead be
treated as an additional Capital Contribution by the Electing
Non-Defaulting Members (a “ Default
Contribution ”) in exchange for an increased Interest
in the Company and the Percentage Interests of the Members shall be
re-determined in accordance with provisions set forth in the
definition of “Percentage Interest” in
Section 1.1 .

(k)     
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the definition of “Unanimous
Board Approval” and Section 6.12 ), for as long as a
Defaulting Member is (i) obligated to contribute capital to the
Company and has failed to contribute all such capital in accordance
with a duly given Capital Call and (ii) the non-defaulting Members
have contributed capital and elected to treat their advance of a
Defaulting Member’s Capital Contribution as a loan to the
Defaulting Member as permitted by Section 4.2(b) , and in
either case, sixty (60) days or more have passed since the Default
Notice Date, then for so long as (but, only for so long as) either
(x) such Defaulting Member fails to contribute such capital or (y)
any amounts are owed by such Defaulting Member under Section
4.2(b) to such non-Defaulting Members following the expiration
of such (60) day period, as applicable, such Defaulting Member may
not be permitted to consent to, vote (directly or through its
Managers, if applicable) or otherwise participate in or make any
decisions with respect to any action or inaction to be taken by or
on behalf of the Company, and the other Members shall have, to the
extent applicable, the sole right to consent to, vote (directly or
through their Managers) and otherwise participate in or make any
decisions with respect to such action or inaction to be taken by or
on behalf of the Company; provided that the Defaulting
Member’s Managers, if any, shall still have the right to
consent to any actions that may require such Managers’
approval if such default did not exist under Sections
6.12(d) , 6.12(e) , 6.12(r) , 6.12(v) , or
6.12(z) .

amount as and will replace the Capital Account of the transferor of
such Interest. To the extent such Member acquires less than all of
the Interest of the transferor of the Interest so acquired by such

Contributions will be in proportion to the Interest it acquires,
and the Capital Account of the transferor who retains an Interest
will be reduced in proportion to the Interest it
retains.

distributive share of Losses, special allocations of loss and
deduction, and the net amount of any liabilities of such Member
