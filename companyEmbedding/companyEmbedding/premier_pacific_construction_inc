We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
security holders.  All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
will go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses 
relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security 
holders.


We currently know of only one local competitor that offers renovation and real 
estate brokerage services as a package. However, to the best of our knowledge, 
there is no other contractor that is willing to provide homeowners with 
renovations and upgrades to their properties without payment up front and 
without being tied to using a particular real estate broker. Our local 
competitor is an established company with the ability to widely promote their 
services via television commercials. There  is no guarantee that we will 
compete successfully with our competition.


Company Description
We were incorporated on March 14, 2012 in the State of Nevada. In March 2012, 
we completed a merger with Premier Pacific Construction, Inc., a California 
corporation (“PPC-CA”). PPC-CA was originally formed in 2000 by our President,
Richard Francella to provide general contracting and


 construction services 
within San Diego County, California. Since our inception, we have operated as 
a construction company providing general contracting and construction services 
to both residential and commercial clients.
  
Our plan is to continue to provide general contracting and construction services
as we have done for more than a decade. In addition, we are also pursuing 
opportunities to work with homeowners who wish to sell their homes in the 
currently weak real estate market and wish to make certain renovations and 
upgrades to increase their potential sales price. In order to assist the 
homeowners, we will complete the renovations and upgrades (hereinafter “pre-sale
renovation and upgrade services”) with no up-front out of pocket costs to the 
homeowner. Rather, the homeowner will agree to pay for our services through 
escrow when they sell. We plan to market our services to real estate brokers.
---

Our principal executive office is located at 13103 Golden Way, Poway, CA 92064, 
and our telephone number is (858) 748-7152.

Premier Pacific Construction Inc's Comment on Competitors and Industry Peers  

We currently know of only one local competitor that offers renovation and real 
estate brokerage services as a package. However, to the best of our knowledge, 
there is no other contractor that is willing to provide homeowners with renovations 
and upgrades to their properties without payment up front and without being tied 
to using a particular real estate broker. Our local competitor is an established 
company with the ability to widely promote their services via television commercials. 
There is no guarantee that we will compete successfully with our competition.
