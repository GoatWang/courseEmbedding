About Us


						O'Shaughnessy Asset Management is a Stamford, Connecticut based quantitative  
                            money management firm. We deliver a broad range of equity portfolios to individual investors,
                            institutional investors, and the high-net-worth clients of financial advisers. We 
                            also manage mutual funds in the United States as well as serving as a 
                            sub-adviser to a family of Canadian mutual funds through the Royal Bank of 
                            Canada.
                        

						    Our investment strategies are based on the research of our CEO Jim 
                            O'Shaughnessy, widely regarded as a pioneer in quantitative equity analysis. Jim 
                            and his team have identified the characteristics that have led to successful 
                            investing over the last fifty years, and it is these characteristics that form 
                            the foundation of our strategies. As of June 30, 2017 Jim and his team managed 
                            approximately $5.5 billion.
                        






Disciplined, Unemotional Investing
Our philosophy is that the best investment strategies are devoid of emotional decision-making. We believe that many conventional managers fail because they tend to overlook fact-based fundamentals in favor of attractive, colorful stories about a company or a stock. At O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, we use stock selection strategies based on long-term, empirical evidence. Our strategies are historically tested and rigorously implemented. We do not seek to deviate from our strategies, giving our investors a process they have been able to count on for years. 

A Transparent Process


						Unlike most quantitative money managers, we are happy to disclose our investment process to our investors. Other quantitative investment managers put their strategies in a "black box," keeping investors in the dark about their portfolios or how they may change over time. Our strategies are in a clear, "Lucite box," because we believe that people should understand how their investments work.
						

Numerous Portfolio Styles and Strategies


						We offer a broad range of equity strategies, from small cap to large cap, growth to value, including multi-capitalization and international strategies. Our key investment strategies consistently rank as leaders within their peer groups. Please review our individual 
                            separate account and mutual funds strategies to learn more.

They Can’t All Be That Smart


“There’s a huge range of possibilities in the smart-beta world, and they can’t all be 
that smart.”—Yves Choueifaty

As the number of factor products increase, it’s important to understand how different portfolio construction methods can lead to very different investment results, even when using the same factors.  OSAM provides a due diligence framework to understand the potential alignment or misalignment of the portfolio and factor through the lens of Active Share.

Factors Are Not Commodities








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

OSAM Research Director Chris Meredith, CFA challenges and dispels the notion that investment factors are commodities. Factors that some view as generic are nuanced both in their definitions and implementation.

Price-to-Book’s Growing Blind Spot








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Has an increase in shareholder transactions (primarily share repurchases) contributed to how price-to-book has gradually become ineffectual in recent years? Learn why investors should consider other valuation metrics instead—such as earnings and EBITDA—that have historically outperformed the more traditional price-to-book factor.

Buybacks Bears and Bulls








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

This paper offers an examination of stocks with strong buybacks, trying to determine if they are thriving because of earnings or stock manipulation.

Peculiar Stock Leadership in 2016








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

The first part of 2016 has been one of the most difficult time periods for active management on record. To shed light on this challenging period we explore the profile of the stocks which have led the Russell 1000® benchmarks.  Characteristics that historically do poorly are leading the market over this period.  Further, the gap of value over growth indices so far this year is more a surge in stocks with terrible sales and earnings growth, and less a triumph of traditional cheap over expensive.

The Economic Cycle: A Factor Investor’s Perspective


“If you spend more than 13 minutes analyzing economic and market forecasts, you’ve wasted 10 minutes.”—Peter Lynch





                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Does the economic cycle have any bearing on investment success? Macro investment houses have constructed intricate frameworks to understand the “economic machine,” but economic data are notoriously prone to revisions, lags, and adjustments in measurement through time—none of which are suitable for timely and reliable investment signals. As factor investors, we believe that certain fundamental characteristics—not economic variables—drive stock returns. We’ve distilled the hundreds of investment factors into cohesive multi-factor themes that can serve as foundational building blocks for equity strategies. Among the litmus tests for those themes is persistence. This paper identifies investment themes that deliver persistent outperformance in multiple different economic environments.

Alpha or Assets? Factor Alpha vs. Smart Beta


“Financial markets lend themselves to initially self-reinforcing but eventually self-defeating processes.”—George Soros





                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Read how to build investment strategies for alpha, not scale—and why we believe the asset management industry has gone in the opposite direction. Though more and more investors are buying “factor”-based strategies, investing using measures like valuation and low volatility, the most popular strategies are applying factors the wrong way: hundreds of holdings and high overlap with their market benchmark (e.g., Smart Beta). Factor Alpha is by far a more powerful way to apply factors, using them first to avoid large chunks of the market and then to build more differentiated portfolios of stocks with only the most attractive overall factor profiles. While not as scaleable as Smart Beta, this alpha-oriented approach has led to much better results for investors.

The Inefficient Canadian Market









                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Read why the Canadian market deserves consideration as a dedicated piece of an investor’s overall asset allocation. Canadian equities have a long history, dating back to 1861, and today it ranks as the world’s fourth largest stock market by market capitalization. Over the period from 1900 to 2014, adjusted for inflation, Canadian equities have returned 5.8 percent annualized, which compares favorably to the U.K’s return of 5.3 percent and slightly lags the U.S. return of 6.5 percent (see also “The Dangers of Indexing in Canada” linked below).

A True Microcap Strategy

Is there an undiscovered market where valuations are not systematically picked apart by Wall Street analysts, where huge changes in valuation often go unnoticed, and a stock’s price is very much at odds with its true value? Read this paper to learn more about the opportunity for consistent, long-term excess returns that awaits investors in the overlooked, undervalued and unappreciated, and uniquely-positioned microcap space.

The Dangers of Indexing in Canada

The Canadian market gets little attention and is rarely a dedicated piece of an overall asset allocation outside of Canada. However, for the past two decades, it has been one of the most consistent-performing developed markets in the world. Investing in Canada via market cap-weighted indexes can introduce unnecessary risks. This paper shows how active management can give investors an edge in the Canada market.

Stocks You Shouldn’t Own








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Active management has two potential advantages versus an index. The first advantage is the one that most people think of: active stock selection. But this paper focuses instead on the second potential advantage: active stock elimination, or identifying stocks not to own in the portfolio. While owning strong performers is the most obvious source of excess returns versus a benchmark, the stocks that are in an index but not in an active portfolio often explain as much of the active portfolio’s relative returns.

Microcap as an Alternative to Private Equity








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Chris Meredith, OSAM's Director of Research & Portfolio Management, and Portfolio Manager Patrick O'Shaughnessy highlight an alternative to private equity: microcap equities. Private equity has become a central component of many institutional and high-net-worth investment portfolios over the past decade. But, while private equity offers potential advantages, it also requires taking distinct risks. In this paper, learn how microcap equities can help mitigate these risks and also provide strong performance by using proven themes for stock selection.

High Conviction Buybacks








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Much has been written on the role that buybacks can play in the overall market and whether or not they are implemented with the interests of investors under consideration. This paper focuses on (1) the pre-disposition of companies with high conviction in their own buyback programs to outperform the majority of companies engaged in low conviction buybacks and (2) how investors can use this to their advantage.

Inefficiency Breeds Opportunity in Small Cap Equities








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

With widespread inefficiencies and a greater dispersion of returns, the small cap space calls for an active management approach. This commentary, redefining inefficiency as opportunity, identifies the significant potentials for excess return in small cap equities and serves as a guide to navigate this often-overlooked area of the market. Read this whitepaper to learn how our disciplined, multi-factor strategy offers an alternative to traditional qualitative stock-picking methods.

The Power of Share Repurchases








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

One  effective strategy in the U.S. over the past several decades has been to buy stocks that are in the midst of repurchasing significant quantities of their shares—but just blindly following buybacks isn’t always a good strategy. This paper outlines a very brief history of buybacks, explores the reasons (good and bad) that companies buy back stock, and explains the huge advantage available to investors who incorporate buybacks into a total “shareholder yield” calculation to be used in their investment strategy, while at the same time avoiding companies that are buying back shares for the wrong reasons.

Alpha Capture and Liquidity — A Look at the Canadian Market








                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Equity investing in the Canadian market poses unique liquidity and alpha capture challenges. Systematic stock selection based on multi-factor composites for value and momentum strikes a balance between absolute return, risk-adjusted return, and persistence of alpha in the most liquid part of the market. OSAM’s portfolio construction process balances alpha generation with market impact costs. This paper articulates the themes of value and momentum in stock selection and demonstrates their potential to result in significant long-term outperformance of Canadian benchmarks.

Value & Momentum — Building a Unique Canadian Equity Portfolio

Canadian equity indexes based on market-cap-weighted constructions are structurally flawed and result in unforeseen concentration risks.  Systematically buying stocks based on their valuations and market momentum has proven to be an effective way of beating market-cap-weighted indexes in markets around the world. These two themes work especially well in the Canadian equity market. This paper outlines why these two themes work so well in Canada, and how to use them to build an investment strategy.

Combining the Best of Passive and Active Investing


“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” —Mark Twain





                                                    Download PDF
                                                    


 

Should investors pay higher fees to active managers in an attempt to beat the market? Or should they instead buy cheap passive index funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs)? The choice between the passive or active approach to investing can have a huge impact on long-term results. In this paper, we evaluate the arguments for each style, and argue for an approach that combines the strengths of both the passive and active approaches.

Stock Crashes are Money-Making Opportunities

Dividend Yield vs. Dividend Growth

Investor appetite for high-yielding companies continues to grow. However, there are those who believe high dividend payments are a poor indicator of a company’s future growth prospects and prefer to select stocks using “dividend growth” instead. Our research suggests that investors should focus on dividend yield rather than dividend growth rates.

Why U.S. Investors Should Look Beyond Dividend Yield

Though U.S. stocks with high dividend yields have become very popular with individual and professional investors, OSAM makes the case for shareholder yield, a factor the Research Team has long advocated, which has provided strong returns for U.S. stocks for more than 80 years. Shareholder yield is the sum
of a company’s dividend yield plus its buyback yield (the percentage of shares outstanding that have been repurchased or issued over the last year).

The Economy and the Stock Market


“The most common cause of low prices is pessimism—sometimes pervasive, sometimes specific to a company or industry. We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces. It’s optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer.”
 —Warren Buffett

Financial Analysts’ Journal said it was “indisputably a major contribution to empirical research on the behavior of common stocks in the United States...conceivably, the influence of What Works on Wall Street will prove immense.”

Jim’s third book, How to Retire Rich, was a New York Times Business and BusinessWeek bestseller. Jim’s most recent book, Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow, was published in 2006. Jim was named “manager of the year” in Gordon Pape’s 2004 Buyers Guide to Mutual Funds for his management of the Royal Bank (RBC) of Canada’s O’Shaughnessy Funds, and the Canadian Investment Awards named the RBC O’Shaughnessy U.S. Value Fund “U.S. Equity Fund of the Year” in 2004 and 2005.

                            approximately $5.5 billion.
                        






Disciplined, Unemotional Investing
Our philosophy is that the best investment strategies are devoid of emotional decision-making. We believe that many conventional managers fail because they tend to overlook fact-based fundamentals in favor of attractive, colorful stories about a company or a stock. At O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, we use stock selection strategies based on long-term, empirical evidence. Our strategies are historically tested and rigorously implemented. We do not seek to deviate from our strategies, giving our investors a process they have been able to count on for years. 

A Transparent Process


						Unlike most quantitative money managers, we are happy to disclose our investment process to our investors. Other quantitative investment managers put their strategies in a "black box," keeping investors in the dark about their portfolios or how they may change over time. Our strategies are in a clear, "Lucite box," because we believe that people should understand how their investments work.
						

Numerous Portfolio Styles and Strategies


						We offer a broad range of equity strategies, from small cap to large cap, growth to value, including multi-capitalization and international strategies. Our key investment strategies consistently rank as leaders within their peer groups. Please review our individual 
                            separate account and mutual funds strategies to learn more.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (0.59% upside)

                        Investment Strategy


                            The strategy screens for what we believe to be market-leading companies as 
                            defined by size, momentum, earnings quality, financial strength, and valuation. From these 
                            market leaders we select stocks with the highest dividend yields. The strategy 
                            is based on a separately managed account launched on May 2003. Please see the 
                            prospectus for the performance of that product.

                                                ** For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC (the “Adviser”) recouped 0.08% of the Fund’s average daily net assets, to bring Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Recouped Management Fees to the Fund’s expense cap of 0.99% of average daily net assets. At the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, the Fund was subject to further recapture of previously waived fees and Fund expenses paid by the Adviser.
                                            
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not 
                                               guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an 
                                               investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be 
                                               worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the fund may 
                                               be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data current to the 
                                               most recent month end may be obtained by calling (877) 291-7827. 
                                               To discourage mutual fund timers the Fund imposes a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 
                                               less than 90 days. Performance data does not reflect the redemption fee. If it 
                                               had, returns would be reduced. Investment performance reflects fee waivers in 
                                               effect. In the absence of such waivers, total return would be reduced.










Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.

                                                 

Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund:
                            The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve political, economic and 
                            currency risks, greater volatility and differences in accounting methods. Small- 
                            and medium-capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater 
                            price volatility than large-capitalization companies. REITs and foreign real 
                            estate companies may be less diversified than other pools of securities, may 
                            have lower trading volumes and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price 
                            movements than the overall securities markets. Risks of derivatives include the 
                            possible imperfect correlation between the value of the instruments and the 
                            underlying assets; risks of default by the other party to the transaction; risks 
                            that the transactions may result in losses that partially or completely offset 
                            gains in portfolio positions; and risks that the instruments may not be liquid.

Biography[edit]
James P. O'Shaughnessy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he attended Saint Thomas Academy as a youth. His fascination with the stock market began at an early age when he started to manually track characteristics common to the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. After studying international economics and business diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, O'Shaughnessy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1986.[4]
After graduating, O'Shaughnessy worked for a family-owned venture capital firm. During this time, his interest in quantitative research was recognized by a colleague who was on the Board of Directors with O'Shaughnessy at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The colleague suggested that O'Shaughnessy's research might be well suited for pension plan management. In 1988, O'Shaughnessy started O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc. and began consulting to large pension funds and foundations.[5]
In 1991, O'Shaughnessy moved his family to Greenwich, Connecticut to be closer to the New York area, where most of his business was located.
O'Shaughnessy continued to apply his research of the stock market and, in 1994, his first book Invest Like the Best was published, followed by the first edition of What Works on Wall Street in 1997, How to Retire Rich in 1998, and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow in 2006.
O'Shaughnessy started his own mutual funds under the names Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value in 1996.[6]
In 1997, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) launched the RBC O'Shaughnessy mutual funds for Canadian investors. Currently, there are seven mutual funds in the RBC O’Shaughnessy funds family.[7]
In 1999, O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio, The Personal Fund Company, to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet.[8] The company was closed in 2001.[9] As part of Netfolio’s concentration on “personal funds” O’Shaughnessy Capital Management sold their mutual fund family to Hennessy Advisors in June 2000.[10]
In 2001, O’Shaughnessy and his team from O’Shaughnessy Capital Management moved to Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), where O’Shaughnessy served as a Senior Managing Director and the executive director of Systematic Equity. In 2007, O’Shaughnessy reached an agreement with Bear Stearns to spin his Systematic team out of BSAM to form O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC.[11][12]
O'Shaughnessy currently serves as Chairman of the Board for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center[13] and also serves on the Board of Directors for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts[14] and the Board of Trustees for Common Good.[15]

Biography[edit]
James P. O'Shaughnessy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he attended Saint Thomas Academy as a youth. His fascination with the stock market began at an early age when he started to manually track characteristics common to the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. After studying international economics and business diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, O'Shaughnessy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1986.[4]
After graduating, O'Shaughnessy worked for a family-owned venture capital firm. During this time, his interest in quantitative research was recognized by a colleague who was on the Board of Directors with O'Shaughnessy at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The colleague suggested that O'Shaughnessy's research might be well suited for pension plan management. In 1988, O'Shaughnessy started O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc. and began consulting to large pension funds and foundations.[5]
In 1991, O'Shaughnessy moved his family to Greenwich, Connecticut to be closer to the New York area, where most of his business was located.
O'Shaughnessy continued to apply his research of the stock market and, in 1994, his first book Invest Like the Best was published, followed by the first edition of What Works on Wall Street in 1997, How to Retire Rich in 1998, and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow in 2006.
O'Shaughnessy started his own mutual funds under the names Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value in 1996.[6]
In 1997, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) launched the RBC O'Shaughnessy mutual funds for Canadian investors. Currently, there are seven mutual funds in the RBC O’Shaughnessy funds family.[7]
In 1999, O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio, The Personal Fund Company, to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet.[8] The company was closed in 2001.[9] As part of Netfolio’s concentration on “personal funds” O’Shaughnessy Capital Management sold their mutual fund family to Hennessy Advisors in June 2000.[10]
In 2001, O’Shaughnessy and his team from O’Shaughnessy Capital Management moved to Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), where O’Shaughnessy served as a Senior Managing Director and the executive director of Systematic Equity. In 2007, O’Shaughnessy reached an agreement with Bear Stearns to spin his Systematic team out of BSAM to form O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC.[11][12]
O'Shaughnessy currently serves as Chairman of the Board for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center[13] and also serves on the Board of Directors for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts[14] and the Board of Trustees for Common Good.[15]

Biography[edit]
James P. O'Shaughnessy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he attended Saint Thomas Academy as a youth. His fascination with the stock market began at an early age when he started to manually track characteristics common to the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. After studying international economics and business diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, O'Shaughnessy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1986.[4]
After graduating, O'Shaughnessy worked for a family-owned venture capital firm. During this time, his interest in quantitative research was recognized by a colleague who was on the Board of Directors with O'Shaughnessy at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The colleague suggested that O'Shaughnessy's research might be well suited for pension plan management. In 1988, O'Shaughnessy started O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc. and began consulting to large pension funds and foundations.[5]
In 1991, O'Shaughnessy moved his family to Greenwich, Connecticut to be closer to the New York area, where most of his business was located.
O'Shaughnessy continued to apply his research of the stock market and, in 1994, his first book Invest Like the Best was published, followed by the first edition of What Works on Wall Street in 1997, How to Retire Rich in 1998, and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow in 2006.
O'Shaughnessy started his own mutual funds under the names Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value in 1996.[6]
In 1997, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) launched the RBC O'Shaughnessy mutual funds for Canadian investors. Currently, there are seven mutual funds in the RBC O’Shaughnessy funds family.[7]
In 1999, O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio, The Personal Fund Company, to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet.[8] The company was closed in 2001.[9] As part of Netfolio’s concentration on “personal funds” O’Shaughnessy Capital Management sold their mutual fund family to Hennessy Advisors in June 2000.[10]
In 2001, O’Shaughnessy and his team from O’Shaughnessy Capital Management moved to Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), where O’Shaughnessy served as a Senior Managing Director and the executive director of Systematic Equity. In 2007, O’Shaughnessy reached an agreement with Bear Stearns to spin his Systematic team out of BSAM to form O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC.[11][12]
O'Shaughnessy currently serves as Chairman of the Board for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center[13] and also serves on the Board of Directors for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts[14] and the Board of Trustees for Common Good.[15]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
