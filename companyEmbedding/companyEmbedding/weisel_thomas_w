Biography[edit]
Weisel was born in February 1941 at the Mayo Clinic, son of Wilson Weisel a prominent surgeon and Betty Amos Weisel. Weisel was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and graduated from Stanford University with a degree in economics in 1963. Weisel was a champion speed skater as a teenager and won five national age-group championships at speed skating, and came third at Olympic trials in 1959.[2]
In 1966, Weisel received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[3] He began his career as a research analyst working for William Hutchinson on the West Coast.[4]
In 1971, Weisel co-founded Robertson, Coleman, Siebel & Weisel (the firm had begun with three partners in 1969). In 1978 Weisel became chief executive of the firm and prompted the departure of his co-founders Sandy Robertson and Robert Colman. Weisel changed the name of the firm to Montgomery Securities. Robertson left the firm in October 1978 and founded Robertson, Colman, Stephens & Woodman, the predecessor of the investment banking firm Robertson Stephens.[5]
Montgomery Securities was behind numerous initial public offerings during the rise of tech stocks in the 1980s and 90s, including AMGen in 1983, Micron Technologies in 1984, and Yahoo! Inc. in 1996.[6] The firm was one of four investment banks that, as a group, were referred to as the “Four Horsemen,” due to their prominence in the underwriting of the IPOs of many of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley at the time.[6][7] From 1989-96, Montgomery Securities raised $57.3 billion in equity and underwrote 293 IPOs.[8]
In 1997, Weisel spearheaded a $1.3 billion acquisition of Montgomery Securities by NationsBank.[9] The following year, however, NationsBank acquired BankAmerica Corp. The newly combined investment banking units later became known as Banc of America Securities.
In January 1999, Weisel, together with other personnel from the former Montgomery Securities secured venture capital funding from Silicon Valley investors and launched investment banking and wealth management firm Thomas Weisel Partners. The firm closed its first year of business with revenue of $186 million, completing $23 billion in transactions, including advising Yahoo! in their $4.6 billion merger with GeoCities. The firm’s performance led Investment Dealer’s Digest to name Weisel Investment Banker of the Year in 1999, and Harvard Business School used Thomas Weisel Partners as a field case for six years.[10][11][12] Weisel also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Venture Capital Association in 2006, in part due to the success of Thomas Weisel Partners.[12] The firm became part of Stifel Financial in 2010, which Weisel joined as co-chairman.
Professional sports[edit]
Weisel has been active in professional sports as an investor, board member, manager, and participant for most of his career. In 1982, he was a Bronze medalist in the U.S. Master’s Skiing Championship.[13] Weisel is also a five-time National Master’s Cycling champion, and three-time World Master’s Cycling champion (1990-1992).[14]
Since 1977, Weisel has been on the board of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team and was elected Chairman in 1983, a position he held until 1994.[15] During this time, Weisel was responsible for merging the U.S. Ski Team with the U.S. Ski Association, and overhauling its governance and funding.[16] In 1999, the USSA awarded him the Julius Blegen Award, their highest honor.[15] Weisel was also honored by the United States Olympic Foundation in 2011 with the Foundation’s George M. Steinbrenner III Sport Leadership Award. The award was given in recognition of Weisel’s financial support and leadership since 1977.[15]
Weisel started Montgomery Sports in 1987 as a cycling venture. The team was renamed Subaru-Montgomery in the early 1990s, then Montgomery-Bell (for Bell Sports), and finally renamed for the U.S. Postal Service. He is also the founder of the USA Cycling Development Foundation and has served as its Chairman since 2000.[17] As chairman, Weisel reorganized and restructured the Foundation similar to the USSA, revamping the organization’s board and funding sources.[18]
In 2000, Weisel organised a bailout of USA Cycling which was experiencing financial difficulties.[19]
Weisel was an important financial backer of Tailwind Sports, a company formed to manage the U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team (USPS), which cyclist Lance Armstrong joined in 1998. Weisel formed a relationship with Armstrong early in Armstrong’s career and was a primary source of support and funding. In a 2002 article, Armstrong credited Weisel for founding and investing in the team in its early stages, before its championship wins.[20] Armstrong had previously been a team member of Weisel's Subaru-Montgomery team. Tailwind Sports were the owners of the USPS team for the first five of Armstrong's Tour de France wins.
In 2006 Weisel contributed to the "Floyd Fairness Fund" with fellow Tailwind Sports owners to support cyclist Floyd Landis when he was accused of doping offences. In 2010 Landis filed a lawsuit against Weisel, Lance Armstrong, Johan Bruyneel, Bill Stapleton, Barton Knaggs, Tailwind Sports, and Capital Sports and Entertainment under the False Claims Act, alleging that the defendants had defrauded the federal government. A federal suit was filed in 2013, but the government declined to name Weisel, Knaggs, Stapleton, and Capital Sports and Entertainment as defendants.[21]
Weisel vehemently denied Landis’s allegations, and claims against him were dropped by a federal judge in June 2014.[22][23]
Art collection[edit]
Weisel is a collector of modern art, and an elected trustee of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[24] Weisel also served on the Board of Trustees for the New York Museum of Modern Art from 1996-2011. His personal collection contains American art from the early New York school, the California figurative movement, and Native American art spanning 1000 years with a focus on the American Southwest.[25]
In November 2002 Sotheby's held an auction of 21 pieces from Weisel's 700 piece art collection, including pieces by artists Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Arshile Gorky, and Wayne Thiebaud.[26][27] The Sotheby's sale was expected to bring between $43 to $60 million, but realised $33 million on the night, with eight of the twenty-one works left unsold at the initial auction. The star piece was De Kooning's Orestes which sold for $13.2 million.[28]
In 2014, Weisel donated around 200 pieces of art from his Native American collection to the de Young Fine Arts museum in San Francisco, and in 2016, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art will rename three of its California art galleries after Weisel.[25] Weisel also endowed the SFMOMA’s curator of painting and sculpture in 2014.[25] He has gifted or promised pieces to the SFMOMA and NYMOMA from his personal collection including works by Mark Grotjahn, Wayne Thiebaud, Joan Brown, Richard Serra, Andreas Gursky, Mark Bradford, Nathan Oliveira and Lee Mullican.[25]
Personal[edit]
In 2010, Weisel married his current wife, Janet Barnes. Barnes spent 25 years in the finance industry, and currently serves on the board of the de Young Museum of Fine Arts.[29] Outside of her professional roles, Barnes is also a mountain climber, skier, and cyclist.
Weisel has seven children. The oldest three children have completed graduate and post-graduate degrees, and are employed in real estate development, investing, and educational publishing. The middle two are currently attending school and are actively involved in sports. Weisel’s son won the U18 National Slalom Championship in 2013 and is in his second year on the U.S. Ski Team.[30][31]
In 2003 Richard L. Brandt wrote a biography of Weisel, Capital Instincts: Life As an Entrepreneur, Financier, and Athlete.[4]

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

I am on a fixed income. I have been working on my credit, so I know that I need a car and I need to start my own business. I am a leader and serious about my finances.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Employment Agreement - Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc. and Thomas W. Weisel



Employment Forms


Employment Agreement. Employers can customize an employment agreement that states the salary, benefits, working hours and other important provisions for their new or existing employee.
Consulting Agreement. Answer simple questions to build a contract with a consultant. Specify the services rendered, when payment is due, as well as IP rights.
Commission Agreement. Employers who compensate their sales employees based on commissions can prepare an agreement to reduce misunderstandings by specifying the base salary and how commissions are calculated.
Executive Employment Agreement. Companies may offer their business executives a contract that is different from the one provided to their regular employees. Executive employment agreements may be more complex because the compensation structure may include a combination of salary and commissions, provide for bonuses based on sales, stock or other financial targets, and include non-compete, confidentiality and severance provisions.
Sales Representative Contract. Independent sales representatives offer companies the potential to increase the sale of products or services without the burden of increasing headcount. Both parties should understand how commissions are calculated, when commissions will be paid, as well as how the representative will treat confidential information from the company and whether the representative may also sell a competing line of products or services.

CEO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


      Thomas W. Weisel
      Thomas Weisel Partners Group, Inc.
      One Montgomery Street, 37th Floor
      San Francisco, California 94104
    

      February 1, 2006
    

      Dear Thom:
    

           This is your EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") with Thomas Weisel Partners Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TWPG Inc." and, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates and its and their respective predecessors and successors, the "Firm"). This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of your employment with the Firm.
    

      1. Employment


           TWPG Inc. does hereby employ you and you do hereby accept employment as Chief Executive Officer of TWPG Inc. You shall have all the duties, responsibilities and authority normally attendant to the office of Chief Executive Officer of the Firm, and you shall render services consistent with such positions on the terms set forth herein. As Chief Executive Officer of the Firm, you shall report solely and directly to the Board. In addition, you shall have such other executive and managerial powers and duties with respect to the Firm as may reasonably be assigned to you by the Board, to the extent consistent with your position and status as set forth above. In no event shall your duties, responsibilities and authority be less than those initially performed by you as Chief Executive Officer. All other employees of the Firm shall report to you, either directly or through such other personnel as the Board or you may designate. Subject to the discretion of the Board, you may also be designated as Chairman of the Board.
    

           You agree to devote substantially all of your business time, labor, skill and energies to the business and affairs of the Firm during the Employment Period, subject to periods of vacation and sick leave to which you are entitled. Except as otherwise provided below, during the Employment Period, you will not render any business, commercial or professional services to any individual or any entity that is not part of the Firm. However, you may serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards, manage personal investments, deliver lectures or fulfill speaking engagements, so long as these activities do not significantly interfere with your performance of your responsibilities under this Agreement and any service on a corporate, civic or charitable board is pre-approved by the Board. The Firm has discussed with you the activities that you are conducting at the time of this Agreement and agrees that these activities, as well as any substitute activities that are similar in nature and scope, will not significantly interfere with your responsibilities under this Agreement.
    
 


 


      2. Term of Employment


           Subject to Section 8, the term of your employment shall commence on the date of this Agreement and end on December 31, 2009 (such period, the "Initial Employment Period"). After the Initial Employment Period your term of employment shall be automatically extended for successive two-year periods, subject to Section 8 and unless otherwise agreed in writing by you and the Firm 90 days prior to the end of such periods. References in this Agreement to "your employment" are to your employment under this Agreement.
    

      3. Board Membership


           During the Employment Period, TWPG Inc. shall take all reasonable action to cause you to be appointed or elected to the Board, and to serve as Chairman of the Board, subject to any applicable laws, rules and regulations and any corporate governance policies and practices of TWPG Inc. In the event that, in the reasonable judgment of the Board, based on its consideration of applicable legal, regulatory or corporate governance (including stock exchange) requirements, the Board determines that the Firm should split the function of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, you may be replaced as Chairman of the Board (but not as Chief Executive Officer) without it being considered a termination of your employment hereunder or otherwise a breach by TWPG Inc. of this Agreement.
    

      4. Location


           In connection with your employment by the Firm, you shall be based at the headquarters of TWPG Inc. in San Francisco, California, except for travel reasonably required for the Firm's business.
    

      5. Compensation


                (a) Base Salary. During the Employment Period, subject to your continued employment hereunder, you shall be paid an annualized base salary (the "Base Salary") of U.S. $200,000, payable in semi-monthly installments. Your base salary shall be reviewed annually by the Firm, and may be increased (but not decreased) at each such annual review.
    

                (b) Annual Bonus. During the Employment Period, subject to your continued employment hereunder, you may be awarded an annual bonus (the "Bonus") pursuant to the Thomas Weisel Partners Group, Inc. Bonus Plan.
    

                (c) Equity Compensation. During the Employment Period, subject to your continued employment hereunder, you shall be eligible to participate in all equity incentive plans for senior executives of the Firm as may be in effect from time to time, in accordance with the terms of any such plan.
    
-2-


 


      6. Employee Benefit Plans


           During the Employment Period, subject to your continued employment hereunder, you shall be eligible to participate in each employee retirement and welfare benefit plan and program of the type made available to the Firm's employees generally, and senior executives specifically, in accordance with their terms and as such plans and programs may be in effect, which may include from time to time, without limitation, savings, profit-sharing and other retirement plans or programs, 401(k), medical, dental, flexible spending account, hospitalization, short-term and long-term disability and life insurance plans.
    

      7. Other Employee Benefits


                (a) Vacation. You will be entitled to paid annual vacation during the Employment Period (totaling at least four weeks in each calendar year) on a basis that is at least as favorable as that provided to you as of the date of this Agreement.
    

                (b) Reimbursement of Business Expenses. You will be reimbursed for all reasonable travel, entertainment and other business expenses incurred by you in performing your responsibilities under this Agreement, subject to the Firm's normal policies and practices (including appropriate documentation requirements) for senior executives.
    

                (c) Facilities. During the Employment Period, you will be provided with office space, facilities, secretarial support and other business and personal services consistent with your position on a basis that is at least as favorable as that provided to you as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that such support and services shall be subject to periodic review and modification by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.
    

      8. Early Termination of Your Employment


                (a) No Reason Required. You or TWPG Inc. may terminate your employment at any time for any reason, or for no reason, subject to compliance with Section 8(e).
    

                (b) Termination by TWPG Inc. for Cause.
    

                (1) TWPG Inc. may terminate your employment under any of the following circumstances, and such termination shall be considered "for Cause":
    

           (A) Your continued and willful failure to perform substantially your responsibilities to the Firm under this Agreement. "Cause" does not, however, include any such failure after TWPG Inc. gives you a Termination Notice without Cause, or you give the Firm a Termination Notice for Good Reason, in each case in accordance with Section 8(e).
    
-3-


 


           (B) Your willful engagement in illegal conduct, fraud, embezzlement or gross misconduct, in each case, that causes financial or reputational harm to the Firm.
    

           (C) Your commission or conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony.
    

           (D) Your willful and material breach or violation of (i) this Agreement, the Partners' Equity Agreement, the Pledge Agreement or any other written agreement between you and the Firm, or (ii) the code of conduct and ethics of TWPG Inc. or any other Firm policy in respect of insider trading, hedging or confidential information.
    

           (E) Your willful attempt to obstruct or willful failure to cooperate with any investigation authorized by the Board or any governmental or self-regulatory entity.
    

           (F) Your disqualification or bar by any governmental or self-regulatory authority from serving in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement or your loss of any governmental or self-regulatory license that is reasonably necessary for you to perform your responsibilities to the Firm under this Agreement, if (i) the disqualification, bar or loss continues for more than 90 days and (ii) during that period the Firm uses its good faith efforts to cause the disqualification or bar to be lifted or the license replaced. While any disqualification, bar or loss continues during your employment, you will serve in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement to whatever extent legally permissible and, if your employment is not permissible, you will be placed on leave (which will be paid to the extent legally permissible).
    

      For this definition of Cause, (i) no act or omission by you will be "willful" unless it is made by you in bad faith or without a reasonable belief that your act or omission was in the best interests of the Firm and (ii) any act or omission by you based on authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or on the advice of counsel for the Firm will be deemed made in good faith and in the best interests of the Firm.
    

           (2) To terminate your employment "for Cause", the Board must determine in good faith that Cause has occurred and TWPG Inc. must comply with Section 8(e).
    

           (3) TWPG Inc. may place you on paid leave for up to 30 consecutive days while it determines whether there is a basis to terminate your employment for Cause. This leave will not constitute Good Reason.
    
-4-


 


      (c) Termination by You for Good Reason.
    

                (1) You may terminate your employment under the following circumstances and such termination shall be considered "for Good Reason":
    

           (A) Any material and adverse change in your title, position or duties with the Firm (including by reason of removal or failure to be elected or re-elected as a director, other than as stipulated in the last sentence of Section 3 hereof).
    

           (B) Any failure by TWPG Inc. to provide you with authority, responsibilities and reporting relationship as provided in Section 1 or any material and adverse reduction in your authority, responsibilities or reporting relationship, in each case other than any isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure by TWPG Inc. that is not in bad faith and is cured promptly on your giving notice to TWPG Inc.
    

           (C) The Firm moving its principal executive offices outside the San Francisco, California metropolitan area.
    

           (D) A material breach by the Firm of any of its obligations to you under this Agreement.
    

           (E) Any purported termination by TWPG Inc. of your employment that is in breach of this Agreement.
    

           (F) Any failure by TWPG Inc. to maintain a bonus plan and/or equity incentive plan (and/or equivalent corporate compensation policies) which when taken together are substantially comparable to the plans described in Sections 5(b) and (c) above; provided that, any reasonable period during which such a plan or policy is not maintained and during which TWPG Inc. is in good faith seeking board of directors or stockholder approval of the renewal or replacement of any such plan or policy shall, during such reasonable period, not be deemed a failure by TWPG Inc. to maintain such a plan or policy.
    

                (2) To terminate your employment "for Good Reason", Good Reason must have occurred and you must comply with Section 8(e). However, (A) if you do not give a Termination Notice within 90 days after you have knowledge that an event constituting Good Reason has occurred, the event will no longer constitute Good Reason and (B) you must give the Firm a 30-day period to cure after notice of the first event constituting Good Reason under Section 8(c).
    

      (d) Termination on Disability or Death.
    
-5-


 


                (1) TWPG Inc. may terminate your employment upon your Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means your absence from your responsibilities with TWPG Inc. on a full-time basis for 180 days in any consecutive 12 months as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness or injury. If TWPG Inc. determines in good faith that your Disability has occurred, it may give you Termination Notice. If within 30 days of the Termination Notice you do not return to full-time performance of your responsibilities, your employment will terminate. If you do return to full-time performance in that 30-day period, the Termination Notice will be cancelled for all purposes of this Agreement. Except as provided in this Section 8(d), any of your incapacity due to mental or physical illness or injury will not affect TWPG Inc.'s obligations under this Agreement.
    

                (2) Your employment will terminate automatically on your death.
    

      (e) Advance Notice Generally Required.
    

                (1) To terminate your employment before the end of the Employment Period, either you or TWPG Inc. must provide a Termination Notice to the other. A "Termination Notice" is a written notice that states the specific provision of this Agreement on which termination is based, including, if applicable, the specific clause of the definition of Cause or Good Reason and a reasonably detailed description of the facts that permit termination under that clause. The failure to include any fact in a Termination Notice that contributes to a showing of Cause or Good Reason does not preclude either party from asserting that fact in enforcing its rights under this Agreement.
    

                (2) You and TWPG Inc. agree to provide 90 days' advance Termination Notice of any termination prior to the end of the Employment Period or prior to any non-extension of the Employment Period in accordance with Section 2, unless your employment is terminated by TWPG Inc. for Cause or because of your Disability or death. Accordingly, the effective date of early termination of your employment will be 90 days after Termination Notice is given except that (A) the effective date will be the date of TWPG Inc.'s Termination Notice if your employment is terminated by TWPG Inc. for Cause, although TWPG Inc. may provide a later effective date in the Termination Notice, (B) the effective date will be 30 days after Termination Notice is given if your employment is terminated because of your Disability, and (C) the effective date will be the time of your death if your employment is terminated because of your death. TWPG Inc. may elect to place you on paid leave for all or part of the advance notice period. Notwithstanding this Section 8(e)(2), if you die or become Disabled during your employment but after you provide a valid Termination Notice with Good Reason or TWPG Inc. provides Termination Notice without Cause, your termination will be treated as a termination with Good Reason, effective as of the date of your death or
    
-6-


 


      Disability. The effective date of termination of your employment is referred to as the "Date of Termination" in this Agreement.
    

      9. TWPG Inc.'s Obligations in Connection with Your Termination


           (a) General Effect. On termination in accordance with Section 8, your employment will end and the Firm will have no further obligations to you except as provided in this Section 9 (other than pursuant to the employee benefit plans and programs established by the Firm pursuant to which you have accrued amounts and benefits).
    

           (b) For Good Reason or Without Cause. If, during the Employment Period, TWPG Inc. terminates your employment without Cause or you terminate your employment for Good Reason:
    

           (1) TWPG Inc. will pay you, in a lump sum, the following as of the end of your employment: (A) the amount of your remaining Base Salary from the Date of Termination through the end of the then-existing Employment Period (solely for purposes of this Clause (A), the then-existing Employment Period shall be determined as if your employment were not then terminated), (B) your unpaid Base Salary for periods prior to your termination, and pay with respect to any of your accrued but unused vacation, (C) any accrued expense reimbursements and other cash entitlements, (D) any unpaid but vested Bonus and (E) any unpaid compensation deferred by you (together with any interest and/or earnings through the end of your employment) other than pursuant to a tax-qualified plan (the amounts set forth in Clauses (B), (C), (D) and (E) of this Section 9(b)(1), your "Accrued Compensation"). In addition, TWPG Inc. will timely pay you any amounts and provide you any benefits that are required, or to which you are entitled, under any plan, contract or arrangement of the Firm (together, the "Other Benefits").
    

           (2) TWPG Inc. will pay you in a lump sum an amount equal to the sum of (A) the average of the Bonuses paid or payable to you for the three fiscal years ending before Termination Notice is given (your "Historic Bonus") plus (B) the product of your Historic Bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days elapsed since the date of this agreement (or if such termination occurs after December 31, 2009, the number of days elapsed since this Agreement was last renewed in accordance with Section 2), and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the Initial Employment Period (or if such termination occurs after December 31, 2009, 730 days). In calculating your Historic Bonus:
    

           (A) your Bonus for each of the 2003, 2004 and 2005 fiscal years will deemed to be $1,000,000; and
    
-7-


 


           (B) compensation will be deemed paid or payable even if it was deferred and any Bonus for a fiscal year for which you were employed for less than the full fiscal year will be annualized.
    

           (3) All stock options issued by TWPG Inc. to you will vest and become immediately exercisable and will remain exercisable for a period of 12 months after the end of your employment (or, if earlier, until they would have expired but for your termination). All restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity-based compensation awarded by TWPG Inc. to you will vest and become immediately payable. The benefits in this Section 9(b)(3) are referred to as "Accelerated Vesting".
    

           (4) For 24 months following the Date of Termination, you, your spouse and your dependents will continue to be entitled to participate in each of the Firm's employee benefit and welfare plans providing for medical, dental, hospitalization, life or disability insurance on a basis that is at least as favorable as in effect immediately before Termination Notice was given (the "Welfare Benefits"). However, if the Firm's plans do not permit you, your spouse or your dependents to participate on this basis, TWPG Inc. will provide Welfare Benefits (with the same after-tax effect for you) outside of the plans. If you become employed during such 24-month period and are eligible for coverage from your new employer, the Welfare Benefits will be secondary to your new coverage (if the Firm reimburses you for any increased cost and provides any additional benefits that are necessary to provide you with the full Welfare Benefits).
    

           (c) For Cause or Without Good Reason. If TWPG Inc. terminates your employment for Cause or you terminate your employment without Good Reason, TWPG Inc. will pay your Accrued Compensation and Other Benefits.
    

           (d) For Your Disability or Death. If, during the Employment Period, your employment terminates as a result of your death or Disability, TWPG Inc. will pay your Accrued Compensation and Other Benefits.
    

           (e) Condition. TWPG Inc. will not be required to make the payments and provide the benefits stated in this Section 9 unless and until you execute and deliver to TWPG Inc. a release of claims releasing the Firm, its affiliates, and each member of the Firm and any of their respective past or present officers, directors, employees or agents from any and all liabilities to you. This agreement will be in a form reasonably and mutually satisfactory to you and TWPG Inc.; provided that, in the event of your termination under any of the circumstances described in Section 9(c) or 9(d), no such release shall be required prior to the payment of any Accrued Compensation of the type described in any of clauses (B), (C), (D) or (E) of the definition thereof.
    

           (f) Timing. The benefits provided in this Section 9 will begin at the end of your employment, and any cash payments owed you under this Section 9 will be paid in
    
-8-


 


      one lump sum within 30 days of the Date of Termination or at any earlier time required by applicable law. To the extent required under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, to avoid the imposition of additional tax penalties upon you, any payment of such benefits will be delayed for six months from the Date of Termination.
    

      10. Certain Covenants


           (a) Covenants in Partners' Equity Agreement. You agree and acknowledge that you shall comply with each of the covenants contained in the Partners' Equity Agreement, including, without limitation, covenants relating to confidential information, noncompetition and non-solicitation, in each case in accordance with the terms thereof.
    

           (b) Intellectual Property Rights; Use of Names. As between you and the Firm, all right, title and interest, whether known or unknown, in any intellectual property that is discovered, invented or developed directly or indirectly by, or disclosed to you, in the course of rendering services under this Agreement or in the course of rendering services to any predecessors to the Firm, will be the sole and exclusive property of the Firm. You agree to do anything reasonably requested by the Firm in furtherance of perfecting the Firm's possession of, and title to, any of such intellectual property.
    

           Without limiting the foregoing under this Section 10(b), to the extent you have any right, title or interest in any name, trademark or service mark, whether currently existing or arising in the future, that includes any of "Thomas Weisel," "Thomas Weisel Partners," "TWP," "Tailwind" or any name, trade mark or service mark that is derivative of any of the foregoing, including any domain names relating to any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Weisel Names"), you hereby grant to the Firm a worldwide, perpetual, exclusive and royalty-free right and license, substantially in the form attached as Annex A hereto, to use the Weisel Names in connection with the business and affairs, whether currently existing or arising in the future, of the Firm; provided that you shall be permitted to use your name under any of the conditions or for any of the purposes listed in Annex B hereto.

In the event that the law of any state or other jurisdiction requires the consent of an employee for such deductions, this Agreement shall serve as such consent.

Any attempt to effect any of the preceding in violation of this Section 11(b), whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be void.
    

           (c) Assumption by any Surviving Company. Before the effectiveness of any merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar transaction (including an exchange offer combined with a merger or consolidation) involving TWPG Inc. (a "Reorganization") or any sale, lease or other disposition (including by way of a series of transactions or by way of merger, consolidation, stock sale or similar transaction involving one or more subsidiaries) of all or substantially all of the Firm's consolidated assets (a "Sale"), TWPG Inc. will cause (1) the Surviving Company to unconditionally assume this Agreement in writing and (2) a copy of the assumption to be provided to you.
