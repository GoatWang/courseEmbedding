PDF of this story  —  Flipbook of this issue




Born and raised in Greece, Sotirios Vahaviolos could have
followed the military route most young men take. Fortunately
for many users of bridges and highways, Vahaviolos
pursued engineering and, for the past 40 years, has made it
his business to monitor the safety and wear and tear of these
vast structures.


In 1978, Vahaviolos founded Physical Acoustics
Corp. (now Mistras Group Inc.), a leader in nondestructive
testing (NDT) and acoustics emissions
that provides “early warning” information about
the degradation of bridges and highways.


“Think of a doctor,” says Vahaviolos. “If you
have a health problem that requires an ultrasound
or sonogram, your general practitioner would send
you to a specialist. We do the same thing but in
structures.”


As a child, Vahaviolos experimented with electronics
and knew he would be an engineer. He also
knew he would start his own business like his father,
who ran a butcher shop in Sparta, Greece. 


“It
was in my genes to work for myself,” he adds.


Vahaviolos left Greece in 1966 to study electrical
engineering at Fairleigh Dickinson University in
New Jersey. After graduation, he joined AT&T Bell
Laboratories as a researcher and remained there
until he launched Mistras.


Vahaviolos has sustained a successful business
for four decades but not without its share
of challenges.


“I made the classic mistakes that many entrepreneurs
make—undercapitalized, working on
product concepts that took longer to manufacture,
and having customers accept them slowly and with
great reluctance,” he says.


Headquartered in Princeton, Mistras steadily
grew after it expanded with the acquisition of a national
NDT services provider.


Mistras went public in 2009 on the New York
Stock Exchange—it now has continuous annual
revenue growth of 30 percent. Its technology monitors
many important and historic bridges, including
the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and
the Hammersmith Bridge in London. Mistras also
provides “asset protection inspection solutions”
to refineries, nuclear, fossil, and chemical plants,
pipelines, and aerospace structures, and it provides
software to perform risk-based asset integrity
management.


The idea behind Mistras began while Vahaviolos
worked at Bell Labs.


“I was inspired by many colleagues who were
starting their own businesses,” says Vahaviolos.
“Once it was clear to me that the field of structural
health monitoring was thirsty for technology-based
solutions, I approached AT&T to give me a license
of my 15 or so patents to start a new company.
They did, and they became my first and best customer.”


AT&T also gave Vahaviolos a full scholarship to
pursue his master’s and PhD in electrical engineering
at Columbia.


His thesis adviser, Professor Henry Meadows,
urged him to become more interdisciplinary and
work with the School of Mines and civil engineering.


“That led me to focusing on NDT today,” says
Vahaviolos.


Thirty-five years after graduation, Vahaviolos
remains connected to Columbia. He and his company
have been working with Raimondo Betti, chair
of the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering
Mechanics, on a new NDT system to monitor
cables of suspension bridges.


“Sotirios is a lively personality. Very easy to get
along with and work with,” says Betti. “He is a pioneer
in the field.”
