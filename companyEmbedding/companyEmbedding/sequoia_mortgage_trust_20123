For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Moody's tweaks assessment, tapped to rate Redwood deal

June 20, 2012
Jon Prior




KEYWORDS Business California Company Location Credit Rating Credit rating agency Electronic Arts Finance Fixed income securities Moody's Mortgage Mortgage loan Mortgage-backed security Redwood Trust San Francisco Securities Securitization Sequoia Mortgage Trust Structured finance

Redwood Trust (RWT) selected Moody's Investor Service to rate its latest $293 million mortgage-backed securities deal for the first time since the two firms disagreed over an issuance early last year.Moody's was not selected to rate the last four deals from Redwood, a real estate investment trust in California and one of the very few issuers of private-label MBS since the credit markets collapsed in 2007.In February 2011, Moody's released a report detailing credit risk from an earthquake the agency said could drive up losses on a Redwood offering because more than 56% of the underlying collateral was located in California.The latest deal reached the market this week as the third in the annual series, Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-3. Less than half of the properties are located in California. Roughly 18% are located in San Francisco, down from more than 26%, 31% and 32% of the last three Redwood deals respectively, according to the Moody's pre-sale report.Redwood also recruited more originators than before. There are 18 loan originators in the latest deal.Moody's tweaked certain originator criteria on the deal to reflect Redwood as an aggregator instead of an originator. The agency put more emphasis on Redwood's ability to monitor future loan performance of its originators as opposed to its operational and financial stability as an originator itself. Moody's moved its "ability" rating weight to 40% from 30% and reduced its "stability" rating weight to 20% from 30%."As an aggregator, Redwood buys closed loans from approved sellers; it does not manufacture individual residential mortgage loans. Consequently, it does not need the level of human resources or support teams necessary to originate loans," Moody's said in the assessment.Also, Moody's found that no loan Redwood securitized since 2010 had ever gone 60-plus days delinquent.Both Kroll Ratings and Fitch Ratings were selected to rate the deal as well, leaving out Standard & Poor's. Many institutional investors will not buy a private-label security unless two of the three largest credit ratings agencies are selected to grade the offering."The change in geographic concentration from earlier Sequoia transactions, our positive originator assessments, the quality of the loans, the extensive third-party review, the satisfactory reps and warrants, and the structure that mitigated tail risk were factors in us being able to provide the desired Aaa (sf) rating on this deal," a Moody's spokesman said.Redwood cannot speak on any deals before closing.jprior@housingwire.com@JonAPrior

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.
