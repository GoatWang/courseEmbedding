Governance

Share:






 

Boards, as well as organizations, are most successful when firmly rooted in mission-driven core values and creating long-term sustainable value for customers and shareholders.  Boards have an obligation to stay engaged and provide the requisite skills to create and maintain a culture of constructive challenge and competence. An effective board is especially key in today’s challenging regulatory environment, particularly in the area of understanding strategy and succession planning.
The most successful CEOs learn how to effectively communicate and share information with their boards.
The establishment of an effective Board evaluation process, board leadership, the creation of board member criteria for candidates, directors and committee members, committee structures and charters, board education and director orientation, bylaws, ethics, conflict of interest policies and enterprise risk management policies are the key drivers to ensuring the fulfillment of fiduciary responsibilities as a director and board.
To find out how Stuart Levine & Associates can help your Board  Governance, contact us.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORECut To The Chase: And 99 Other Rules To Liberate Yourself And Gain Back The Gift Of Timeby Levine, Stuart R.DECIDE WHAT NOT TO DO# 46 TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO USE YOUR TIME# 97 TAKE BACK THE WEEKENDIn Cut to the Chase, bestselling author Stuart R. Levine reveals 100 no-nonsense rules on how to be more effective at work and make the best use of your most precious resource:your time. Just before CEO and consultant Stuart Levine appeared on the Today showto discuss his book The Six Fundamentals of Success, co-host Matt Lauer said to him, &quot;You know what really drives me nuts? When people come into my office for a five-minute conversation and an hour later, they're still there! Why can't they cut to the chase?&quot;Lauer's question echoed the concerns Levine has heard from business people and top executives at every level: How can I get more done? How can I stay focused? How can I condense my workday so that I can become more successful and still spend more time with the people I love? Levine's answer? By cutting to the chase. Successful individuals are the ones who make the best use of their time and energy. They approach each task with clarity, focus, and purpose. They prioritize. They don't allow others to waste their time. They understand the importance of refueling their batteries outside of work. In Cut to the Chase, Levine distills the expertise of hundreds of CEOs, leaders, and professionals into 100 concise, invaluable lessons about how to get to the point, stay on track, and be more successful in everything you do.In an age where we spend more hours at work than ever before, Cut to the Chase is the indispensable guide for taking control over your time so that you can lead a happier, more balanced life.Time Management, Interpersonal RelationsCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Six Fundamentals Of Success: The Rules For Getting It Right For Yourself And Your Organizationby Levine, Stuart R.Everyone has his or her own style at work. But if you look at the people who are successful, you ll see similarities. They always do the most important things first--they know how to prioritize. They can sum up how their company stands out from the pack in only a few minutes. They work with a sense of urgency, every day. These are the kinds of qualities and habits that never go out of style. Moreover, they are crucial to any successful career and life. By pursuing them regularly, you and your company are more likely to get ahead.In The Six Fundamentals of Success, CEO and business consultant Stuart Levine spells out exactly how to practice the constants of business success--whether it's satisfying customers, developing strong relationships, or communicating clearly--through six fundamental principles, gained from decades of experience working with top executives. But it's the way Levine zeroes in on these fundamentals--add value,communicate well, deliver results, act with integrity, invest in relationships, andgain perspective--and brings them to life through dozens of pithy, to-the-point rules that makes the book so practical and useful. With no-nonsense lessons like  Face time counts,   Do breakfast,  and  Share the good news--and the bad,  Levine offers concrete examples of how to behave, respond, and motivate others. Aimed at business people and entrepreneurs at all levels, whether they work in companies large or small,The Six Fundamentals of Success provides the smart, action-oriented guidance people need in today's challenging climate.This new, revised edition includes material on how to assess your personal and team fundamentals IQ as well as information and worksheets to help you strengthen and inspire your fundamentals skills.Industrial ManagementCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
