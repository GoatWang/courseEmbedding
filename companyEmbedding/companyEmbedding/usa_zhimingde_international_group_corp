	FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS: NO ASSURANCES INTENDED





	 




	This
	Report contains certain forward-looking statements regarding USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation, its business and financial
	prospects. These statements represent Management’s best estimate of what will happen. Nevertheless, there are numerous risks
	and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ dramatically from the results suggested in this Report. Among
	the more significant risks are:




	 








	●




	We
	have no business operations and have no assets. Unless the Company obtains additional
	capital or acquires an operating company, the Company will not be able to undertake significant
	business activities.






	 








	●




	The
	Company’s business plan contemplates that it will acquire an operating company
	in exchange for common stock. If that occurs, management will determine the nature of
	the company that is acquired, which is likely to be a company with which management has
	a pre-existing relationship. Investors in the Company will have to rely on the business
	acumen of management in determining that the acquisition is in the best interest of the
	Company. If management lacks sufficient skill to operate successfully, the Company’s
	shares may lose value.






	 




	Because
	these and other risks may cause the Company’s actual results to differ from those anticipated by Management, the reader
	should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that appear in this Report.




	 










	PART
	1






	 









	Item
	1. Business





	 




	USA
	Zhimingde International Group Corporation (the “Company”) was originally incorporated on July 26, 1990 in accordance
	with the laws of the State of Florida as Marketing Educational Corp. On June 13, 2006, the Company was reincorporated by merger
	in the State of Nevada.




	 




	The
	Company was originally formed for the purpose of direct marketing of certain educational materials and photography packages. The
	educational materials marketed by the Company consisted of encyclopedias, learning books, educational audio and video tapes which
	were designed to be used in various combinations to accommodate the educational levels and needs of families with children of
	all ages. During 1991, the Company completed a public offering of 150,000 units of common stock, through a Registration Statement
	on Form S-18 (Registration No.33-37039-A).




	 




	The
	Company has had no operations since 1992 and is currently a “shell company” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
	Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
	The Company is defined as a shell company because it has no operations or assets.




	 













	 







	 





	 




	On
	December 7, 2012, USA Zhimingde International Group Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Zhimingde Inc.”) purchased 1,687,502
	shares of the Company’s common stock from Halter Financial Investments, L.P., Glenn A. Little and The Halter Group, Inc.
	pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase”). Following the Purchase, Zhimingde Inc. owned approximately
	91% of the voting securities of the Company. The Purchase resulted in a change in control of the Company. Subsequently, the Company
	changed its name to USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation effective on February 4, 2013.




	 




	For
	some period of time the Company has been exploring business opportunities that would involve the use of the Company as a shell
	in a reverse merger transaction, in which an operating company would be merged into USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation
	in exchange for shares of our capital stock. We continue to explore business opportunities, particularly businesses with which
	our Chairman, Zhongquan Zou, has experience. The business that we ultimately pursue will be determined by Mr. Zou, who is the
	sole member of our Board of Directors. His decision will be based on the prospects for the business, the availability of capital
	to fund the business, and the potential benefits of the business to the shareholders of USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation.




	 




	It
	is likely that we will effectuate a business combination with a target whose business operations and place of formation are located
	in the People’s Republic of China. In particular, we may combine with one or more entities that Mr. Zou owns or controls.
	In such event, we may face the significant additional risks associated with doing business in that country. In addition to the
	language barriers, different presentations of financial information, different business practices, and other cultural differences
	and barriers that may make it difficult to evaluate such a merger target, we may encounter ongoing business risks associated with
	uncertain legal systems and applications of law, uncertain economic policies and potential political and economic instability.




	 




	Employees




	 




	We
	currently have no employees. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether
	or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.

	Management’s

	Results
	of Operations





	 




	We
	currently have no assets and no operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we realized no revenue and incurred $46,003
	in operating expenses, resulting in a loss from operations and net loss in that amount. During the year ended December 31, 2015,
	we realized no revenue and incurred $53,323 in operating expenses, resulting in a loss from operations and a net loss in that
	amount. The expenses in these years represent the costs of maintaining the Company as an SEC reporting company, as well as expenses
	related to maintaining the Company’s corporate existence. Our expenses were greater in 2015 because, during the first quarter
	of 2015, we filed with the SEC our annual and quarterly reports for all periods from the second quarter of 2013 through the third
	quarter of 2014, and incurred the expenses related to those filings. We now plan to stay current in our filing obligations, and
	do not expect to replicate the level of those expenses until we acquire an operating business.




	 




	Our
	major expenses consisted of fees to lawyers and auditors necessary to maintain our standing as a fully-reporting public company
	and other administrative expenses attendant to the trading of our common stock. We do not expect any significant change in the
	level of these expenses, unless the Company acquires or initiates business operations.

	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources




	 




	At
	December 31, 2016 we had a working capital deficit of $130,832, as we had no assets and had $130,832 in accrued expenses. Our
	liabilities consist of amounts payable to our professional advisors for services, which increased by $26,292 during 2016. The
	remainder of our $40,003 in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 were paid by USA Zhimingde International
	Group Inc., which is our majority shareholder, or by affiliates of that entity. We expect our working capital deficit to continue
	indefinitely, until we initiate or obtain an operating company capable of funding our overhead expenses.




	 




	Our
	operations used no cash during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we increased our accrued expenses by $26,292 during that period
	and the remainder of our expenses were paid by our majority shareholder as a capital contribution. In the future, unless we achieve
	the financial and/or operational wherewithal to sustain our operations, it is likely that we will continue to rely on loans and
	capital contributions to sustain our operations.




	 




	Mr.
	Zou, our Chief Executive Officer, who controls the majority shareholder, or other entities that he controls have financed our
	operations by making capital contributions to cover our expenses. We expect that Mr. Zou’s controlled affiliates will continue
	to fund our operations until we have completed an acquisition of an operating company, and that we will continue to require additional
	capital contributions or financing to maintain our existence as a shell company for the next twelve months, if necessary.  Our
	management is not required to fund our operations by any contract or other obligation.




	 




	Application
	of Critical Accounting Policies




	 




	Our
	financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective
	interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported.
	These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding
	contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP
	and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
	that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
	assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.




	 




	Our
	significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies
	impact our financial condition and results of operations, the Company views certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined
	to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on the Company’s financial statements and require
	management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Among our critical policies is the determination, described in Note
	5 to our financial statements, that the Company should record a valuation allowance for the full value of the deferred tax asset
	created by the net operating loss carryforwards. The primary reason for the determination was the lack of certainty as to whether
	the Company will achieve profitable operations in the future and be able to utilize their carryforwards.




	 












	5

	 







	 





	 




	Actual
	results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that
	applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause any effects on our results of operations, financial
	position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition or results of operations.




	 





	Impact
	of Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	There
	have been no recent accounting pronouncements that have had, or are expected to have, a material effect on our financial statements.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	The Board of Directors and 


	Stockholders of USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance
	sheets of USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the
	related statements of operations, change in stockholders’ (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two year
	period ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
	we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
	financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
	audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
	financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period
	ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements
	as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
	As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has no viable operations or significant assets and
	is dependent upon its major stockholder to provide sufficient working capital to maintain the integrity of the corporate entity.
	These conditions and the Company’s lack of equity and viable operations, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 6. The accompanying
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not
	modified with respect to this matter.

	GENERAL





	 



	Organization and Business
	Nature



	 


	USA Zhimingde International
	Group Corporation (formerly, Marketing Acquisition Corporation) (the “Company”) was incorporated on July 26, 1990 in
	accordance with the laws of the State of Florida as Marketing Educational Corp. On June 13, 2006, the Company was reincorporated
	by merger in the State of Nevada.


	 


	The Company was originally formed
	for the purpose of direct marketing of certain educational materials and photography packages. During 1991, the Company completed
	a public offering of 150,000 units of common stock, through a Registration Statement on Form S-18 (Registration No.33-37039-A).


	 


	The Company has had no operations
	since 1992 and is currently a “shell company” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities
	Act”) and Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Company is defined as a
	shell company because it has no operations or assets.


	 


	On December 7, 2012, USA Zhimingde
	International Group Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Zhimingde Inc.”) purchased 1,687,502 shares of the Company’s
	common stock from Halter Financial Investments, L.P., Glenn A. Little and The Halter Group, Inc. pursuant to a Securities Purchase
	Agreement (the “Purchase”). Following the Purchase, Zhimingde Inc. owned approximately 91% of the voting securities
	of the Company. The Purchase resulted in a change in control of the Company. Subsequently, the Company changed its name to USA
	Zhimingde International Group Corporation, effective on February 4, 2013.

	ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 



	Basis of Accounting and Presentation



	 


	The accompanying financial statements
	have been prepared using the accrual basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly
	liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31,
	2016 and 2015, the Company does not have any cash or cash equivalents.

	ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)





	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial
	statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could
	differ from these estimates.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income
	taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	Section 740, “

	Income Taxes

	” (“ASC 740”), which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes
	for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax
	assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible
	when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses that
	are available to offset future taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
	assets to the amount expected to be realized.


	 


	The Company accounts for uncertain
	tax positions in accordance with ASC Section 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial
	statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The guidance also prescribes
	direction on de-recognition, classification, and accounting for interest and payables in the financial statements. The Company
	classifies interest expense and any related penalties related to income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense.
	No interest or penalties have been recognized as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not expect any significant changes
	in unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date.

	2.






	ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	(CONTINUED)






	 



	Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share



	 


	The Company computes net income
	(loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “

	Earnings per Share

	” (“ASC 260”). 
	Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common
	stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted income per common
	share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
	outstanding plus the effect of any dilutive shares outstanding during the period.  Potential dilutive shares are not included
	when the Company has a loss because their inclusion would be antidilutive. Accordingly, the number of weighted average shares outstanding,
	as well as the amount of net (loss) per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations for the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015, reflected in the accompanying statements of operation. There were no dilutive shares outstanding during the
	year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company measures the fair
	value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820 “

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	”
	which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as
	the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
	market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes
	a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
	inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows:


	 






	●


	Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities




	 






	●


	Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.




	 






	●


	Level 3 - inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value markets.




	 


	The Company did not identify
	any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented at fair value on a recurring basis. Carrying values of non-derivative
	financial instruments, including accrued expenses, approximated its fair value due to the short maturity of these financial instruments.
	There were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented.

	RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS






	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses
	the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain
	debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain
	insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption
	must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated
	statement of cash flows.


	 


	In April, 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which is an amendment
	to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the aspects of identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementing guidance, while
	retaining the related principles within those areas. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record
	a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified
	as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new
	standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into
	after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
	available. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In November 2015, the FASB issued
	ASU No. 2015-17

	,

	Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies
	the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance
	sheet. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

	INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)






	 


	At December 31, 2016, the Company
	had approximately $364,000 of federal net operating losses that may be available to offset future taxable income. The Federal net
	operating loss carryover, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2026. Through 2036, the amount and utilization of any future
	net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to limitations set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. Based upon an analysis
	of the Company’s stock ownership activity through December 31, 2012, a change of ownership was deemed to have occurred in
	2012. This change of ownership created an annual limitation of substantially all of the Company’s net operating losses which
	are available through 2031.


	 


	The Company assesses the likelihood
	that deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is established.
	Based upon the Company’s losses since inception, management believes that it is more likely than not that future benefit
	of the deferred tax asset will not be realized principally due to the continuing losses from operations and the change of ownership
	limitations and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $19,300 and $22,400
	during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	The tax years ended December
	31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 remain open to examination by the taxing authorities.


	 








	6.






	Going concern






	 


	The Company has not generated
	any revenue, nor any significant operations during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not have any assets
	as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency and a stockholders’ deficit
	of $130,832. The Company continues to incur losses from operations and has incurred a net loss of approximately $46,000 and $53,000
	during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company’s current
	business plan is to seek an acquisition or merger with a private operating company. However, there can be no assurance that the
	Company will be able to successfully consummate an acquisition or merger with a private operating company or, that the Company
	will identify any debt or equity financing sources to finance a potential acquisition or merger. If unable to obtain financing,
	the Company may be unable to complete its business plan, and would, instead, delay all cash intensive activities. The Company will
	continue to be dependent on additional capital contributions from its major stockholder for cash flow, which may not be available.
	Without necessary cash flow, the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months, or until such time necessary funds could
	be raised.

	(CONTINUED)






	 


	Accordingly, the accompanying

	which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
	in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily
	purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result
	from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure





	 


	Not Applicable



	 











	Item 9A.




	Controls and Procedures





	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures

	.  Our Chief Executive Officer and our only officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) as of December
	31, 2016. The evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls, specifically:


	 






	●


	There are no management controls, as a single person functions as sole officer and sole member of the Board of Directors.




	 






	●


	Having only one individual responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control
	system.




	 






	●


	Most of our accounting functions are outsourced, which limits our ability to assure that our accounting policies are applied
	consistently.




	 


	Based on his evaluation, he concluded that
	the Company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective as of December 31, 2016.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls

	. There
	was no change in internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation described in the preceding paragraph that occurred during the Company’s
	fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting.


	 



	Management’s Report
	on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	Management of the Company
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of December 31, 2016,
	using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) Internal Control – Integrated
	Framework (2013) as a basis for our assessment.


	 


	Because of inherent limitations,
	internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
	to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
	of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
	inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
	to financial statement preparation and presentation.


	 









	19

	 






	 



	 


	A material weakness in
	internal controls is a deficiency in internal control, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the Company’s
	ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
	of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.
	In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, we identified three
	material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses consisted of:


	 


	a.       

	Inadequate
	staffing and supervision within the bookkeeping operations of our company.

	There is only one individual who is responsible
	for bookkeeping functions. This prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system. The inadequate segregation
	of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters
	or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews.


	 


	b.      

	Outsourcing
	the accounting operations of our company

	. Because there is only one person in our administration, we outsource most of the
	accounting functions of our Company to an independent accountant. This accountant is not directly supervised by the Company’s
	management. This is a material weakness because it could result in differences between the accounting policies adopted by our Board
	of Directors and the accounting practices applied by the accountant.


	 


	c.       

	Lack
	of independent control over related party transactions.

	Zhongquan Zou is the sole director and sole officer of USA Zhimingde
	International Group Corporation. From time to time Mr. Zou or one of his affiliates will make loans or capital contributions to
	finance the operations of the Company. The absence of other directors or officers to review these transactions is a weakness because
	it could lead to improper classification of such related party transactions.


	 


	Management does not believe
	that the current level of the Company’s operations warrants a remediation of the weaknesses identified in this assessment.
	However, because of the above conditions, management’s assessment is that the Company’s internal controls over financial
	reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	This annual report does
	not include an attestation report from the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
	over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered

	Chief Financial Officer


	 


	 





	 


	Directors hold office until the annual meeting
	of the Company’s stockholders and the election and qualification of their successors. Officers hold office, subject to removal
	at any time by the Board, until the meeting of directors immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders and until their
	successors are appointed and qualified.


	 


	Zhongquan Zou

	.
	Mr. Zou is the founder of Beijing Zhimingde Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates, which are primarily engaged in the manufacture,
	marketing and distribution of certain herbal products in China. He has been the Chairman and President of Beijing Zhimingde Technology
	Co. Ltd. since 2008, the Chairman and President of ZMD Bio-engineering (HK) Group, a corporation incorporated under the laws
	of Hong Kong since 2008, the Chairman and President of ZMD Science and Technology Company Limited, a company incorporated under
	the laws of Hong Kong since 2008, and the Chairman and President of US Zhimingde International Group, LLC, a New York entity
	since 2010. Mr. Zou was the Chairman and General Manager of Jilin Yanbian Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. since 1999. Mr. Zou has
	been Vice President of the Health Care Association of China since 2008, Vice President of the Medicine Quality Management Association
	of China since 2009, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference of Korean

	from Jinlin University in 1997.



	 



	Audit Committee



	 


	The Board of Directors has not appointed
	an Audit Committee. The functions that would be performed by an Audit Committee are performed by the Board of Directors. The Board
	of Directors does not have an “audit committee financial expert,” because there is only one Board member.

	Code of Ethics



	 


	The Company has not adopted a formal code
	of ethics applicable to its executive officers. The Board of Directors has determined that the Company’s financial operations
	are not sufficiently complex to warrant adoption of a formal code of ethics.


	 




	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance




	 


	None of the officers, directors or beneficial
	owners of more than 10% of the Company’s common stock failed to file on a timely basis the reports required by Section 16(a)
	of the Exchange Act during the year ended December 31, 2016.

	The following table sets forth information
	known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of the date of this report by the following:

	owned by a person and the percent ownership of that person, we include shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held
	by that person that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days. We do not, however, include these “issuable”
	shares in the outstanding shares when we compute the percent ownership of any other person.
