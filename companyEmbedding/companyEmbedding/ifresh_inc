NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- iFresh, Inc. (NASDAQ:   IFMK), formerly known as E-Compass Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:   ECAC, ECACU, ECACR), today announced that it consummated its business combination with NYM Holding, Inc. ("NYM"), a fast-growing Asian/Chinese grocery supermarket chain in the north-eastern U.S. providing food and other merchandise hard to find in mainstream grocery stores. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and was approved by a vote of ECAC's shareholders at a special meeting on January 17, 2017. With the closing of the transaction, ECAC reincorporated to Delaware and has been renamed iFresh, Inc. ("iFresh"), and its common shares will trade on NASDAQ under the new symbol "IFMK" beginning on February 13, 2017.








Long Deng, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NYM Holding, Inc., said "We are excited to introduce NYM as a public company, the first publicly-listed Chinese/Asian supermarket chain in the U.S. Our specialty is to bring the freshest foods from farm to table and to make sure our customers enjoy the freshness as much as we do. I am truly proud of our team's dedicated job in cultivating and growing NYM to a vertically-integrated supermarket chain in the Chinese and Asian community during the past two decades. NYM's partnership with E-Compass is a key milestone. Becoming a public company via the business combination revitalizes NYM to the next stage, further fulfilling our dedication in delivering freshness. The additional funds raised through this transaction will be devoted to further accelerate our growth and expand our footprint nationwide, especially in the East Coast. With a wide-recognized brand, a rapidly increasing customer base, and a strategic expansion and integration plan, NYM has many exciting growth opportunities going forward and will create value to our investors."
Richard Xu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of E-Compass Acquisition Corp., said, "NYM has a track record of efficient daily-operation and strategic development. Mr. Long Deng and his team are dedicated in this unique and blooming sector. With their experience and insights, we believe NYM has the potential to revolutionize and upgrade the Chinese/Asian supermarket sector which can generate long-term value to shareholders. NYM is well positioned to capitalize from the growing Chinese/Asian American population, their increasing purchasing capacity, and the integration momentum in its unique market sector. We are thrilled to be part of the next stage in this Company's life cycle and look forward to helping create value for our shareholders."
B Riley & Co. LLC acted as investment banking advisor to ECAC and assisted NYM in obtaining debt financing from KeyBank National Association ("Key Bank").  Cantor Fitzgerald acted as capital market advisor for ECAC.
About NYM Holding, Inc.
NYM is a fast growing Asian/Chinese grocery supermarket chain in the north-eastern U.S. providing fresh food and other merchandise that is hard to find in mainstream grocery stores. Since its start in 1995, NYM has been targeting the Chinese and Asian population in the U.S. with its in-depth cultural knowledge of its target customer's unique consumption habits and high demands in fresh foods. NYM currently has two wholesale facilities and eight retail supermarkets across New York, Massachusetts and Florida, with annual revenue of $131.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.

IFresh, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2017 Financial Results






GlobeNewswire



Jun 30, 2017 8:30 AM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK, June 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iFresh, Inc. ("iFresh" or "the Company") (Nasdaq:IFMK), a leading Asian American grocery supermarket chain and online grocer in the United States, today reported audited financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.  Fiscal 2017 Highlights:  Total net sales decrease of 0.3% to $130.9 million from $131.2 million compared to fiscal 2016 Retail segment net sales decrease of 5.0% to $106.8 million from $112.4 million compared to fiscal 2016 Total wholesale segment net sales increase of 27.7% to $24.1 million from $18.9 million compared to fiscal 2016 Gross margin increase to 21.3% from 20.3% in fiscal 2016 Net income of $1.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $3.6 million or $0.30 in fiscal 2016  Long Deng, Chairman of the board of directors and CEO of iFresh, commented, "We are pleased to see strong results in the competitive environment of fiscal 2017. Retail store sales dipped because of non-recurring interruptions in one of our bigger stores, impacting net income, but net sales remained stable due to robust growth in our wholesale business. Gross margin increased due to improved efficiencies in our procurement system, and our cash position is strong. We are also proud of our public listing through the business combination with E-Compass Acquisition Corporation. While this impacted net income through a significant increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, becoming a publicly listed company adds tremendous intangible value to our brand. We look forward to carrying this momentum through fiscal 2018, during which we will continue to drive growth by refining our vertically-integrated model, expanding our store presence along the I-95 corridor, and further promoting our online and mobile platforms to reach more customers. We expect to have a promising future ahead as we gain importance in a niche market and evolve to become a major player. We look forward to sharing our progress with our investors in the coming months ahead."

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
