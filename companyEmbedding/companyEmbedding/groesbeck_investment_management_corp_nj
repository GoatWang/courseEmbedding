ABOUT OUR FIRM 
Groesbeck
  Investment Management Corporation is an employee-owned, SEC registered
  investment adviser, providing equity portfolio management services to
  endowments, foundations, pension plans, trusts, Taft-Hartley accounts, IRA’s
  and high net worth individuals.  Since our founding in 1993, we’ve
  provided above-market investment performance through a disciplined,
  risk-sensitive process.  
OUR INVESTMENT STYLES
Groesbeck
  Investment Management offers two distinct equity portfolio management
  investment strategies depending on the client’s requirements and
  objectives.  Our Growth of Income style seeks to provide a
  growing stream of current income and a total return in excess of the S&P
  500.  Our Growth style seeks to generate higher than market
  returns, primarily through capital appreciation.  The investment
  processes of these two portfolio management strategies are summarized below.
GROWTH OF INCOME STRATEGY
Our
  philosophy toward growth of income investing is to seek above-market
  portfolio returns through investment in securities of companies that our
  analysis indicates have the ability to increase earnings and dividends at a
  faster rate than their industry group and/or the stock market.  We
  construct diversified portfolios of stocks that include both growth and
  income characteristics.  The inclusion of high-yielding growth equity
  issues allows us to invest in growth-oriented stocks at lower dividend yields
  and still obtain an overall portfolio income yield that is well above that of
  the general stock market.  In addition, this process leads to dividend
  income growth that is faster than that of corporate dividend growth in
  general and is significantly faster than the consumer price inflation rate.
We
  start with higher-than-market yield and stress growth of portfolio income at
  a rate faster than that of the market averages.  Portfolio income growth
  is accomplished in two ways.  First, we select companies that should
  experience relatively rapid dividend growth rates and target companies that
  we believe will increase dividends every year.  Second, we augment this
  growing stream of income by periodically switching from lower yielding
  equities to higher yielding issues in order to raise the portfolio income
  level.  In this manner, we can increase the income while also moving
  from relatively overvalued (lower yield) to relatively undervalued (higher
  yield) issues.
GROWTH STRATEGY
Our
  approach toward growth investing is to select the stocks of companies which
  we believe have above-average earnings growth
  prospects.  We purchase the stocks of companies whose future earnings
  growth is estimated to be at least 10% annually.  Companies selected
  must meet our standards for financial strength, profitability and
  sustainability of future growth.  We pay particular attention to revenue
  growth, because we believe the only sustainable growth comes from increased
  revenues, rather than simply through profit margin improvement.  As part
  of the valuation process, stock purchases are made at price/earnings ratios that
  bear a reasonable relationship to the anticipated future rate of earnings
  growth.  The ratio of stock price to trailing twelve month revenues per
  share is also part of our analysis.
Once
  a growth portfolio is constructed, we continuously monitor the earnings progress
  of each company in the portfolio.  Companies that fail to meet our
  earnings growth expectations will normally be sold and replaced with stocks
  that meet our investment criteria.  We believe that successful growth
  investing requires a portfolio earnings stream that is growing at
  above-market rates.  By constantly pruning those issues that fail to
  meet our expectations, the portfolio will remain vibrant and should
  experience satisfactory earnings growth over the long term.
At
  Groesbeck, you will find us to be client friendly, flexible and devoted to
  our investment discipline.  We work closely with our clients, understand
  their investment objectives, and strive to produce results which exceed their
  expectations.

  1% per year, depending on account size. Over a period of five years, the
  maximum 1% advisory fee may result in a compounded effect of 1% per annum or

This composite (created 4/1/03) represents the total return
  for all portfolios managed by Groesbeck Investment Management (GIM) in a
  managed accounts program using our growth of income style. GIM is an SEC
  registered investment advisor that invests primarily in U.S.-based securities
  and is not affiliated with any parent organization. Performance includes
  reinvestment of dividends and is calculated in U.S. dollars. Since Jan.1,
  1994, composites have been valued monthly and portfolio returns have been
  weighted by using beginning-of-month market values. Prior to April 1, 2003,
  the composite consisted of a non-managed accounts growth of income composite,
  valued at $122 million (3/31/03), and included all accounts of $500,000 or
  greater with a Growth of Income investment objective. This composite is still
  managed by GIM separate from the Managed Accounts Composite. It has assets of
  $13.3 million (3/31/17) and represents 8.9% of total firm assets. The
  performance calculations do not reflect the deduction of advisory and other
  fees, which could reduce reported returns in a managed
  accounts composite by up to 3% per year.  GIM
  claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) and
  has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards.
  GIM has not been independently verified.
The
  composite includes the following: # of portfolios; annual standard deviation;
  composite market value at year end; % of total firm assets represented by the
  composite. Note: dispersion is not statistically meaningful (NMF) when there
  are fewer than 5 portfolios in a composite for the entire year. (#,s,$M,%) 2007: #2484, 0.62s, $705.3, 73.0%; 2008 #1579.
  1.71s, $305.7, 66.5%; 2009: #501, 3.53s, $144.5, 45.9%; 2010: #309, 0.28s,

  deviation presented is an asset - weighted calculation of performance
  dispersion for accounts in the composite for the entire year. Past
  performance is no indication of future results. A complete list and
  description of firm composites will be made available upon request.

  returns is available upon request.

  fee.

ABOUT OUR FIRM 
Groesbeck
  Investment Management Corporation is an employee-owned, SEC registered
  investment adviser, providing equity portfolio management services to
  endowments, foundations, pension plans, trusts, Taft-Hartley accounts, IRA’s
  and high net worth individuals.  Since our founding in 1993, we’ve
  provided above-market investment performance through a disciplined,
  risk-sensitive process.  
OUR INVESTMENT STYLES
Groesbeck
  Investment Management offers two distinct equity portfolio management
  investment strategies depending on the client’s requirements and
  objectives.  Our Growth of Income style seeks to provide a
  growing stream of current income and a total return in excess of the S&P
  500.  Our Growth style seeks to generate higher than market
  returns, primarily through capital appreciation.  The investment
  processes of these two portfolio management strategies are summarized below.
GROWTH OF INCOME STRATEGY
Our
  philosophy toward growth of income investing is to seek above-market
  portfolio returns through investment in securities of companies that our
  analysis indicates have the ability to increase earnings and dividends at a
  faster rate than their industry group and/or the stock market.  We
  construct diversified portfolios of stocks that include both growth and
  income characteristics.  The inclusion of high-yielding growth equity
  issues allows us to invest in growth-oriented stocks at lower dividend yields
  and still obtain an overall portfolio income yield that is well above that of
  the general stock market.  In addition, this process leads to dividend
  income growth that is faster than that of corporate dividend growth in
  general and is significantly faster than the consumer price inflation rate.
We
  start with higher-than-market yield and stress growth of portfolio income at
  a rate faster than that of the market averages.  Portfolio income growth
  is accomplished in two ways.  First, we select companies that should
  experience relatively rapid dividend growth rates and target companies that
  we believe will increase dividends every year.  Second, we augment this
  growing stream of income by periodically switching from lower yielding
  equities to higher yielding issues in order to raise the portfolio income
  level.  In this manner, we can increase the income while also moving
  from relatively overvalued (lower yield) to relatively undervalued (higher
  yield) issues.
GROWTH STRATEGY
Our
  approach toward growth investing is to select the stocks of companies which
  we believe have above-average earnings growth
  prospects.  We purchase the stocks of companies whose future earnings
  growth is estimated to be at least 10% annually.  Companies selected
  must meet our standards for financial strength, profitability and
  sustainability of future growth.  We pay particular attention to revenue
  growth, because we believe the only sustainable growth comes from increased
  revenues, rather than simply through profit margin improvement.  As part
  of the valuation process, stock purchases are made at price/earnings ratios that
  bear a reasonable relationship to the anticipated future rate of earnings
  growth.  The ratio of stock price to trailing twelve month revenues per
  share is also part of our analysis.
Once
  a growth portfolio is constructed, we continuously monitor the earnings progress
  of each company in the portfolio.  Companies that fail to meet our
  earnings growth expectations will normally be sold and replaced with stocks
  that meet our investment criteria.  We believe that successful growth
  investing requires a portfolio earnings stream that is growing at
  above-market rates.  By constantly pruning those issues that fail to
  meet our expectations, the portfolio will remain vibrant and should
  experience satisfactory earnings growth over the long term.
At
  Groesbeck, you will find us to be client friendly, flexible and devoted to
  our investment discipline.  We work closely with our clients, understand
  their investment objectives, and strive to produce results which exceed their
  expectations.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NCR (NASDAQ:NCR CORP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Investment Strategy
    and Portfolio Construction




 





    Our investment management services are predicated on our belief that the most
    reliable methods of fundamental research are based on facts rather than
    forecasts.  We pay close attention to a companys revenues, trailing
    earnings from operations, dividends, return on equity, and balance
    sheet.  To us, forecasted earnings by Wall Street are only opinions;
    dividends and reported operating earnings are facts.
STOCK SELECTION
The
    key to producing strong returns begins with stock selection. At Groesbeck,
    we use a variety of sources to conduct stock research and generate
    investment ideas.  Electronic research is conducted through use of the
    Internet, computer screening of financial databases, and a variety of
    websites devoted to the stock market and equity research. In addition, we
    use the equity research web capabilities of some Wall Street brokerage
    houses. We do our own homework on securities under consideration and those
    already owned. 
In looking for investment candidates, we focus on the
    equity securities of companies that have the following characteristics:

Strong sales and earnings growth 
Consistent annual growth trends  
Sound balance sheets 
High returns on equity 
Good long-term financial track records 
Market leadership with growing market share
High trading liquidity 
Reasonable valuations on an absolute and relative
         basis 


PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
    & MAINTENANCE
Once we have
    found stocks that meet our investment criteria, we then build fully
    invested portfolios consisting of 30 to 40 stocks, diversified across a
    broad spectrum of industries. Positions are routinely rebalanced in order
    to prevent any one position from becoming top heavy. Moreover, we also trim
    positions as they become fully valued and seek to replace them with more
    moderately valued stocks.  By continually monitoring portfolios and
    constantly seeking new stock ideas, we create portfolios that remain
    vibrant.  At Groesbeck, we do not engage in any fad investing,
    short-term trading, market timing, derivatives, or short selling.

SELL DISCIPLINE
Just as stock
    selection and sound portfolio maintenance are necessary to achieve strong
    returns, a sell discipline is equally important. In monitoring our clients
    portfolios, we sell stocks that exhibit the following characteristics: 

Slowing sales growth and earnings growth
Poor earnings prospects 
Declining margins 
Diminishing fundamentals 
Slowing dividend growth or reduction of dividends 
Overvaluation 

  
In summary, our
    disciplined approach assures that we remain fully invested and that we seek
    to own quality companies whose earnings are growing and which should provide
    higher-than-market stock price appreciation over the long haul.  Our
    investment process also results in portfolios with relatively low turnover
    and minimal tax implications.  We remain committed to our investment
    process and to providing excellent client service.
