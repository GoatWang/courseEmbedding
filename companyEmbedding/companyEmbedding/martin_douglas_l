Douglas L. Martin to Join Spectrum Brands as Executive Vice President 
      and Chief Financial Officer on September 1






August 14, 2014 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MIDDLETON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products 
      company with market-leading brands, announced today that Douglas L. 
      Martin, 51, will join the Company on September 1 as Executive Vice 
      President and Chief Financial Officer, reporting to Dave Lumley, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Martin replaces Tony Genito, 
      58, who announced plans in April to leave Spectrum Brands by the end of 
      2014 to return with his family to the Southeast.
    


      Mr. Martin comes to Spectrum Brands from Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL), 
      where he had been Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
      since 2012 as part of a 27-year career with the company. Prior to 
      serving as CFO, Mr. Martin held a number of key financial leadership 
      positions, including Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of 
      Finance – Consumer Group, Vice President of Finance – Office Products 
      Group, Vice President and Treasurer, and Vice President, Tax.
    

      “We’re pleased to welcome Doug to Spectrum Brands at this exciting time 
      in the execution of our global growth strategies,” said Mr. Lumley. 
      “Doug shares our operating philosophy and culture, including the 
      Spectrum Value Model and pay for performance, and understands the 
      importance of cost improvement and shared services. He has a deep 
      consumer products industry knowledge, including experience with many of 
      the same retail customers and channels. Doug was born and raised in the 
      Midwest and was originally with the former Newell company then based in 
      Northern Illinois.”
    

      “I look forward to helping Spectrum Brands continue to grow and prosper 
      in this globally changing, branded consumer goods environment,” said Mr. 
      Martin. “I’m impressed with the Company’s long-term prospects and 
      strategies, its senior management team, and its solid balance sheet and 
      strong and growing free cash flow. On a personal note, my family and I 
      are also excited about returning to our deep roots in the Midwest.”
    

      “I am thrilled to have Doug join the management team at Spectrum 
      Brands,” said David Maura, Chairman of Spectrum Brands. “Doug is a high 
      integrity person who shares my passion for taking Spectrum Brands to the 
      next level. He believes in our ownership/accountability culture and 
      grasps our performance-driven organization. Spectrum Brands’ best days 
      are in front of us, and I look forward to Doug’s contributions to the 
      Company’s bright future.”
    

      A Certified Public Accountant, Mr. Martin began his career with KPMG 
      LLP. He is a graduate of Rockford College in Illinois with a bachelor’s 
      degree in accounting.
