Employees







Hutchinson, William R
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Hutchinson, William R carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Hutchinson, William R currently holds license 9492 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Hutchinson, William R



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Hutchinson, William R



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

BBB Tip: Roofing Contractors


BBB Tip: Contractors (General)



 







BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Hutchinson, William R
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Hutchinson, William R carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Hutchinson, William R



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Hutchinson, William R



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Associated Banc-Corp Announces Appointment of Philip B. Flynn as President and Chief Executive Officer | Business Wire
























































Associated Banc-Corp Announces Appointment of Philip B. Flynn as 
      President and Chief Executive Officer




Associated Elects William R. Hutchinson Chairman of the Board of 
      Directors






November 16, 2009 05:03 PM Eastern Standard Time



GREEN BAY, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Associated Banc-Corp (NASDAQ: ASBC) announced today that its Board of 
      Directors has appointed Philip B. Flynn as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Associated Banc-Corp and a director of Associated Banc-Corp 
      effective December 1, 2009. Flynn will also serve as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer and as a director of Associated Bank, National 
      Association. Flynn replaces Paul S. Beideman who announced his plans to 
      retire from the company earlier this year. Beideman will continue to 
      serve as a member of the Board of Directors and as Chief Executive 
      Officer of Associated Banc-Corp until December 1, 2009.
    


      Prior to joining Associated Banc-Corp, Flynn, 52, has been with Union 
      Bank, San Francisco, since 1980. Most recently, he served as Vice 
      Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Union Bank since March 2005, and 
      a Director since 2004. During his nearly 30-year career with Union Bank, 
      Flynn also held a range of other executive positions, including chief 
      credit officer, head of commercial banking, specialized lending and 
      wholesale banking activities. Notably, Flynn is acknowledged to have 
      assisted Union Bank in navigating through the credit downturn and 
      successfully positioning Union Bank to withstand the current credit 
      difficulties.
    

      Incoming President and Chief Executive Officer Philip B. Flynn said, “I 
      am excited and honored to be selected as Associated Banc-Corp’s 
      President and Chief Executive Officer. I look forward to working with 
      Associated’s Board of Directors, management team and talented team of 
      colleagues as we continue to serve our customers and provide value to 
      our shareholders.”
    

      “Phil brings more than 30 years of proven experience and leadership in 
      the banking industry to Associated,” said Lead Independent Director 
      William R. Hutchinson. “The Board is pleased to have selected such a 
      highly qualified person to assume this leadership role. Phil is widely 
      regarded as a talented, experienced banker who understands how to manage 
      the credit portfolio during tough times, as well as the importance of 
      creating shareholder value through building a strong organization and 
      strong culture.”
    

      The company also announced that the Board of Directors elected William 
      R. Hutchinson as its Chairman effective December 1, 2009, reflecting a 
      best practice in corporate governance to have an independent director as 
      Chairman and recognizing Hutchinson’s many contributions to the board. 
      Hutchinson has been a director of Associated Banc-Corp since April 1994 
      and has served as Lead Independent Director since April 2009.
    

      Flynn will report directly to Associated Banc-Corp’s Board of Directors 
      and his office will be located at the corporate headquarters in Green 
      Bay. The company’s executive committee will report to Flynn.
    

      “These two appointments will provide stability and ongoing strength to 
      the leadership of the company,” said Paul S. Beideman. Beideman will 
      remain at Associated until February 1, 2010.
    

      Associated Banc-Corp, headquartered in Green Bay, Wis., is a diversified 
      bank holding company with total assets of $23 billion. Associated has 
      approximately 300 banking offices serving approximately 160 communities 
      in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. The company offers a full range 
      of traditional banking services and a variety of other financial 
      products and services. More information about Associated Banc-Corp is 
      available at www.associatedbank.com.
