Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

BATON ROUGE, La., June 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bernhard Capital Partners Management, LP ("BCP" or the "Firm"), an energy services focused private equity firm that seeks to create sustainable value by leveraging its founding partners' decades of experience acquiring, operating and growing energy services businesses, today announced that it has closed its debut private equity fund, BCP Energy Services Fund, LP (the "Fund").  Launched in 2014, BCP has raised over $750 million in capital commitments to the Fund and managed co-investments from investors, including public and corporate pension funds, university endowments, family offices, strategic corporate investors, industry executives, as well as an investment by the BCP professionals.








BCP was founded in 2013 by James "Jim" Bernhard, the former Founder, Chairman and CEO of The Shaw Group Inc., Jeff Jenkins, the former COO of Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure, and other executives from Shaw and a team of experienced private equity professionals following the sale of The Shaw Group to Chicago Bridge & Iron Company in February 2013. The Firm focuses on the energy services verticals, including midstream, downstream and power, to meet the growing need for infrastructure in the North American oil and gas market. BCP seeks to invest in energy services companies by partnering with world-class management teams to build and grow successful businesses. 
"We are pleased to have successfully closed our first private equity fund and greatly appreciate the confidence and overwhelming support of our investors," said Jim Bernhard, Partner of BCP. "Our strategy is to invest in North American service companies across the midstream, downstream and power verticals, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the many oil and gas investment opportunities we see on the horizon due to the abundance of oil and gas in North America that must be refined, transported and stored." 
Jeff Jenkins, Partner of BCP, added, "By combining the team's operational expertise and deep industry knowledge, BCP can benefit from opportunities across the energy services spectrum and create significant value in our portfolio companies." 
The fund and its portfolio companies have made 14 proprietary acquisitions across its four established platforms, including three carve-outs from public companies. BCP has attracted world-class management teams and its portfolio companies now employ over 12,000 people. Atlantic‐Pacific Capital served as exclusive global placement agent and Kirkland & Ellis served as legal counsel for the Fund.
About Bernhard Capital Partners Management, LP
Bernhard Capital Partners ("BCP") is an energy services-focused private equity firm established in 2013 by Jim Bernhard, Jeff Jenkins and a team of experienced private-equity professionals. BCP seeks to create sustainable value by leveraging its founding partners' 25 years of experience in acquiring, operating and growing energy-services businesses.

The Direxion Daily Energy Bull and Bear 3X Shares seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the Energy Select Sector Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objectives.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

FACTSPERFORMANCELITERATUREFACTS


Fund Overview
Investment Objective
Highland Energy MLP Fund aims to provide investors with current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in large and mid-cap Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) of domestic midstream energy companies.
Combining the Tax Benefits of MLPs with a Mutual Fund Strategy

Diversification 

Provides access to a portfolio of MLPs and a wide variety of energy industry subsectors and regional areas

Potential Tax and Estate Planning Benefits

Typically all quarterly distributions are considered return of capital
Investors receive a 1099 form rather than individual K-1 forms for each underlying investment
Potential for greater suitability for IRAs/401k’s due to lack of UBTI (unrelated business taxable income), unlike the circumstance when the underlying securities are directly owned

Experienced Management

Supported by a team of energy specialists
Highland has extensive expertise in energy-related investing

Growth, Quality, and Daily Liquidity

Focused on midstream MLPs that are historically not as susceptible to distribution fluctuations as those from variable-pay MLPs
Exposure to North American energy infrastructure expansion

Limited Fund Expenses

Fee cap is set at 1.1%

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1.The Advisor has contractually agreed to limit the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to 1.10% of average daily net assets attributable to any class of the Fund. The Expense Cap will continue through at least January 31, 2018. Total net operating expenses for each class after expense reimbursement and excluding deferred income tax expenses are Class A 8.40%, Class C 9.15% and Class Y 8.15%.
The Fund accrues deferred income tax liability for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments, the distributions received by the Fund on equity securities of master limited partnerships ("MLPs") considered to be return of capital and for any net operating gains. The Fund’s accrued deferred tax liability, if any, is reflected each day in the Fund’s net asset value per share. The Fund’s deferred tax liability, if any, depends upon the Fund’s net investment gains and losses and realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and may vary greatly from year to year depending on the nature of the Fund’s investments, the performance of those investments and general market conditions. Therefore, any estimate of deferred tax liability cannot be reliably predicted from year to year. See "Net Asset Value" in the Fund’s prospectus. Total annual Fund operating expenses/(benefit) including deferred taxes (after expense reimbursement) were (8.23)%, (7.48)%, (7.98)% and (8.48)% for Class A, Class C, Class R and Class Y shares, respectively.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.75%.
Industry Concentration Risk. Because the Fund normally invests at least 80% of the value of its assets in energy and materials companies, the Fund’s performance largely depends on the overall condition of these industries and the Fund is susceptible to economic, political and regulatory risks or other occurrences associated with these industries.
Equity Securities Risk. Equity securities, such as common stocks, are subject to market, economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate.
Short Sales Risk.Short sales that are not made “against-the-box” (as defined under “Description of Principal Investments”) theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.
Derivatives Risk.Derivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivatives also expose the Fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.
Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss, cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise.
Debt Securities Risk.The Fund’s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings. Such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.
Senior Loans Risks.  Investments in senior loans involves risks similar to the risks of high yield debt securities, although senior loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to below investment grade securities
ETF Risk.The price movement of an ETF may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund’s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company.
Non-U.S. Securities Risk. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, expropriation or political or economic instability).
Hedging Risk. Although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful.
Market Risk.The Fund’s share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of its portfolio securities.  Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund.
Portfolio Turnover Risk.High portfolio turnover will increase the Fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains.
Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial institutions.  The risk in lending portfolio securities, as with other extensions of credit, consists of possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower fail financially.
Illiquid and Restricted Securities Risk. The Adviser may not be able to sell illiquid or restricted securities at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss.
Non-Diversification Risk.As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of one or a few issuers than a diversified fund. A non-diversified fund’s investment in fewer issuers may result in the fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results of those issuers. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund.
Management Risk.The Fund relies on Highland’s ability to achieve its investment objective. Highland may be incorrect in its assessment of the intrinsic value of companies whose securities the Fund holds, which may result in a decline in the value of Fund shares.
Risks Related to Current Market Conditions. Recently, domestic and international markets have experienced a period of acute stress starting in the real estate and financial sectors and then moving to other sectors of the world economy. This stress has resulted in unusual and extreme volatility in the equity markets and in the prices of individual stocks.  These market conditions could add to the risk of short-term volatility of the Fund.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
