I had an individual, supposedly trained by PermaCrete, apply their product to the exterior of my house. The job was done so poorly even the building inspector commented on it. This qualified installer then left the state.I called PermaCrete to see what help they could provide as far as what my options are to get this fixed. They would not even return my call.Their attitude, we are not responsible for what our trained installers do. You would think that they would make an effort to ensure that installers, when released on to the public, would know what they are doing.  There are so many good products on the market with people who know what they are doing.There is absolutely no reason to use the PermaCrete product or any of their qualified installers.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
