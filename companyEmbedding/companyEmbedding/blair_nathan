Rheo Blair Supplements: Nathan's Notes On Rheo Blair's Secrets







Following our conversation with Nathan, we now share detailed information he has from extensive notes he took during the hours spent with Rheo on the phone in the early 1970's. We have here his complete program consisting of "secrets" Rheo shared only with his advanced clients.

This will entail two posts describing first the quantity of supplements he used and and a description of each; and, second, the dietary and lifestyle regimen he got from Rheo. There will be more on what Rheo liked to call his "secrets" in the second post, putting it all together to achieve the big results.

So we begin with Nathan's Rheo Blair conversation notes on the quantities he used and his descriptions of many of the supplements.
Much of the information that follows was originally posted by Nathan in the superb forums at IronHistory.com hosted by the Joe Roark. The posts there garnered considerable interest perhaps because there seems often to be a certain mystery and mystique that surrounds Blair and his supplements. The possible reasons for this are: 1. those supplements helped produce such stunning results; 2. his most prized products were available only to his private clients; 3. All of the products were very costly; 4. Blair always talked about his "thousand dollar secrets" which also were available exclusively to his private clientele; and 5. Blair himself was something of a character, an enigma, a mystery. 


Given all of the above a certain lore about him, his products and his overall program has grown since his death and the subsequent demise of his product line. Our goal is to present the facts and clarify the mystique so that all may share in the "secrets" of this pioneering nutritionist who touched so many lives both famous and private.

Please note that you may learn more from our related post What About Those Unusual Rheo Blair Supplements; you may also type the word "supplements" in the Google search box over in the right hand column of this page. Numerous articles on this site will be listed in the Google results which reference the Blair supplements. Our goal here at Rheo H. Blair; The Book is to be a comprehensive, one-stop reference for the life and work of Rheo Blair. We uncover more information information on  Rheo and his supplements everyday most of which is unpublished but which we will share in due course. In the meantime, the information from Nathan provides a solid overview of the Rheo Blair program for someone wanting to improve their physique.

Nathan: 

I begin by posting the total amounts Blair had people use while on the big program, specifically as the plan that I was on, which might have varied for others. Regarding digestive enzymes, I am sure Blair used them to help with digestion of the fats in his program. He was never happy with the enzyme product he had, though, and said so. I have not included the enzyme product among the descriptions of Blair products below as I don't know the exact composition of that product and don't have notes. What I do recall is that the label just said "digestive enzymes" likely some combination of bromelain, papain, amylase, protease, and tripease. Regarding calories, though, the program was essentially a low carb program to begin with, so although high in calories, most guys did not put on bodyfat with it, you kept the carb grams low, and did not count calories. If you did put on bodyfat with the protein drinks, Blair would do two things: #1- have you cut back more on carbs, and if that did not work, then, #2- have you go to a doctor and be tested for hypothyroidism.He had doctors in California who would receive the data for him to analyze, if needed, as he was not an MD and your local Dr. might decline to give him the results. Some guys would consume up to 6000 calories a day, and still remain muscular, at least by the standards of the day. When bodybuilders were trying to "cut up", Blair had them replace the milk with water in the drinks, and cut the cream in half. They would also use a lot of the amino capsules at that time. But the Digestive Enzymes (and Hydrochloric Acid) were crucial to the proper digestion and assimilation of all this fat and protein.

I have been asked about amounts I used while on the Rheo H. Blair program. Here is exactly what he had me using on the "big" program. I was only on this for a couple of months, as it was all I could afford, but my progress was the best I ever experienced, in every way.  I continued to use his products for many years, and frequently spoke with him, and later Freddy, on the phone, for years after this, as I would phone in my orders. If you were a long term regular Blair student, he would even ship to you on "open account", and allow you to mail a check after you received the products. Naturally I always paid in a timely manner when he did this. The usual reason to have him ship that way was to save time in getting the products if you were low. Keep in mind that the plan shown might not be the same for everyone. At the time I was on this specific program, I was fairly lean and wanted to to gain muscular size and strength, so it would have been biased towards those needs. Note also my own editorial comments at the bottom. Here is the plan, per day, which luckily I wrote down over 30 years ago, and kept:

Vitamin A: 67,500 IU- I was taking one A+D capsule, but most of this, and the D, came from 30 Cod liver oil capsules/day. 
Vitamin D: 4,800 IU- Also mostly from the CLO, but also included in this amount is what was in the Calcium capsules. 
Vitamin E: 1,200 IU- Mixed tocopherols: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta 
Vitamin B-1: 120 mg
Vitamin B-2: 120 mg. 
Vitamin B-3: 600 mg. ( B-3 is Niacin, for anyone unaware) 
Vitamin B-5: 240 mg. (B-5 is Pantothenic Acid) 
Vitamin B-6: 1,300 mg.-B-6 is essential to protein utilization, part of this B-6 was in the digestants 
Vitamin B-12: 12,400 mcg.- this is an enormous amount, but B-12 is only assimilated as a fairly small percentage of intake .
PABA: 120 mg. (ParaAminoBenzoicAcid) 
Folic Acid: 1600 mcg.  
 Choline: 5000 mg. (part of this was from the lecithin capsules mentioned below)
 Inositol: 3500 mg
Biotin: 140 mcg.
 Vitamin C: 6700 mg.- This was from the C-BioPlus product, plus some ascorbic acid tablets 
Citrus Bioflavanoids: 3000 mg.
 Rutin: 500 mg.
 Magnesium: 120 mg., as magnesium aspartate 
Calcium: 1800 mg. as citrate, lactate, gluconate, and carbonate combination
 Zinc: 150 mg.- I did not record what form this was in.
Copper 500 mcg
 Manganese: 30 mg.
 Iodine: 9 x RDA on ALTERNATE days. This was as Iocen, a liquid dulse product.
 Phosphorus: 1160 mg. - this was in the calcium and or protein products. 
Trace minerals: 25 mg
 Betaine HCL: 3470 mg.
 Glutamic Acid HCL: 1860 mg.- contained in the digestant tablets (4-7 of the tablets use per feeding) 
Pepsin: 1000 mg.- contained in the digestant tablets (pepsin is a 2nd stage digestant) 
Protein: 120 grams of protein from the protein powder, exclusive of the protein found in the milk and eggs used to make the  protein drink, and exclusive of any found in food or the liver tablet. Note the 120 grams is the protein only, not the total  weight of the powder used, which was about one cup by volume. I could have used more, as well, but Blair wanted me to use at least this much.
 Liver Extract: 60 per day. These would have contained iron and B-12, but perhaps more importantly, the intrinsic factors found  in liver, which are known to increase endurance.
 Soybro: 30 per day. The defatted tri-germ oil product. This would have naturally contained tocotrienols, octacosanol, and  other plant sterols. 
Crude Wheat Germ Fractions: 30 per day- A defatted whest germ oil product, high in octacosanol, the same as 10 minim  Prometol. Optionally, you could take 60 Soybro per day, and not this product
 Lecithin: At one time, he had me taking 45- 1200 mg. regular lecithin capsules per day. When the later, smaller high potency  lecithin p-c came out, he recommended up to 30-400mg. capsules of that type.
Amino Acids: 15 capsules per day 
 L-Glutamine: 6 grams per day, as 12-500mg. capsules. 
Blair's Free Form Amino Acid Capsules: "As many as you can afford" was his quote. For someone who had unlimited wealth, the number was 60 per day.
 Digestive Enzymes: 4 to 7 per feeding, unfortunately, as previously stated, I did not record what was in these. 
Softone: This was simple psyllium husk. Blair had me use 1-3 teaspoons daily, mixed in water or milk (not in with the protein drink). This is basically a Metamucil like product to help with regularity while on this diet high in dairy products, with little  fiber in it otherwise

Total: 250 capsules/tablets per day.  

IMPORTANT: Blair stated that many of these nutrients should not be taken without others, notably some of the B-Complex. He was using amounts he thought would act synergistically. It would not be wise to merely pick out some of the items listed here, and take those amounts, without the others. It would be wiser to take, for example, 1/4 as much of EVERYTHING, and to use all of it, rather than full doses of only 1/4 of the items listed.

Product descriptions:

BLAIR'S SOYBRO was a tri-germ oil product  from wheat, rice, and soy oils, but it was defatted (Energol -- a Hoffman/York product -- had the same combination of oils, but was not defatted). SOYBRO was made by a company called Professional Labs, located in Iowa. The idea of a defatted oil may not sound possible at first, but what was removed was the heavy lipids, leaving, and thus concentrating, the (good ) octacosanol, tocotrienols, and so on. I wondered, early on, if SOYBRO was just ENERGOL in capsules, but that was not the case, if you opened one of the SOYBRO capsules, you could tell the difference. Also, when SOYBRO became unavailable after Rheo's death,  Freddy Linblad, Rheo's office manager,  was able to get the liquid which the capsules contained. It was sold under the name SOIMONE, and was from the same lab that had made SOYBRO. They could sell the liquid in relatively small quantities, but they needed an order for a million capsules or so in order to do a day's production run of the capsules. Anyway, the SOIMONE was not oily like ENERGOL, did not stick to your mouth and tongue the way ENERGOL did. Based on the composition of SOYBRO, it would have contained Octacosanol,
 Hexacosanol, Tocotrienols, and Tocopherols, although in fairly
 small amounts, relative to the amount of those needed to have much 
effect on the human body. So taking a few of these a day would not do 
much. Rheo had his advanced students take 30-60 Soybro capsules per day.

BLAIR'S LIVER EXTRACT This was a low temperature freeze dried, defatted, raw liver extract in 



capsule form. It was made, at one time, by a company called Reheis, in Chicago, which has not made it in many years.  Rheo had told me his LIVER EXTRACT required 16-20 lbs. of raw liver to make 1 lb. of finished product, so that would be at least a 16 to 1 concentration.

CRUDE WHEAT GERM FRACTIONS was a defatted wheat germ oil product. Blair did not offer this on his regular price list, but did sell it to his advanced  or private students. It was about three times the price of SOYBRO which was priced at approximately $50./1000 and CWGF being around $150./1000. Today a product called Prometol is the SAME product: same shape, size, and color softget;  same taste, smell, and texture of the product inside.  I am dead certain they are the same thing. They are a product of VIOBIN, and can be found through a lot of the big online vitamin sellers. They are not cheap but you can find them from the discounters for a little under $20/100. Blair suggested 30 per day, so, in 30 days, you would take 900 capsules, or $180. worth of that product alone. Less money, adjusted for inflation, than Blair was selling them for 30 years ago, but still expensive.

BLAIR'S LECITHIN PC- This was really not a special product as such. Blair had used regular lecithin capsules, particularly for students trying to lose weight, and when the Lecithin Phosphotidyl Choline hit the market, he started using that. Up to 45 400mg. capsules per day, on the big program. Rheo said "they make the rest of the plan work better", though he offered no full explanation. These are available a lot of places, referred to as Lecithin PC, or as Triple Strength Lecithin. They are as effective as a 1200mg. capsule of ordinary Lecithin, while having less calories and bulk, and  less to digest. 

Vitamin E- Blair's was a regular generic product, however, he did use the capsules which were MIXED Tocopherols, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, as opposed to the simple d-Alpha tocopherol of many capsules. He had me use 1200 IU per day when I was on the "big" program. 

Vitamin C- Blair's were ordinary ascorbic acid, the common form of C available about everywhere. He had his students use large amounts on the big program. The total amount he had me using at one time was 6 grams per day, others much more.

Bio Plus This was a Bioflavanoid capsule with Vitamin C, similar capsules are available from TwinLab, Swanson, and other suppliers. Blair said this enhanced the uptake of Vitamin C, and helped with workout recovery.

Vitamins A and D Blair had me use fish liver oil capsules to obtain these. At one time, I was using 30 of the small capsules per day. He emphasized the oil should be cold processed. He also said that Vitamin A, in particular, should be from natural sources, not synthetic. He stated that the synthetic form, for whatever reason, was more likely to cause the toxic buildup problems sometimes associated with Vitamin A.

BLAIR'S B-Complex: Each capsule contained 30mg. each of B-1, B-2, and B-3(niacin), and PABA, 75mg. of B-6, 60mg. of Pantothenic Acid, 100 mcg. of B-12, 400 mcg. of Folic Acid, 35 mcg. of Biotin, and some Choline and Inositol. The difference in this product, and most others of its time, was that ALL B-Complex factors were included in it, as opposed to cheaper products which often only had the "numbered" B vitamins. It was a capsule when most of the others were still tablets. Also, when Rheo had these made, he had the amounts of each component adjusted to what he felt were the right proportions, as compared with many products which just had, for example, 25 units (mg. or mcg., whichever applied) of every nutrient, regardless of the actual needs for each. 

BLAIR'S B-12, B-6, NIACIN, AND B-1/ B-2: None of these were anything out of the ordinary, the same chemical compostion as any other brand. The B-1 and B-2 came together in one capsule. BLAIR would have students use extra amounts of one or more of these, depending upon the individual's needs. He had bodybuilders and lifters use huge amounts of B-12 at times (10,000 mcg. or more), due to the fact that the body will uptake a limited % of B-12, but will uptake it in direct proportion to how much is taken. The only B-12 available at the time was cyanocobalamin, I expect Blair would also have been using the methylcobalamin form now available, if he was living. MY guess is he would have combined the two. Extra B-6 was used to help further faciltate protein assimilation, and extra niacin is known to help "distribute" nutrients throughout the body. The B-1 and B-2 capsules were to help provide extra energy. 

BLAIR'S CHOLINE PLUS Blair said to use this only if you were also using the B-COMPLEX as well. I don't know his reason, but expect there was some issue in somehow being "out of balance" if you took it alone. These were Choline and Inositol capsules, 2:1 ratio of the Choline to the Inositol.  Basically, it was a lipotropic (fat loss) product. This product was mentioned in PUMPING IRON (the book), as is Blair's Protein, both on page 60, with Mike Katz and Ed Corney using it. Today's substitute would just be Choline and Inositol capsules, probably separate, in order to achieve the 2:1 ratio. It is a weight loss product the way he used it. I think Rheo also used the amino acid Methionine with students needing to take off fat. If he was around today, I expect he would also be using L-Carnitine, or the Acetyl L-Carntine, and probably Conjugated Linoleic Acid for students needing to lose weight. 

IOCEN This was a liquid iodine product, made from dulse. One would take a few drops on alternate days, and it would provide, in his estimation, all the iodine you would need. 

SOFTONE This was nothing but blond psyllium husks, a bulk fiber product, about the same as Metamucil. Blair had students use it if they had any elimination problems as a result of his program, which was obviously low in fiber.

BLAIR'S CALCIUM PLUS and CALCIUM P-F (phosphorus free): These two calcium products, the only difference being one contained phosphorus, and the other did not, were superior to others on the market in their day. At that time, most calcium products you would see were calcium carbonate tablets, which were very difficult to digest and assimilate. Blair's was in capsule form, and consisted of calcium citrate, lactate, gluconate, and carbonate. They also contained vitamin D, and some HCL to help them be easily digested (in case you were wondering, HCL in its dry form doesn't digest anything until dissolves in liquid, such as in the stomach, which is why it did not digest the capsules while still in the bottle). Calcium carbonate is, and always was, the cheapest and least bioavailable form, so it is generally inferior to the other forms. It makes a good antacid, as it takes so much stomach acid to digest!

BLAIR'S MAGNESIUM Blair was using magnesium aspartate, when all the other formulas were the very inferior magnesium oxide. Today, magnesium asparate, citrate, and orotate are available, and are all good forms. You can find them combined with the calcium in many formulas. 

BLAIR'S ZINC  I don't have notes on this one, but I think he was using either citrate or picolinate, again, when everyone else was offering the cheaper and less assimible oxide form. 

The three minerals listed are here are those Blair considered most important, in particular the calcium. He had students using these often without having them use the other minerals such as his IRON PLUS product. All in all, though, these products were ahead of their time. 

BLAIR'S AMINO ACID CAPSULES These were famous. Many top bodybuilders used these, particularly when they were on restricted diets and trying to get cut for contests. My understanding is that Blair had these formulated to his specifications, which was with the profile of whole eggs. That is, the aminos would be in the same proportions as they would occur in eggs. They were expensive, around $600. per 1000 in the early 70s. I think the peak price on them later was around $1.00 each, and that was during a time frame when money was worth more than it is now. Part of this high price may have been due to low production, and part may have been Blair making a big profit on them. Steve Davis later had these analyzed and was selling a product he said was essentially the same for about 10% of the price Blair was getting. Not 10% less, but 10%, that is, 90% less. At the time Blair was selling his, I don't think there was any other such product on the market, so his were the only option. They did work well, even a few a day seemed to help your general well being.

 Iodine: 9 x RDA on ALTERNATE days. This was as Iocen, a liquid dulse product.
 Phosphorus: 1160 mg. - this was in the calcium and or protein products. 
Trace minerals: 25 mg
 Betaine HCL: 3470 mg.
 Glutamic Acid HCL: 1860 mg.- contained in the digestant tablets (4-7 of the tablets use per feeding) 
Pepsin: 1000 mg.- contained in the digestant tablets (pepsin is a 2nd stage digestant) 
Protein: 120 grams of protein from the protein powder, exclusive of the protein found in the milk and eggs used to make the  protein drink, and exclusive of any found in food or the liver tablet. Note the 120 grams is the protein only, not the total  weight of the powder used, which was about one cup by volume. I could have used more, as well, but Blair wanted me to use at least this much.
 Liver Extract: 60 per day. These would have contained iron and B-12, but perhaps more importantly, the intrinsic factors found  in liver, which are known to increase endurance.
 Soybro: 30 per day. The defatted tri-germ oil product. This would have naturally contained tocotrienols, octacosanol, and  other plant sterols. 
Crude Wheat Germ Fractions: 30 per day- A defatted whest germ oil product, high in octacosanol, the same as 10 minim  Prometol. Optionally, you could take 60 Soybro per day, and not this product
 Lecithin: At one time, he had me taking 45- 1200 mg. regular lecithin capsules per day. When the later, smaller high potency  lecithin p-c came out, he recommended up to 30-400mg. capsules of that type.
Amino Acids: 15 capsules per day 
 L-Glutamine: 6 grams per day, as 12-500mg. capsules. 
Blair's Free Form Amino Acid Capsules: "As many as you can afford" was his quote. For someone who had unlimited wealth, the number was 60 per day.
 Digestive Enzymes: 4 to 7 per feeding, unfortunately, as previously stated, I did not record what was in these. 
Softone: This was simple psyllium husk. Blair had me use 1-3 teaspoons daily, mixed in water or milk (not in with the protein drink). This is basically a Metamucil like product to help with regularity while on this diet high in dairy products, with little  fiber in it otherwise

Total: 250 capsules/tablets per day.  

IMPORTANT: Blair stated that many of these nutrients should not be taken without others, notably some of the B-Complex. He was using amounts he thought would act synergistically. It would not be wise to merely pick out some of the items listed here, and take those amounts, without the others. It would be wiser to take, for example, 1/4 as much of EVERYTHING, and to use all of it, rather than full doses of only 1/4 of the items listed.

Product descriptions:

BLAIR'S SOYBRO was a tri-germ oil product  from wheat, rice, and soy oils, but it was defatted (Energol -- a Hoffman/York product -- had the same combination of oils, but was not defatted). SOYBRO was made by a company called Professional Labs, located in Iowa. The idea of a defatted oil may not sound possible at first, but what was removed was the heavy lipids, leaving, and thus concentrating, the (good ) octacosanol, tocotrienols, and so on. I wondered, early on, if SOYBRO was just ENERGOL in capsules, but that was not the case, if you opened one of the SOYBRO capsules, you could tell the difference. Also, when SOYBRO became unavailable after Rheo's death,  Freddy Linblad, Rheo's office manager,  was able to get the liquid which the capsules contained. It was sold under the name SOIMONE, and was from the same lab that had made SOYBRO. They could sell the liquid in relatively small quantities, but they needed an order for a million capsules or so in order to do a day's production run of the capsules. Anyway, the SOIMONE was not oily like ENERGOL, did not stick to your mouth and tongue the way ENERGOL did. Based on the composition of SOYBRO, it would have contained Octacosanol,
 Hexacosanol, Tocotrienols, and Tocopherols, although in fairly
 small amounts, relative to the amount of those needed to have much 
effect on the human body. So taking a few of these a day would not do 
much. Rheo had his advanced students take 30-60 Soybro capsules per day.

BLAIR'S LIVER EXTRACT This was a low temperature freeze dried, defatted, raw liver extract in 



capsule form. It was made, at one time, by a company called Reheis, in Chicago, which has not made it in many years.  Rheo had told me his LIVER EXTRACT required 16-20 lbs. of raw liver to make 1 lb. of finished product, so that would be at least a 16 to 1 concentration.

CRUDE WHEAT GERM FRACTIONS was a defatted wheat germ oil product. Blair did not offer this on his regular price list, but did sell it to his advanced  or private students. It was about three times the price of SOYBRO which was priced at approximately $50./1000 and CWGF being around $150./1000. Today a product called Prometol is the SAME product: same shape, size, and color softget;  same taste, smell, and texture of the product inside.  I am dead certain they are the same thing. They are a product of VIOBIN, and can be found through a lot of the big online vitamin sellers. They are not cheap but you can find them from the discounters for a little under $20/100. Blair suggested 30 per day, so, in 30 days, you would take 900 capsules, or $180. worth of that product alone. Less money, adjusted for inflation, than Blair was selling them for 30 years ago, but still expensive.

BLAIR'S LECITHIN PC- This was really not a special product as such. Blair had used regular lecithin capsules, particularly for students trying to lose weight, and when the Lecithin Phosphotidyl Choline hit the market, he started using that. Up to 45 400mg. capsules per day, on the big program. Rheo said "they make the rest of the plan work better", though he offered no full explanation. These are available a lot of places, referred to as Lecithin PC, or as Triple Strength Lecithin. They are as effective as a 1200mg. capsule of ordinary Lecithin, while having less calories and bulk, and  less to digest. 

Vitamin E- Blair's was a regular generic product, however, he did use the capsules which were MIXED Tocopherols, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, as opposed to the simple d-Alpha tocopherol of many capsules. He had me use 1200 IU per day when I was on the "big" program. 

Vitamin C- Blair's were ordinary ascorbic acid, the common form of C available about everywhere. He had his students use large amounts on the big program. The total amount he had me using at one time was 6 grams per day, others much more.

Bio Plus This was a Bioflavanoid capsule with Vitamin C, similar capsules are available from TwinLab, Swanson, and other suppliers. Blair said this enhanced the uptake of Vitamin C, and helped with workout recovery.

Vitamins A and D Blair had me use fish liver oil capsules to obtain these. At one time, I was using 30 of the small capsules per day. He emphasized the oil should be cold processed. He also said that Vitamin A, in particular, should be from natural sources, not synthetic. He stated that the synthetic form, for whatever reason, was more likely to cause the toxic buildup problems sometimes associated with Vitamin A.

BLAIR'S B-Complex: Each capsule contained 30mg. each of B-1, B-2, and B-3(niacin), and PABA, 75mg. of B-6, 60mg. of Pantothenic Acid, 100 mcg. of B-12, 400 mcg. of Folic Acid, 35 mcg. of Biotin, and some Choline and Inositol. The difference in this product, and most others of its time, was that ALL B-Complex factors were included in it, as opposed to cheaper products which often only had the "numbered" B vitamins. It was a capsule when most of the others were still tablets. Also, when Rheo had these made, he had the amounts of each component adjusted to what he felt were the right proportions, as compared with many products which just had, for example, 25 units (mg. or mcg., whichever applied) of every nutrient, regardless of the actual needs for each. 

BLAIR'S B-12, B-6, NIACIN, AND B-1/ B-2: None of these were anything out of the ordinary, the same chemical compostion as any other brand. The B-1 and B-2 came together in one capsule. BLAIR would have students use extra amounts of one or more of these, depending upon the individual's needs. He had bodybuilders and lifters use huge amounts of B-12 at times (10,000 mcg. or more), due to the fact that the body will uptake a limited % of B-12, but will uptake it in direct proportion to how much is taken. The only B-12 available at the time was cyanocobalamin, I expect Blair would also have been using the methylcobalamin form now available, if he was living. MY guess is he would have combined the two. Extra B-6 was used to help further faciltate protein assimilation, and extra niacin is known to help "distribute" nutrients throughout the body. The B-1 and B-2 capsules were to help provide extra energy. 

BLAIR'S CHOLINE PLUS Blair said to use this only if you were also using the B-COMPLEX as well. I don't know his reason, but expect there was some issue in somehow being "out of balance" if you took it alone. These were Choline and Inositol capsules, 2:1 ratio of the Choline to the Inositol.  Basically, it was a lipotropic (fat loss) product. This product was mentioned in PUMPING IRON (the book), as is Blair's Protein, both on page 60, with Mike Katz and Ed Corney using it. Today's substitute would just be Choline and Inositol capsules, probably separate, in order to achieve the 2:1 ratio. It is a weight loss product the way he used it. I think Rheo also used the amino acid Methionine with students needing to take off fat. If he was around today, I expect he would also be using L-Carnitine, or the Acetyl L-Carntine, and probably Conjugated Linoleic Acid for students needing to lose weight. 

IOCEN This was a liquid iodine product, made from dulse. One would take a few drops on alternate days, and it would provide, in his estimation, all the iodine you would need. 

SOFTONE This was nothing but blond psyllium husks, a bulk fiber product, about the same as Metamucil. Blair had students use it if they had any elimination problems as a result of his program, which was obviously low in fiber.

BLAIR'S CALCIUM PLUS and CALCIUM P-F (phosphorus free): These two calcium products, the only difference being one contained phosphorus, and the other did not, were superior to others on the market in their day. At that time, most calcium products you would see were calcium carbonate tablets, which were very difficult to digest and assimilate. Blair's was in capsule form, and consisted of calcium citrate, lactate, gluconate, and carbonate. They also contained vitamin D, and some HCL to help them be easily digested (in case you were wondering, HCL in its dry form doesn't digest anything until dissolves in liquid, such as in the stomach, which is why it did not digest the capsules while still in the bottle). Calcium carbonate is, and always was, the cheapest and least bioavailable form, so it is generally inferior to the other forms. It makes a good antacid, as it takes so much stomach acid to digest!

BLAIR'S MAGNESIUM Blair was using magnesium aspartate, when all the other formulas were the very inferior magnesium oxide. Today, magnesium asparate, citrate, and orotate are available, and are all good forms. You can find them combined with the calcium in many formulas. 

BLAIR'S ZINC  I don't have notes on this one, but I think he was using either citrate or picolinate, again, when everyone else was offering the cheaper and less assimible oxide form. 

The three minerals listed are here are those Blair considered most important, in particular the calcium. He had students using these often without having them use the other minerals such as his IRON PLUS product. All in all, though, these products were ahead of their time. 

BLAIR'S AMINO ACID CAPSULES These were famous. Many top bodybuilders used these, particularly when they were on restricted diets and trying to get cut for contests. My understanding is that Blair had these formulated to his specifications, which was with the profile of whole eggs. That is, the aminos would be in the same proportions as they would occur in eggs. They were expensive, around $600. per 1000 in the early 70s. I think the peak price on them later was around $1.00 each, and that was during a time frame when money was worth more than it is now. Part of this high price may have been due to low production, and part may have been Blair making a big profit on them. Steve Davis later had these analyzed and was selling a product he said was essentially the same for about 10% of the price Blair was getting. Not 10% less, but 10%, that is, 90% less. At the time Blair was selling his, I don't think there was any other such product on the market, so his were the only option. They did work well, even a few a day seemed to help your general well being.

A Conversation about Rheo Blair, Part II -- Nathan's Experience







In Part I of our conversation about his experience with Rheo Blair, we met Nathan, a "distance" student of Rheo Blair's back in the 60's 70's and 80's.

We learned how he heard about Rheo and of his initial, modest Blair program.He had tried other lines, Weider, Hoffman, etc but eventually chose Blair's. We learn why.

And we learn of his second, more intense Blair program, including his views on some of Blair's products.






 Charles: Let's clarify what the issues were in your mind at that time regarding the choice between the Weider products and the Blair products. You say that Weider claimed superiority for his products?






Nathan: Yes. Certain non-Blair products were so highly touted in the magazines of protein manufacturers, not only in ads, but in text, that an impressionable kid had to believe they were the best. By them being touted in text, what I mean is that most articles about a successful bodybuilder of the time would often include that bodybuilder testifying that he owed much of his success to, for example, Weider products. Initially they tasted awful but as time went on, with more sugar added, they tasted better.  But at what cost to nutritional quality? 
I recall a product named “Super Pro 101”, a canned, liquid product, which listed as its first ingredient: corn syrup. I liked the vanilla flavor, but the 30 grams of protein (later they claimed as much as 40) derived from it was at the expense of one having to also ingest a lot of empty and harmful sugar calories. Another one I remember well was “Crash Weight #7, “ I believe it was made of confectionery sugar, flavoring, and casein. Claims for it were up to a pound a day of weight gain, but even though I mixed it with things like ice cream, bananas, pineapple, raw eggs, and lots of milk, I still did not gain much weight on it. Probably just as well, because if I had gained weight, it would have probably been mostly fat. 
Charles: So you're saying there was lots of sugar, empty calories, and not much in the way of results. Those are words no one would ever use about Rheo Blair! And didn't Weider also sell protein tablets? 


Nathan: Yes. And here we go again: Weiders' protein tablets consisted of, I think, soy protein, probably some sugar, and flavoring, Those did have bromelain in them to assist with digestion, but I am not sure if there was actually enough to do much good, at least for me. On the other hand, Weider's BD/BU (Break Down/Build Up), was a fairly good product which included bioflavanoids and vitamin C. And everyone at that time sold the ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C since the more exotic versions like  ester C and some mineral bound forms of C were not yet available.  But with most other ingredients, Blair chose the best quality ingredients at the highest therapeutic level per serving regardless of cost; and no sugar, ever. Let me give you an example: if calcium carbonate was cheap, and calcium citrate expensive,  Blair would choose the calcium citrate at a high dose level while the others might chose the carbonate at a lower dose level while still charging a high price. So regardless of your out-of-pocket cost, Blairs was ALWAYS the better value and most important of all - you got results! Blair's commitment to results also extended to the form in which the supplement came: he chose, for example,  the more expensive and more bio-available capsule format whenever available/possible while others defaulted to the cheaper tablet format which did not always break down or at least did not do so consistently.  
And let's get back to the core ingredients. The protein powders Weider and others sold were soy-based which is bad enough BUT it was also grainy and hard to mix adding insult to injury. This was where Blair's milk and egg protein was so clearly superior -- far more nutritious and easier to assimilate of course, but also easier to mix, and better tasting, particularly with the esther based flavorings he sold. To clarify, Blair himself initially sold a soy powder product (and was quickly copied and out-marketed by others). But Blair always was looking for better nutritional options for


 himself and his clients. Therefore, when he found out that soy had real problems with indigestibility and was an incomplete protein and therefore an unbalanced amino acid profile, he quickly dumped soy in favor of milk and egg.  Had he known soy was a goitrogen, he probably would have dumped it sooner as goitrogens can, in those with thyroid issues, disrupt the entire hormonal balance of the body, that very balance being at the core of Blair’s successful theories and results.



Charles: You are too polite about the taste of the non-Blair powders. I tried several of them in the mid-70s before I had heard of Rheo Blair. Those powders tasted vile. And they didn’t help me.  Although I held my nose and drank them religiously I didn't gain a pound. But when I tried Blairs, I couldn't believe how incredibly good it tasted. Blairs' Protein was literally so tasty that it was like something that should be bad for you –but it wasn’t.  And how they worked! Before and after magic.  Bottom line, you can’t build a healthy body with sugar and soy.  Raw organic milk and raw organic eggs DO build healthy bodies. Just ask Weston Price. 

  
Nathan: Yes, my results were certainly not spectacular on the Weider products either, the taste was clearly inferior, and, bottom line, the bodybuilders, in many cases, were not even using them in spite of the fact they appeared in paid advertisements for those same products. Amazing! 

Incidentally, I once had a problem with  the Weider company when it took around 3-4 months to receive a weight training bench which was paid for in advance. It was a lot more difficult in those days to get any consumer protection, and the thing was paid for by check, so nothing like charging back a credit card. The “Weider Research Institute,” as near as anyone can tell, existed in name only, although I did not know that at the time. 

Charles: Rheo didn't always get his orders shipped out promptly, God knows, but it was never anything like 3-4 months and he did do his best with all that was going on around him. We used to joke about everyone at Blair house being on "Blair Time" where the world moved at a more relaxed pace and things just didn't happen in the most efficient manner possible to the casual observer. This was something of an illusion. Truth was, he and his staff were constantly very busy and accomplished more than the average person could ever imagine.

Nathan: Well, my switch from Weider to Blair products was somewhat gradual trying and comparing them to the locally available and less expensive lines. I do wish there had been a local Blair dealer as I could get the others' products nearby and quickly. Blair products were to be found on the West Coast in health food stores, but that was not the case in small towns here on the East Coast.  

And, as I started to get to know a few of the serious bodybuilders, I learned that many of them,  especially if they were drug free, preferred Blair's products to all others, and almost no one had much respect for most other products lines, other than those with some commercial interest in them, such as the store selling them. And then it is also true that some guys I knew by the 70s were steroid users and basically had found that they gained no matter what, so they were not all that particular about what supplements they used.


Charles: Rheo called these latter the 
"easy gainers' and said they could eat practically anything and get big.
 But Rheo made his mark turning hard gainers into successful 
bodybuilders, over time,  and taking easy gainers and doing the same practically overnight.  And of course the steroid question is of huge significance and covered thoroughly by Randy Roach.

Nathan: In
 my case,  though, determined to remain drug free, I felt I should be 
using the  best, and while the change was gradual, by 76-77, I had 
finally dumped Weider and was totally on  Blair's. Also, when I started 
earning more money, around 1977, and Blair  assured me his program would 
get results, that's the way I went. After  many years on various other products with gradual, almost 
indifferent results,  I  finally got the best, most dramatic and impressive
 results ever from Blair's big program.

Charles: OK so shifting away from non-Blair products let's focus on your big Blair program.  Tell us what happened. And this was how long after your first, modest Blair program in 1966?

 Nathan: Well, several years. Fast forward through a late 60's stage of being more interested in things like Bob Dylan music, subculture, and beautiful hippie girls with long straight hair even longer than my own shoulder length hair, to the early 70s, when I went back to the weights it was not because I needed to, but because it was something I missed. Once I was back in the workaday world, and had a full time adult type job, I decided that I could afford the Blair program, and once again contacted Rheo.Charles: Was he happy to hear from you and happy that you were ready to "go big?" 


   
Nathan: Yes, Rheo was very happy that I wanted to get serious both about bodybuilding and about 


doing his big program, and wanted me to come to Hollywood, California for a stay at "Blair House".  While that woud have been by far the best option, I had too many commitments to honor rather than go to California for a stay, and reasoned that  the money that would have gone for airfare, etc. could instead be used for more supplements. So, I never went. I wish I had, though, because I learned years later about some of the things he did there, such as hydrotherapy, massage therapy, etc. 
Charles: Yes, there were huge advantages in the results column of living with him during one's program.

 Nathan: And yet, even at the higher level I was on, my participation was still limited by limited funds, and at $600-700 dollars per month, I was still not on some of the more elite products, and on limited doses of others. I WAS able to use good amounts of the Extra Special Protein, at what was THEN $26/lb., lots of his very unique Soybro, Liver Extract, Lecithin, HCL and B-Complex. Rheo would give me advice on both on how to use these products, and advice on training. He was always very cordial and helpful.  
However, if Rheo did have had a fault,  it was that he either could not, or would not, recognize that I did not have unlimited financial resources.  And yet I was spending a fortune. At the time, what I was spending with him was literally as much as some people in North Carolina, my home at that time, were earning. My "Rheo bill" was more than my house payment and car payment combined! And still he wanted me to spend more.  
Charles: That sounds like Rheo I knew all right! He was 100% dedicated to everyone getting the best results. But yes his program was very costly, and his special "private" products were both extremely costly to produce and virtually impossible to get anywhere else. But for those who had the resources to buy them and use them at the levels Rheo advised,  the results were practically unbelieveable. This is a big reason he went after the Hollywood celebrity crowd; lots of money to spend in pursuit of dramatic results, and, for Rheo, lots of priceless free publicity when they did.  

Nathan: All of that aside, and despite my limited resources, this big program was VERY effective for me.  I was already a somewhat advanced trainee, and I gained probably another 15 lbs. of muscle  in the first 2 months.  Not only did I look better but I also FELT better on the Blair program. Felt like there was no stress in my life, despite the fact that nothing in my life had changed to cause this other than my being on the Blair program. 

Charles: One reason for this is that his program helped support and strengthen the adrenal glands, those endocrines that deal with stress. Adrenal fatigue, a result of too much stress, is a big problem for many people. It sounds like his program helped you in that regard. But there's another point regarding stress and the Blair program. Rheo taught that a certain frame of mind was required  for the best good bodybuilding results: peace and tranquility. Why? Because that state of mind allowed for increased blood flow and thus more nutrients reached the tissues that needed feeding for growth. 
Nathan: Not only did I look and feel better, but my skin tone improved, my energy was up, and there was no longer any shaking when I worked out, even on the final, tough reps of a set.  From that point on, I always ordered Blair's, at whatever level I could afford. Very expensive but worth every penny from my experience.

And so I can say that after many years on various other products with indifferent results, I got the best results ever from Blair's big program. Results, eventually tapered off; that kind of muscle gain cannot be maintained long term.  But cash was ultimately the limting factor, and I had to eventually give up the big program. I continued, however, to use Rheo's products until he died and even after that got them as long as they were available from his office manager, Frederick Lindblad. When Freddie no longer had access to any Blair products, I began trying to replicate the program with other products. Some could be replaced, some could not. Soybro was the one item I never found much of a replacement for. Others were on again, off again, some company would start making a product I thought was similar to Blair's, then often stop making it, probably due to lack of market interest or high cost.

Charles: Tell us about your dietary regime while on the big program. 

Nathan: First of all, Rheo's program, at least for people like me who were lean and interested in bodybuilding, was high protein, high fat, low carb. For those who needed to lose weight, my understanding is that it was still high protein, low carb, but perhaps not as much fat allowed. Rheo would probably have had bodybuilders like myself practically live off of his protein, mixed with half and half as a protein shake, or made into a pudding with heavy cream, taken maybe 6 times per day along with digestants and other supplements. But, for the moment, the question you asked is about food: Rheo was VERY much against sugar, or anything like sugar. He told me that things like dextrose, maltodextrose, maltodextrins, corn syrup, etc., were really just other forms of sugar and were to be avoided. He even felt that one should avoid honey and fruit juices, which tended to elevate blood sugar. He singled out ketchup, I remember, saying that most brands were over 50% sugar. He felt that salt need never be added to food, that enough sodium would occur naturally.

Charles: I wonder if unrefined sea salt, Celtic Sea Salt, Himalayan Pink Salt etc. were available at that time. These are superb trace mineral sources unlike refined white table salt which is toxic.
Nathan: Foods he specifically thought were good were cottage cheese (if you weren't overweight, you could have peaches or pineapple with it, but only in its natural fruit juice, never in any kind of syrup), beef- steaks, (but not too much meat, as it would throw your phosphorus to calcium ratio out of balance, which was bad for your nervous system). This phosphorus-calcium thing I have never quite understood, but he obviously did. Potatoes were also fine, if you weren't overweight. Carbs in general were to be limited but when you did have carbs they had to be complex carbs, not simple 


carbs. At one time, when I was training heavy with the weights, he had me eating steak and potatoes for breakfast. Eggs were allowed almost any time, from raw to scrambled to soft cooked (not boiled, low temp soft cooked) in the shell. He was very big on eggs, and they were his choice as the food nearest to perfect. Hard cheeses were generally OK, too. He preferred to get everything in natural, unpasteurized, organic form, when possible. Raw milk, cream, and cheese, beef raised with no drugs or hormones, grass fed, etc. About the only thing I know of Rheo allowing that was artificial was the use of saccharin in his ice cream, which was made in an ice cream churn with milk, cream, Blair's Protein, and flavoring. Eggs were used in the French Vanilla version of that ice cream.

 I later learned from Freddie that Rheo was very much against commercially available ice cream. Seems that it not only had loads of sugar, but lots of chemicals too, some of which, through some loophole, the manufacturers were not required to put on the label. Low carb salads were allowed, but not near the time protein supplements were taken, as the salad would interfere with digestion of the protein.

 I don't know if any of Rheo's thoughts would be different now that we know more about glycemic indexes and insulin indexes. As an example, we now know that sweet potatoes have a lower glycemic index level than white potatoes, I do not know if he would therefore be recommending sweet potatoes; we can only speculate on that. One thing I do know is that the human body has not undergone a radical change in just a generation or two, so what Rheo was practicing in the 60s and 70s will still work now, at least for the same percentage of people it worked for then -- and that was most people. 

One critical key to understanding his philosophy was his attempt to achieve a steroid like effect by the extremely high doses of all of the B-Complex he used. He also stressed that the various parts of his program were designed to work synergistically, and therefore would be much less effective if someone tried to pick and choose from the products in his line.  In a broader sense,  Rheo taught me to study and think about nutrition from a scientific standpoint. He emphasized the orthomolecular aspects of nutrition, of working with the cell in mind. I learned to place value on having a diet adequate in complete protein sources. I know the importance of proper digestion and using digestants, and of the critical roles of the  the B and C vitamins. And of course the utility of small, frequent meals, in place of large less frequent ones.  


Charles: What advice did he have for you with regards to exercise?

Nathan: Well, one
 basic piece of advice he gave me -- and which I did  not heed and wish that I
 had -- was to exercise less. Even when I  explained to him that I was 
serious about bodybuilding, and not just  general health, he said I 
should only train 45 minutes or so, 3-4 times a  week. He did not 
recommend training to failure or limit, either, as he  said that 
resulted in "training on nervous energy" - his term. He also  told me 
not to do barbell squats. I understand that this may have had  something
 to do with the endocrine system, but the surface reason he  gave me was
 that "squats will develop squatter's thigh, which does not  look very 
good" It wasn't until years later that I understood what he  was talking
 about, that squats DO build legs, but legs that resemble  tree stumps, 
and have little shape or aesthetic appeal.  As far
 as the amount of training goes, I now know that I was grossly,  
absurdly overtraining, especially in volume, but sometimes in intensity 
 as well.

Charles: As we approach the end of this conversation, Nathan, let's return to the Blair products and what you liked about them.

Nathan: What I liked about Blair products, aside from the fact that they were far more effective, is basically the opposite of what I did not like about Weider. All of the Blair products except for the regular vitamin C, were in capsule form, and easy to swallow. The germ oil product, Soybro, was a soft gel, so no bad taste or texture.  The capsule and soft gel forms were also more likely to be assimilated versus a hard compressed pill which might go through the system without the nutrients being released. The protein powder was easy to mix and stayed pretty well suspended in the shake, less settling. When I started dealing with Blair, he was already selling the milk and egg protein, no longer the soy which he had sold earlier, so that might account for the easier mixing. One other thing about Blair was that if you wanted to use a large number of capsules, of something such as Liver Extract or Soybro, he offered up to 1000 capsule sizes, at a discount when compared with buying many small bottles.

Charles: Would you like to single out and comment on one or more specific products that you found especially effective?

Nathan: Soybro
 was certainly a favorite which I have never been able to replace. A 
company called Enzymatic Therapy made something they called Sterolplex 
for a while, which was similar, but generally, there has been nothing 
like Soybro. It had the heavy lipids removed, thus allowing the uptake of the 
complex sterols in large amounts, without consuming huge amounts of 
difficult to digest fat which occurred in the raw oils. If you took 30 
or more Soybro a day, especially if you were also taking large amounts 
of Liver Extract, you experienced
 a general feeling of well being. Blair's Extra Special Protein has never quite been 
duplicated. It was the most effective, even though I liked the regular 
Blair's protein, taste wise. One product that should be mentioned to 
anyone trying to duplicate Blair's program as seen here, was Softone. 
This was a high grade psyllium husk product. It was inexpensive, but 
actually fairly important to the program, or at least to the program I 
was on, as I got very little fiber when consuming just the dairy 
products and meat. Psyllium and similar products are readily available 
of course. But my favorite Blair products, in order, and with some 
consideration as to how difficult they were to duplicate elsewhere would
 be: Soybro, Protein (regular OR Special), Liver Extract, and Calcium 
P-F.

Charles: Nathan, it's been a real pleasure hearing of your experience with the Rheo H. Blair program. Thank you for sharing this with us.
