WINDSOR, Conn., June 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE:   VOYA), announced today that it has hired Jeff Cimini to lead the company's Retirement Product organization.








Cimini will oversee the team responsible for all aspects of the centralized retirement product functions, including product management, development, strategy, pricing, competitive intelligence, Voya Institutional Trust Company, as well as the advisory services programs that Voya offers to plan sponsors and their participants.  Cimini and the team will expand Voya's efforts to deliver value-focused solutions that drive positive retirement outcomes.
Cimini will be based in Voya's Windsor, Connecticut office.  He will be a member of the Retirement leadership team and report to CEO of Retirement Charlie Nelson, effective July 3.
"As we look to advance outcomes for plan sponsors and participants, we must continue to develop innovative solutions that deliver value and address a broad range of financial wellness needs," said Nelson.  "Jeff has extensive knowledge and experience across many areas of the 401(k) market, including investments, product development, sales and strategy.  He brings an accomplished, client-focused perspective to Voya with a successful track record managing high-performing teams. I look forward to working with Jeff as we continue to help all Americans become financially and emotionally ready to retire."  
Most recently, Cimini was head of strategy for TIAA's Institutional Financial Services division, and also served as head of sales and client services for TIAA's select institutional clients.  Previously, he was head of Personal Retirement for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His background includes more than 20 years with Fidelity Investments, where he held roles of increasing responsibility and leadership across the defined contribution marketplace.  Jeff's experience includes stable value portfolio management, fund analysis, investment consulting and sales, consultant relations, defined contribution investment only (DCIO) sales and investment consulting services.  In addition to retirement, Cimini managed sales and distribution for the Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company division and served as president of its three life insurance entities.
"Voya is on a transformational journey in an industry that serves an important cause and is positioned for significant growth," said Cimini.  "I'm excited to be joining a team that is focused on helping Americans retire better and that demonstrates this commitment with a passion equal to mine."  
Cimini holds a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a Masters in finance from Boston College.

Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

Life insurance products are issued by ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York (Woodbury, NY) and Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (Denver, CO). Variable universal life insurance products are distributed by Voya America Equities, Inc. Within the state of New York, only ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York is admitted and it's products issued. All are members of the Voya® family of companies.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its policies. 





Policy loans and partial withdrawals may vary by state, may generate an income tax liability, reduce available surrender value and reduce the death benefit, or cause the policy to lapse.
1Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.

As a component of benefits offered to employees, 401k plans are a very popular way to accumulate tax-deferred income and earnings for retirement. 
Employers offer 401k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement. You choose how much pre-tax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the 401k plan. Your retirement savings can continue to grow tax-deferred until you make a withdrawal. You do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan. Generally, if you take the distribution after age 59½ there is no tax penalty.  
One difference from an IRA is that 401k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer.     




Key Features

Because your employer sponsors the 401k plan, there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals. Check your plan carefully. The following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you:

Optional Participation: Although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations, 401k plan participation is still optional. Check with your employer to determine how you can enroll. 
Contribution Rate: You can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established IRS limits. You will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan.
Your 401k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period. (That’s a good thing!) 
Available Investments: You can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer.
Deferred Taxes: Not only do your pre-tax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period, but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred. Note: Some plans offer a Roth 401k, which permit savings on an after tax basis.  
You will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal. 
Optional Employer Match: To provide an extra boost to retirement savings, many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested. 
Accessing Funds During Employment: Loans—As an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified IRS limits. Hardship Withdrawals—Understanding that certain hardships arise, the IRS permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons. 
Portability: If you leave your job, you can remain in the plan or rollover your 401k funds into an IRA or another 401k.
Support: Your 401k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals, measure your progress, and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals.
The 457 and 403b plans are similar to 401k plans, but are typically offered by other types of organizations. The 457 plan is offered to employees of state and local governments. The 403b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified tax-exempt organizations such as higher-education, churches, tax-exempt hospitals, and charities.
Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans. Roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income, but qualified distributions may be taken tax-free in retirement.1  



Suitable For




The 401k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement.  








Eligibility
 



You must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a 401k plan to participate. 
If you leave employment, you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan. 
Some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave. 
You can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover IRA or in most cases, into the 401k plan offered by your new employer.
Contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain IRS-defined annual limits. Contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay. The contributions are taken before taxes, lowering your current income tax bill. You will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ are also subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies.

This material is provided for general and educational purposes only; it is not intended to provide legal, tax or investment advice. All investments are subject to risk. We recommend that you consult an independent legal or financial advisor for specific advice about your individual situation.

1A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income. A qualified distribution is one that occurs at least five years after the year of the participant’s first designated Roth contribution (counting such first year as part of the five) and is made: - On or after the participant’s attainment of age 59½, - On account of the participant’s disability, or - On or after the participant’s death. 
If the distribution is not a qualified distribution, then the accumulated Roth 401k earnings will be subject to tax, and additional taxes may apply. Roth 401k amounts are subject to the same required minimum distribution rules as other contributions made to the 401k plan.

Voya Financial Announces Fixed Index Annuity Product

In an expansion of its portfolio of fixed index annuity products, Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA) has just announced the new Voya Journey Index Annuity. According to a recent InsuranceNewsNet article, the new product provides investors with a simple “two stage interest-crediting approach that offers full growth potential, while providing protection from market declines.” Individuals also have the flexibility to use multiple crediting strategies with the addition of dynamic indices from J.P. Morgan (J.P. Morgan MeridianSM Index)  and Citigroup (Citi Dynamic Asset Selector 5 Excess Return Index). 
“Americans are looking for new ways to grow and protect their retirement savings in today’s uncertain world,” stated Voya’s CEO of Annuities and Individual Life, Carolyn Johnson. “The Voya Journey Index Annuity gives individuals the ability to plan with confidence. They can enjoy the benefits of increasing their future retirement income and rest easy knowing that their hard-earned savings are protected from unpredictable market swings.”  
The new annuity product is a single-premium deferred fixed index annuity that offers full participation in the growth of one or more dynamic indices over a seven-year time period. Individuals can pick between the J.P. Morgan and Citigroup indices, which both seek to adjust to market conditions to provide steady growth potential. But one of the most distinguishing features of the Voya Journey Index Annuity is the simple “two stage” approach to growing retirement funds. In the first stage, the account value can potentially earn an annual “performance” credit when the selected index remains above the initial level during the first six years. In the second stage, the policyholder has the potential to earn more interest credit. At the end of the seventh year, 100% of the selected index gains over the seven-year period are credited to the original premium. 
“In today’s low interest rate environment, the Voya Journey Index Annuity is a good alternative to taxable bank certificates or the volatility of bond mutual funds,” Johnson added. “Individuals have the opportunity to potentially earn better returns and still have protection from market volatility.” 
The market for fixed index annuities is growing, making the Voya Journey Index Annuity even more attractive. According to LIMRA sales data, fixed index annuity sales increased 22% in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same time frame the previous year. Industry experts believe that this demonstrates an interest by consumers in the benefits of such products to help provide a dependable stream of income in retirement. 
The new fixed index annuity is issued by the Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, a member of the Voya Financial family of companies.
