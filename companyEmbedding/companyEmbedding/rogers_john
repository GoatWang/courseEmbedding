Description



Product Description
Rogers Group WOUNDED TO THE REAR OR ONE MORE SHOT. Alva Museum Replica, 1961 (original of 1864). Plaster statuette; Height, 23.5 inches; length of base, 9.5 inches; depth from front of base, 10 inches; salmon coloration.
Rogers could neither sketch nor paint, but was a master model maker who could make anything that could be conceptualized in three dimensions. He produced twelve war groups, with this being one of his most popular: there are photographs of both Rogers himself and George Armstrong Custer each next to this particular sculpture. A neighbor of Rogers posed for the standing soldier, wearing the uniform in which he had fought during the war. It was originally commissioned for a monument that was never produced. The Alva company is now out of business and this sculpture is hardly found today, having been out of production for many years.
Excellent; clean with no chipping.
Rogers Groups were originally modeled in clay by Rogers himself; then cast in bronze.  From the bronze, molds were made for the groups in plaster.  Then painted, usually tan putty color but sometimes darker brown or lighter gray.  Rogers’ marketing material encourages buyers to paint the groups to accommodate the buyer’s own taste and decorating style, so they are often seen in a variety of colors.
In a manner of speaking, he was the Norman Rockwell “Saturday Evening Post Cover” – but in clay sculpture:  thousands of the 80 different published groupings (12 Civil War themed) sold!John Rogers (1829-1904) created groups from 1859 to 1892 on the subjects of everyday life, the theatre, Shakespeare, the Civil War and horses. At a time when it was in vogue to have parlor statuary in one’s home, Rogers provided appealing high quality durable plaster statuary which was well within the financial reach of many for whom marble or bronze statuary was not. “Rogers’ Groups” were a staple in many households in the 19th century. He was mostly self-taught, his whose work was most popular from 1860 to 1880. A middle class home of the Victorian period would not have been complete without a Rogers Group, framed by lace curtains, sitting in the front window.

Rogers Fresh – Wholesale Produce & Seafood













































 


 















Rogers Fresh




















Welcome to
Rogers Wholesale Produce & Seafood

Serving the tri-state region for over 75 years! 



 
















 
























 

   The Beginning John E. Rogers, Inc. was founded in 1935 by first generation owner John Rogers, who began selling local produce out of the fertile valley in Great Meadows, NJ. He famously tells the story of driving his Ford Model T to the Washington Street Market in NYC to deliver a load of produce and not passing a single car on his 70-mile trip back. How times have changed! 

 

  Today Now, 75 years later, our company is still family owned and operated. Headed by John’s son Thomas and his son David, the company has adapted to changing times. We work with a variety of businesses – from large chain stores to restaurants and family farm markets – and we take pride in selling farm fresh produce to our customers. Over the span of our existence we’ve expanded our goods to include seafood of all types, including shellfish, frozen fish and fresh fish to order.  

 


The strength of our business is built upon the relationships we maintain, both with our employees and our customers. We take pride in honest business, friendly service and quality products.



 

 

 


Our fruit selection, along with all of our other products, varies based on what’s delicious and in season.  Imagine a winter filled with lusciously sweet seedless Naval Oranges and juicy Tangelos leading you to a spring blossoming abundantly with local flair.  In the early spring we thoroughly enjoy the (unfortunately) short NJ strawberry season and rhubarb kicking off our need for sweets and tarts in the warm ease of spring.  Our local fruit blossoms into peaches, watermelons, nectarines all the while we follow the California and Washington seasons through their delicious cherry, plum, grape and other delectable fruits.  Give us a call to see what’s ringing our tastebuds this season!


 

 

 


When it comes to vegetables we are in a league of our own.  When John Rogers started our company in the late 1930’s with a model T and strong local farming community, his vision led us down the path we continue to follow today.  Our community of local farmers continues to grow and we lean on local for as much wonderful fresh produce as is in season.  As with every good thing, when the local season ends in the late fall months we move our supply to include fresh produce from sea to shining sea!  Once you’ve tried our various local lettuce in the summer you’ll never open a bag to make a salad again!  Start your spring in the right direction with some world famous NJ asparagus then enjoy all those wonderful Eggplant, tomatoes, broccoli, carrots and everything that brings us into the brussels sprouts that are the tail end of the local crop.  Of course when our local farmers hang their hats for the season we count on the bountiful west coast and southeast to fill the gap throughout the winter.


 

 

 


Imagine fish from the coast of NJ, NY and New England fresh and in season – sound delicious??  It is!  We take pride in sourcing the freshest clams, oysters and fresh fish all year long and keeping our customers fed with the best there is to offer.  We’ve always taken pride in offering options for customers to enjoy FRESH.  Of course for those interested in enormous Alaskan King Crab Legs, Canadian Lobster Tails and Shrimp from the biggest to the smallest; we try to have a little something for everyone.  Give us a call today to order some fish fresher than you’ll get anywhere else.

Skin-Like Microfluidic Systems for Capture, Storage and Chemical Analysis of SweatSoft, flexible and stretchable microfluidic systems, including embodiments that integrate wireless communication electronics, can intimately and robustly bond to the surface of skin without chemical or mechanical irritation. This integration defines an access point for a small set of sweat glands such that perspiration spontaneously initiates routing of sweat through a microfluidic network and set of reservoirs. Embedded chemical reagents respond in colorimetric fashion to markers such as chloride and hydronium ions, glucose and lactate. Wireless interfaces to digital image capture hardware on a smartphone serve as a means for quantitation.



Thin, Battery-free, Skin-like Devices for Blood OximetryWireless power transfer and data communication strategies provide the foundations for 'epidermal' light emitting devices that are capable of clinical-quality measurements of optical properties of the skin, with ability to capture photoplesmyograms for determination blood oximetry, heart rate, heart rate variability and other characteristics related to cardiovascular health.  The initmate skin interface enables levels of measurement fidelity and user comfort that cannot be achieved with traditional, wrist-mounted wearables.



Microscale Kirigami via Mechanical Buckling -- Electronic Pop-up BooksColorized scanning electron micrographs of 3D structures formed by a mechanically directed self-assembly process, in which thin materials patterned in 2D by semiconductor manufacturing techniques spontaneously rise up out of the plane to yield 3D architectures with engineering control.  The resulting capabilities far exceed anything that is possible with traditional 3D printing techniques..



3D Microarchitectures in Device-Grade SiliconColorized scanning electron micrograph of a complex, three-dimensional structure formed by transformation of a planar, two-dimensional precursor. Controlled buckling follows from compressive forces that act at precise locations across the structure upon release of prestrain in an elastomeric substrate. This example uses microscale ribbons and plates of silicon, with potential applications in electronic circuits, battery anodes, photodetectors, and other semiconductor devices.



A Digital Camera With a Design Inspired by the Insect EyeIn arthropods, evolution has created a remarkably sophisticated class of imaging system, with wide angle field of view, low aberrations, high acuity to motion and infinite depth of field.  We demonstrated materials and fabrication schemes for arthropod-inspired cameras with numbers of imaging elements comparable to those found in the eyes fire ants and bark beetles  The devices combine elastomeric compound optics with deformable arrays of thin silicon photodetectors, in co-integrated sheets that can be blown up like a balloon.



Soft, Microfluidic Assemblies of Circuits, Sensors and Radios for the SkinChip-scale components contained in thin, elastomeric microfluidic structures and interconnected with 'origami' type wiring networks yield stretchable wireless systems that can gently but robustly integrate with the surface of the skin for multifunctional physiological status monitoring.  The ability to use off-the-shelf integrated circuits, sensors and radios in skin-compatible, soft designs opens up many near-term opportunities in healthcare and non-healthcare related applications alike. (Image credit: F. Frankel)



A Physically Transient Form of ElectronicsSilk, magnesium, magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide and silicon nanomembranes provide a collection of materials for high performance integrated circuits, actuators, sensors and power supply systems that dissolve, completely and with controlled rates, in water or biofluids.  Potential applications of this transient electronics technology range from resorbable medical implants, to degradable environmental monitors, to compostable consumer devices.  The image illustrates a transient electronic circuit in a state of partial dissolution in a puddle of water



3D Electronic PericardiumUltrathin, 3D elastic membranes shaped precisely to match the epicardium serve as platforms for deformable arrays of multifunctional sensors, electronic and optoelectronic components. Such integumentary devices completely envelop the heart, in a form-fitting manner, to provide a mechanically stable biotic-/abiotic interface during normal cardiac cycles.  These systems form an 'artificial pericardium' with advanced functional capabilities in sensing and stimulation, of relevance for both basic studies and clinical use.



Epidermal PhotonicsSystems that combine pixelated arrays of thermochromic liquid crystals and wireless electronics on thin, soft elastomers yield physical properties - modulus, elastic strain limit, thickness and thermal mass - that are matched to the epidermis, for precise thermal characterization of the skin.  The results can be used to determine cardiovascular health, progressions in wound healing cascades and other parameters of relevance to human health.



Flexible, Adaptive Camouflage System With a Design Based on the Cephalopod SkinThis multilayered, multifunctional system adopts a bio-inspired design, derived from study of the skins of cephalopods, i.e. squid, octopus, cuttlefish.  Here, a color-changing collection of pixels (analogous to the chromatophores and leucophores in a cephalopod) in the top layer automatically configures itself to match any pattern of illumination from the surrounding environment.  A distributed array of ultrathin silicon photodetectors (analogous to opsins) provides information that controls a corresponding set of actuators (analogous to muscle fibers).



Phase Separated Nanostructures in Printed Lines of Block CopolymersSuperfine resolution jet printing techniques and processes of self-assembly in block copolymers can be exploited together to form well-defined nanostructures in wide-ranging, hierarchical geometries with length scales from centimeters to nanometers.  Multiple polymers with different molecular weights or mixtures of molecular weights can be printed onto a single substrate, to provide access to patterns with diverse layouts and feature sizes for applications in advanced nanolithography.



Greek Cross Fractal Design for a Stretchable Electrophysiological Sensor and Temperature DetectorThin films of hard electronic materials patterned into filamentary, fractal structures and embedded in soft elastomers provide routes to compliant, skin-like devices for physiological monitoring and interventional medicine.



Nanoscale Thermocapillary Flow As a Route to Arrays of Semiconducting Carbon NanotubesElectrical current selectively injected into metallic nanotubes in aligned arrays leads to thermocapillary flows in amorphous organic thin film coatings.  The trenches that result from this process leave these tubes exposed, to allow their selective removal.  The semiconducting tubes that are left behind can be integrated into high performance electronics and digital integrated circuits.



Mechanical Energy Harvester on the Surface of the HeartWearable electronics, biomedical implants, environmental monitors and many other types of devices could benefit from approaches to power supply that do not require batteries.  Means for harvesting power directly from the ambient environment or from natural processes of the body represent attractive possibilities.  This image shows a thin, flexible device that can harvest and store energy from the mechanical motions of the heart, lung and/or diaphragm, at levels that meet requirements for pacemakers and other existing implantable devices.



Stretchable Lithium Ion BatteryThin, elastomeric substrates, distributed arrays of active materials, and 'spring-within-a-spring' interconnect structures yield a kind of rechargeable lithium ion battery that has the mechanics of a rubber band.  Such devices could be useful for powering electronic circuits that laminate onto the skin or other surfaces of the human body.



Spatio-temporal mapping of brain activity during epileptic seizuresFlexible, bio-integrated sheets of sensors and electronics provide new tools for mapping electrical activity in the brain, with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.  The resulting technology is providing new insights into the neuroscience of epilepsy, in a form that also has clinical relevance for surgical procedures used to treat the most acute cases of epilepsy.  The image shown here is a color representation of electrical potential measured across the surface of the brain of a feline animal model, recorded during an induced seizure.



A Cellular-Scale, Injectable Optoelectronics TechnologyIn neuroscience, an ability to insert light sources, detectors, sensors and other components into precise locations of the deep brain could yield versatile and important capabilities. We recently reported an ultrathin, 'injectable' class of cellular-scale optoelectronics that offers such features, with examples of completely wireless and programmed complex behavioral control over freely moving animals. The ability of these ultrathin, mechanically compliant, biocompatible devices also can be used in other organ systems.  The image shows a representative device, threaded through the eye of a needle.



Large Area Negative Index MetamaterialsHigh resolution printing techniques enable the formation of large-area sheets of materials that display negative index of refraction, for advanced imaging devices, photonic components and sensors.



Epidermal ElectronicsSpecially designed materials, geometrical forms and integration layouts enable electronic systems with physical properties matched to the epidermis, suitable as a new class of skin-integrated device for applications in physiological status monitoring, wound measurement/treatment, human/machine interfaces, covert communications and others.



Stretchable Silicon Integrated CircuitThese devices use silicon nanomaterials in ultrathin layouts that place the active materials in the neutral mechanical plane, i.e. the plane where bending induced strains are zero.  Bonding this type of circuit to a prestretched rubber substrate leads to 'wavy' shapes that behave mechanically much like an accordion bellows when stretched or compressed.  The result is a stretchable, high performance circuit technology.



Electronic eyeball cameraThis advanced camera uses a hemispherically curved array of photodetectors, in a design inspired by the human retina.  This layout enables wide angle fields of view, with uniform illumination and very low aberrations, even when very simple imaging optics are used.



Bio-integrated electronics for cardiac therapyThis flexible, waterproof circuit can wrap the surface of the heart, to produce high resolution 'maps' of electrical behavior of the cardiac muscle, during beating.  The data can help surgeons locate aberrant tissues that are responsible for certain types of arrhythmias.



Flexible Silicon Microcell PhotovoltaicsThis unusual PV device consists of an interconnected collection of microbars of silicon, created by controlled etching and release from a silicon wafer followed by transfer printing onto a thin sheet of plastic.  The device offers the performance of conventional, rigid silicon modules, but with the lightweight, mechanically flexible construction found in organic photovoltaics.



Electronics on Balloons: Instrumented Surgical CathetersThis advanced cardiac surgical and diagnostic device involves high performance semiconductor components (e.g. microscale LEDs), RF ablation electrodes and multi-modal sensors, all integrated into the inflatable surface of an otherwise convetnional balloon catheter.  Advanced materials, device designs and concepts in mechanics enable these systems to function at levels of inflation that corresponds of strains of nearly 200%.  The device delivers high resolution EP mapping, sensing and ablation functionality to the endocardial surface, in a minimally invasive mode for treating arrythmias.

 Rogers Research Group
We seek to understand and exploit interesting characteristics of 'soft' materials, such as polymers, liquid crystals, and biological tissues as well as hybrid combinations of them with unusual classes of micro/nanomaterials, in the form of ribbons, wires, membranes, tubes or related. Our aim is to control and induce novel electronic and photonic responses in these materials; we also develop new 'soft lithographic' and biomimetic approaches for patterning them and guiding their growth. This work combines fundamental studies with forward-looking engineering efforts in a way that promotes positive feedback between the two. Our current research focuses on soft materials for conformal electronics, nanophotonic structures, microfluidic devices, and microelectromechanical systems, all lately with an emphasis on bio-inspired and bio-integrated technologies. These efforts are highly multidisciplinary, and combine expertise from nearly every traditional field of technical study.
