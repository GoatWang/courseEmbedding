Jeffrey A. Rivest, FACHE

BALTIMORE – Jeffrey A. Rivest, who has served as  president and chief executive officer of the University of Maryland Medical  Center (UMMC) since 2004, will be retiring at the end of August 2015. UMMC is the flagship academic medical center  of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). 
“On  behalf of the UMMS and UMMC family, I want to thank Jeff for his outstanding  contributions over the last 11 years,” said Robert A. Chrencik, president and  CEO of UMMS. “Under Jeff’s leadership, the Medical Center has continued to see  its profile rise as one of our nation’s best academic medical centers. I am very proud of the teamwork and  dedication that, under Jeff’s guidance, has fostered UMMC’s delivery of world-class  time sensitive critical care medicine. ”
John  Ashworth, currently the UMMS senior vice president for network development,  will serve as the interim UMMC president and chief executive officer beginning Saturday,  August 29th. Ashworth has previously  served as UMMC president and chief executive officer, as well as director of  the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. A  search committee for a permanent president and CEO will be formed with  representation of both the UMMS and UMMC boards, as well as partners from the  University of Maryland School of Medicine. Rivest will remain an advisor during the interim period. 
 
“Jeff's leadership has been integral to the growth and success of the Medical Center for over a decade,” said Louise Michaux Gonzales, Esq., chair of the UMMC Board of Directors. “I am particularly grateful this last year for his guiding hand in the establishment of the new Board of Directors. We will miss him.”  
“After  11 years as CEO and 40 years in health care leadership, now is the right time  for me to pursue many personal interests I have deferred for far too long,”  said Rivest.  “I am excited about what  the future holds for UMMC and its talented and caring staff at all levels. UMMC and
UMMS  are very well-positioned to deal with the many challenges facing the health  care field today. The future is very  bright.”

Rivest will remain an advisor during the interim period. 
 
“Jeff's leadership has been integral to the growth and success of the Medical Center for over a decade,” said Louise Michaux Gonzales, Esq., chair of the UMMC Board of Directors. “I am particularly grateful this last year for his guiding hand in the establishment of the new Board of Directors. We will miss him.”  
“After  11 years as CEO and 40 years in health care leadership, now is the right time  for me to pursue many personal interests I have deferred for far too long,”  said Rivest.  “I am excited about what  the future holds for UMMC and its talented and caring staff at all levels. UMMC and
UMMS  are very well-positioned to deal with the many challenges facing the health  care field today. The future is very  bright.”
