Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. John P Maroon DDS2168 Balboa AveSan Diego, CA 92109(858) 273-2800DentistsCosmetic DentistryWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. John David Neuenswander, DDS6616 Mission Gorge RdSan Diego, CA 92120(619) 280-7866DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Johnston, John W, DDS1324 Garnet AveSan Diego, CA 92109(858) 273-3400DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. John Lofthus DDS8899 University Center Ln Ste 100San Diego, CA 92122(858) 459-4364DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. John Grim DDS9932 Mercy RdSan Diego, CA 92129(858) 566-2151DentistsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Mobilia, John A, DDS12405 Rancho Bernardo RdSan Diego, CA 92128(858) 385-1838DentistsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Dimaccio, John P, Dds - Family Dentistry903 Highland AveNational City, CA 91950(619) 474-2256DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. John J O'neil DDS345 F St Ste 290Chula Vista, CA 91910(619) 420-4523DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. John K Yamamoto Jr DDS251 F StChula Vista, CA 91910(619) 426-4604DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Hoss John E DDS Orthodontics(5)7855 Fay Ave Ste 220La Jolla, CA 92037(858) 454-7111DentistsOrthodontistsWebsiteServicesThis is the Best Dentist I have ever been to the whole thing went by so fast did not even give me the time to be afraid.Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. John J Taddey, DDS7946 Ivanhoe Ave Ste 107La Jolla, CA 92037(858) 454-9333DentistsDental HygienistsDental ClinicsWebsiteServicesFrom Business: John J.
