Alaminos, officially the City of Alaminos (Pangasinan: Siyudad na Alaminos; Ilocano: Ciudad ti Alaminos; Filipino: Lungsod ng Alaminos), is a fourth class city[6] in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. It was named after Juan Alaminos y de Vivar, former Governor-General of the Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 89,708 people.[3] It is bounded by the municipalities of Sual, Bani, and Mabini.
Hundred Islands National Park, a tourism destination composed of +123 small islands, is located off the coast of Barangay Lucap, Alaminos City.
The Communist Party of the Philippines was founded by Jose Maria Sison in the remote barangay of Dulacac on December 26, 1968.[7]
Alaminos was badly hit in May 2009 by Typhoon Emong which damaged a lot of houses in the city, including the roof of the main church. Due to this, several organizations had requested donations and aid to help in restoring the town back to its former self.
The Alaminos Airport is currently being built near the city to service the local area.[8]

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

Alaminos, officially the City of Alaminos (Pangasinan: Siyudad na Alaminos; Ilocano: Ciudad ti Alaminos; Filipino: Lungsod ng Alaminos), is a fourth class city[6] in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. It was named after Juan Alaminos y de Vivar, former Governor-General of the Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 89,708 people.[3] It is bounded by the municipalities of Sual, Bani, and Mabini.
Hundred Islands National Park, a tourism destination composed of +123 small islands, is located off the coast of Barangay Lucap, Alaminos City.
The Communist Party of the Philippines was founded by Jose Maria Sison in the remote barangay of Dulacac on December 26, 1968.[7]
Alaminos was badly hit in May 2009 by Typhoon Emong which damaged a lot of houses in the city, including the roof of the main church. Due to this, several organizations had requested donations and aid to help in restoring the town back to its former self.
The Alaminos Airport is currently being built near the city to service the local area.[8]

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

Alaminos was badly hit in May 2009 by Typhoon Emong which damaged a lot of houses in the city, including the roof of the main church. Due to this, several organizations had requested donations and aid to help in restoring the town back to its former self.
The Alaminos Airport is currently being built near the city to service the local area.[8]

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

History[edit]
Folk etymology attributes the name "Bolinao" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece "monamon" but commonly called "Bolinao" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time "pamulinawen" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.
Unofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odorico who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.[7]
According to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.[7]
The Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.
This town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.
First Mass[edit]
On November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the historical fact that the first Mass was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.[8]
Hard coal spill[edit]
Bolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon "Mina" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.[9]
Bolinao Skull[edit]
The Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.[10]
World War II[edit]
The Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.

Language[edit]
Main article: Bolinao language
The word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.
The Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.
The Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.

Cape Bolinao Lighthouse[edit]




Cape Bolinao Lighthouse


The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises 351 feet (107 m) above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a 351 feet (107 m) high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.
The lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectare Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.
According to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is 250 feet (76 m). Visibility is 20 miles (32 km; 17 nmi) at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an over-all total of 134 steps.

Celeste Fierro


ONE Group’s Growth


An Interview with Celeste Fierro, Senior Vice President, The ONE Group


Editors’ Note
In 1997, Celeste Fierro founded Cititaste Events and quickly became one of the most sought-after event planners in New York City. In 2004, her career catapulted to the next level when she and Jonathan Segal opened ONE, a restaurant in the heart of New York City’s Meatpacking District. The success of ONE led to the creation of STK and several additional equally as successful concepts that now span the globe. 
Company Brief
The ONE Group (www.togrp.com) is a global hospitality company that develops and operates luxury restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, and a turnkey food and beverage operation for boutique hotel groups. Founded in 2004, the company currently operates a number of brands including STK, Asellina, Cucina Asellina, Heraea, and Heliot, and partners in nightclub Tenjune and French bistro, Bagatelle. The company operates venues in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Atlanta. In 2012, The ONE Group expanded internationally with The Hippodrome Casino and STK in the ME Hotel, both in London.
What excited you about founding The ONE Group? Has it been what you expected?
It has been better. When I met Jonathan (Segal, Founder and CEO), I was running an event company. A mutual friend introduced us and we became friends. He thought the restaurant business was more about the DJs and less focused on the food, and he wanted to focus on all of it: the food, service, design, and music.
I thought it would be great to come in and undertake that with him, utilizing my marketing and events background. We hit it off. I never thought we’d have as many venues as we have now, so it has been pretty incredible.

Is it tough to communicate that The ONE Group has a great food program when you’re known more for the music and design aesthetic?
People love the food. Even if they are initially enticed to come in for the party, they always leave very impressed with our cuisine. We stand apart because we have both the party atmosphere and high quality items on our menu. All of our chefs are top of the line. 
Do you tailor the STK experience to the specific location or is there a similar feel in each one?
We tailor the dishes, a bit of the music, and the decor to the attitude of each city.
In Los Angeles, the food is extra fresh because people pay more attention to their health there; in Miami, the food has a Latin theme; Atlanta is a Southern market so we have a southern flair. In New York, the music is louder at our downtown location than it is in our midtown location. 
Is it challenging to manage the growth when you’re moving at such speed? What are you planning for Las Vegas?
It’s a challenge, but the more you open, the easier it gets because you have an experienced team that comes in to manage the opening. In Las Vegas, we’ve opened a new concept we created called Heraea: it’s a sports-themed restaurant and lounge. It has similarities to STK, but it is a sports and vibe driven venue. The food is upscale, not just wings and nachos.
You have also expanded in London. Are there more opportunities internationally?
We handle the food and beverage program for The Hippodrome Casino in London – that was the first property we did. Then we opened Heliot, which is a steakhouse inside the Hippodrome. We just opened STK in the ME Hotel, as well as Asellina, which is our Italian restaurant. We are also handling the food and beverage for the ME Hotel, which is right at the end of the Strand in London.
We’re also looking to do STK in Berlin.
In an industry with high turnover, how have you retained your people?
Our biggest strength is the fact that our staff is so loyal and a lot of them have worked their way up in the company. We promote from within and that creates a loyal employee following because you’re giving them an opportunity to start and build a career. We try to be as corporate as necessary, but we also treat you as family.
We do a lot of things together as a company. I know everyone’s name, Jonathan shakes everyone’s hand every night he walks into the restaurants; we are hands-on and very visible.
I’m running seven cities and I’m in the restaurants all the time; my staff knows who I am and I encourage input from them.

How important is it to continue to innovate in this business?
It’s all about marketing and staying in touch with customers, which builds loyalty. We have customers at STK who have continued to come regularly since the day we opened. We know their names; we’ll always seat our regulars and we make them feel special. People want a consistently good product but also to know they’re going to be taken good care of.
I practice that in my management. We also get involved in different charity and promotional events in the cities where we’re based. We like to get the word out about our restaurants.
At senior levels, this is a male-oriented business. Is that changing?
Women are generally more detail-oriented and can multi-task, which works well in this industry. You have to love what you do and be competent at it, and all of the women that work for me have those qualities. You learn from your leaders and Jonathan has empowered me to be a woman in this business. I used to be intimidated but now I’m not. I know the business and we have a good product.
We attract women because they want to work for a company that is empowering but also consistent and that gives them the opportunity for longevity and growth.
Do you take time to reflect on the success or is it always on to the next?
Because we’re opening so quickly, it’s tough, but you do step back and appreciate it. It’s about being out there continuously, maintaining relationships, and giving the customer a great experience. I believe that makes the difference.•

Celeste Fierro

Native New Yorker Celeste Fierro has worked in the hospitality industry for more than ten years. In 2004, she opened ONE Little West 12—now the new home of Bagatelle—with her business partner in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District. The success of ONE led to the creation and opening of her second Meatpacking restaurant, STK, a steakhouse geared toward women, which was up until this point a concept void in the hospitality scene. As the restaurants began to multiply beyond the two in Meatpacking, new concepts developed and Fierro’s empire grew to include locations in L.A., Miami, Las Vegas, and Turks and Caicos within a few short years. Today, Fierro holds the title of senior vice president for The ONE Group, the corporate entity of all of her venues. Here, she shares a day in her busy schedule as she launches new restaurants in L.A., London, and New York.

6:00 AMLand at JFK on the red-eye from LAX. My company, The ONE Group, has two restaurants, STK and Bagatelle, in West Hollywood, so I spend about one-third of my time there. I recently purchased a home in LA, so I guess one could say I’m bi-coastal, although I don’t love that term because I am 100 percent a New Yorker. I do, however, enjoy my time out there. When I am not working, I go on a lot of hikes and have dinner parties at the house.

7:30 AMGo for a jog on the West Side Highway. Listen to Rihanna and Coldplay on my iPod.

9:00 AMWalk over to the Gansevoort Park Hotel, where my company operates the food and beverage program. I get my daily green juice drink, which my colleagues refers to it as the ‘slime.’ It has kale, spinach, wheatgrass, apple, and pineapple. I plan on living to 100.

10:00 AMWalk to my office in the Meatpacking District while on a conference call on my Blackberry. I often walk and talk into my headphones, so people on the street probably think I am a crazy lady.

11:00 AMMeet with my assistant to make sure that all my meetings have been confirmed for the day. Make phone calls and answer emails on my Blackberry while pacing around my office. Sitting still at a desk was never my thing.

1:00 PM Business lunch at STK Midtown where I nosh on my favorite lunch item, the lobster Cobb salad. The meeting is usually either a new business opportunity, or an event partnership where we go over logistics. 

3:00 PMMeet with my dear friend, Nicole Jones, wife of Andruw Jones of the New York Yankees. Nicole and Andruw are the ambassadors of Jaden’s Ladder, a non-profit organization that assists survivors of domestic violence with life-enhancing, post shelter programs. Every year my company donates vacation packages to be auctioned at the charity’s annual fundraiser.

5:00 PMHead to Bagatelle for a chef tasting. I try not to eat too much of each dish, but I love French cuisine, so it’s a challenge. It’s amazing how my palate has become so discerning over the years.

7:30 PMMeet friends at Asellina for dinner and drinks. My favorites on the menu include the Buffalo Mozzarella appetizer and the homemade pasta dish, pistachio garganelli. While it may appear that I am socializing, I am still at one of my venues, so I am paying close attention to the flow of service and introducing myself to new faces.

11:30 PMI make my way back to my loft apartment overlooking Madison Square Park. I usually end my night by lighting candles and unwind with a glass of red wine after pushing send on the night’s last email.
