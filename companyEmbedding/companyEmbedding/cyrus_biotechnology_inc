Bench® software increases access to cutting edge technology which can 
      speed design and development of new therapies, consumer products


SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cyrus Biotechnology, Inc., a Seattle-based biotechnology software firm 
      offering an advanced computational tool for protein modeling and design 
      to accelerate new drug discovery, today announced the closing of an $8M 
      total Series A financing. The investment was led by Trinity Ventures, 
      with participation from OrbiMed Advisors, SpringRock Ventures, W Fund 
      and individual investors.
    

      Cyrus Bench® software is based on years of work in computational 
      biophysics and the first software algorithms to design new proteins in a 
      computer. It accelerates drug discovery at pharmaceutical and 
      biotechnology firms, as well as new product development at synthetic 
      biology, chemical and consumer products firms. Bench® is a graphical, 
      cloud-enabled version of the Rosetta protein modeling toolkit. Data 
      generated from Rosetta technology can be used in the design of new 
      potential therapeutics, such as a therapeutic protein of Tocagen’s Toca 
      511 and PVP Biologics’ KumaMax, an oral enzyme.
    

      “We are very excited to close this first institutional financing round 
      with such knowledgeable, high-caliber biotech and high-tech investors,” 
      said Cyrus CEO Dr. Lucas Nivon. “The new funding validates our business 
      plan and allows us to expand the capabilities and opportunities of this 
      cutting-edge platform. Our Bench® technology broadens access to the most 
      advanced computational methods, giving more scientists the means to 
      speed their research and save costs. The result will be more effective 
      drugs getting to patients sooner.”
    

      Cyrus offers Bench®, a Software-as-a-Service platform for protein 
      structure prediction, discovery, modeling, stabilization, engineering 
      and design, along with custom software development and experienced 
      scientific support services in computational protein engineering. Bench® 
      has been designed to make this technology more user-friendly and for a 
      wider range of users than previous academic-based software. Cyrus 
      launched a software beta in 2016 with initial release in early 2017, and 
      has rapidly acquired customers ranging from Fortune 500 Pharma 
      (including seven of the top 20 pharma firms), chemical and consumer 
      products firms to privately-held biotech and synthetic biology firms.
    

      “We are very excited to bring Cyrus Bench to a wide variety of 
      customers, from blue chip Pharma firms to tiny startups, to truly 
      democratize computational protein engineering and lower the cost of 
      entry, as we have seen happen in software tech,” said Gus Tai, General 
      Partner at Trinity Ventures who will join the Board of Directors, along 
      with Eric Bell at SpringRock.
    

      Carl Gordon of OrbiMed Advisors added, “I think Cyrus software will 
      accelerate early therapeutics discovery in many organizations, 
      especially at biologics focused biotech firms that are not currently 
      benefitting from new biotech algorithms and software.”

ABOUT CYRUS BENCH







Cyrus Bench ™ Cyrus Bench is an easy-to-use version of the Rosetta molecular modeling and protein design software package. Rosetta is the leading protein structure prediction tool, with top performance in the CASP and CAMEO competitions. Rosetta is the first software experimentally proven to design new proteins computationally, including the first designed protein binder with antibody-like affinity.

Delivery Cyrus Bench delivers Rosetta with the complete associated array of bio-molecular computation tools (e.g. BLAST) required to use Rosetta to its full potential. This scientific backbone is delivered via a custom-designed new Rosetta interface GUI that works in a modern web browser, paired with automation of a growing set of standard user procedures, and deployed on the best cloud compute resources.


FEATURED PUBLICATIONS
 



MODELING
Rosetta is the leading protein modeling tool, with proven performance in protein structure prediction, protein-ligand docking, protein-protein docking, antibody modeling, and structure modeling with experimental information (X-ray, NMR, Cryo-EM). Rosetta algorithms are tested and refined on real experimental data, and have consistently delivered actionable and verifiable wet-lab results.




Protein Structure Prediction Rosetta consistently outperforms the competition in protein homology modeling at the bi-annual CASP competition and the weekly CAMEO contest (Song, Structure, 2013). Rosetta was the first software package to consistently predict small protein structures “ab initio”, with no homology (Kim, Proteins, 2014).

Protein Interactions Rosetta is a pioneer in flexible-backbone protein-ligand docking (Davis, JMB, 2009). Rosetta is a leader in antibody homology modeling, and protein-protein docking with homologs.

Experimental Data Rosetta can be combined with experimental structural data to produce better structures, or new atomic-resolution structures that are otherwise impossible. Low-quality x-ray data can be used to produce high-resolution structures  (Adams, Ann. Rev. Biophys. 2013), or sparse NMR data can be transformed into useful structures (Lange, PNAS, 2012).




DESIGN

Rosetta is the world leader in computer design of proteins, and has achieved a number of “firsts”, including the first full-computationally designed and experimentally verified protein and the first protein-binding protein designed in a computer.
   
Protein-ligand Interaction Design Rosetta has proven the ability to re-design natural enzymes to act on novel substrates, even in cases where traditional in vitro evolution methods have failed (Liu & Nivon, PNAS, 2014) . Rosetta has also shown the ability to design nano-molar affinity small-molecule binders “de novo” into previously inactive scaffolds (Tinberg, Nature, 2013).
  
Protein-protein Interaction Design Rosetta is able to design novel target-protein-binding activity into a huge number of inactive protein scaffolds. The hemagluttinin (influenza virus) binder, HB36, was the first-in-class computationally designed nano-molar protein/protein binder (Fleishman, Science, 2011), and more recently a BHRF1-protein binder was demonstrated using Rosetta (Procko, Cell, 2014).




CORE TECHNOLOGY: ROSETTA

Rosetta has been developed over the past 16 years, beginning at the lab of Prof. David Baker at the University of Washington, and at over 30 other labs around the world. Rosetta began as a tool for protein modeling, combining knowledge-based and physical modeling approaches with a consistent focus on actionable experimental results. Over the last 10 years Rosetta has evolved into the world-leading tool for computational protein design.






 SamplingRosetta primarily uses Monte Carlo based sampling using knowledge of protein structure from the protein data bank (pdb). Protein backbones are primarily modeled using “fragments” derived from the pdb using an array of powerful bioinformatics tools, for example BLAST — all of which is built in to Cyrus Bench behind the scenes. Protein sidechains are modeled using the now 30-year-old “rotamer” concept, with constant refinement over the years.

 ScoringRosetta uses a combination of physical and knowledge-derived potentials to score proteins during modeling and design. For example, a physics-based coulombic potentials is employed, and statistically-derived hydrogen bonding potential. Each protocol is highly tuned on large amounts of experimental data, often with custom scoring methods, and has been tested multiple times in real experimental contexts. For example a method to predict mutational free energies (Kellogg et al, Proteins, 2011) is tuned on large experimental datasets before deployment in Bench.
