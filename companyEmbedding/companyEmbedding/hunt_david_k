5 MB|16 pagesProduct DescriptionThis packet includes all you will need for a fun first week of school activity to get your new or returning students acquainted with the school.  After reading a picture book favorite, David Goes to School! or No, David!  Share the letter from David to the students about how they will be searching for his clues around the school.  Simply hang up the David clue cards and their matching messages prior to the hunt.  Have your class go searching for the clues and discuss how David acts at each spot.  Have David's actions lead a discussion about smart choices to be made at different parts of the school.  With these clue cards, you can visit the:

1. Library
2. Gym
3. Cafeteria
4. Art/Music room
5. Office
6. Playground
7. Nurse's Office
8. Classroom

When your hunt is completed, have students discuss appropriate behavior and smart choices at school back in the classroom that David did not do.  Have students complete one of the two response sheets to show they understand smart choices they need to make in different parts of the school.

Product Description▼▲
Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views provides a unique venue for well-known proponents of four distinct views in the openness of God debate to present their case. Paul Helm of King's College, London, presents the Augustinian/Calvinistic view. David Hunt of Whittier College contends for a simple foreknowledge view. William Lane Craig of Talbot School of Theology argues for middle knowledge, or Molinism, and Gregory A. Boyd of Bethel College presents the openness view.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The question of the nature of God's foreknowledge and how that relates to human freedom has been pondered and debated by Christian theologians at least since the time of Augustine. And the issue will not go away. More recently, the terms of the debate have shifted, and the issue has taken on new urgency with the theological proposal known as the openness of God. This view maintains that God's knowledge, while perfect, is limited regarding the future inasmuch as the future is "open" and not settled. Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views provides a venue for well-known proponents of four distinct views of divine foreknowledge to present their cases: Gregory A. Boyd of Bethel College presents the open-theism view, David Hunt of Whittier College weighs in on the simple-foreknowledge view, William Lane Craig of Talbot School of Theology takes the middle-knowledge view, and Paul Helm of Regent College, Vancouver, presents the Augustinian-Calvinist view. All four respond to each of the other essayists, noting points of agreement and disagreement. Editors James K. Beilby and Paul R. Eddy introduce the contemporary debate and also offer a conclusion that helps you evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each view. The result is a unique opportunity to grapple with the issues and arguments and frame your own understanding of this important debate.

Publisher's Weekly▼▲
The recent evangelical debate about divine foreknowledge has  been compared to 
the inerrancy debate of the 1970s because of  its heatedness; this collection 
attempts to offer several  viewpoints on the basic controversies (i.e., what 
did God know,  when did he know it and do human beings really have free will?). 
 But in bringing together these four authors Gregory Boyd with  the open view, 
David Hunt with the simple-foreknowledge view,  William Lane Craig with the 
middle-foreknowledge view and Paul  Helm defending the Augustinian-Calvinist 
view the collection  illustrates another similarity with the inerrancy debate: 
a  mind-numbing complexity of argument. The editors have sought "to  make this 
book accessible to educated laypeople and college  students who have had a 
first course in theology or philosophy."  While Boyd's essay is very 
accessible, the others are filled  with technical terms ("while it seems clear 
that intramundane  causation is transitive") and a puzzling tendency to speak 
in  algebraic variables ("If it is accidentally necessary before X  is even 
born that X will do A, then X never has it in his power  to do other than 
A..."). Needing over seven pages of glossary,  this book is unlikely to find a 
wide audience, but it will still  prove useful for those seminarians and clergy 
who wish to get  several different perspectives on the debate. (Nov.)

            I like the way that this book is set up. Each writer presents their view and the others critique it. I love the contrasting opinions and it has been very helpful to my study on this topic. Definitely a good place to start!

            This book on Divine Foreknowledge cuts rightinto the heart of the debate about God'sknowledge of the future since it dealswith specifics on what and how God knows the future. This book is advanced and requires a lot of rigorous logical thinking to read it through since there are logical equations and syllogisms in each author's explanation of his own particular viewpoint. No other book that I know will take you THIS DEEP into the questions aboutwhat and how God knows the future. One person I know who read an easierversion of this topic (the bookPREDESTINATION AND FREE WILL)had remarked thatthe P AND FW book is like eating McDonald's, but the DIVINE FOREKNOWLEDGE book is likesitting down to full course steak dinner.Buy DF if you dare!
