Interesting Facts
Father, Donald Fisher, recalled that John was anxious when he heard rumors that the baseball team, San Francisco Giants, was moving to Florida. The Fisher family eventually became part owners of the team. Years later, their stake was sold to mutual fund executive Harmon Burns for an undisclosed amount, with Fisher retaining a minor stake, to monitor the team's financials. He later sold the stake in order to purchase a stake in the Oakland Athletics, since major league baseball regulations prohibit owning stakes in two teams simultaneously.
