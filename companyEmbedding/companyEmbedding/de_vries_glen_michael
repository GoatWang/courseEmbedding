  Transforming clinical trials for sponsors, sites and patients






 


  Leadership

Our journey started in 1999 when a lab scientist, founder Glen de Vries, looked for a way to make clinical trials run better.  With a SaaS technology solution taking shape, he connected with businessman Tarek Sherif to start a company that would focus solely on advancing clinical testing.  Today, that same entrepreneurial spirit and passion for innovation is transforming clinical development across the globe through our 1,000+ team and widespread client and partner network.

  Clients & Partners

We're proud to be part of a global ecosystem of over 400 clients—emerging biotechs, global pharma companies, cutting-edge device and diagnostic companies, innovative academic research sites, broad-mandate government agencies and others—who use our platform every day.  We've supported more than 9,000 clinical trials, 200,000 sites and two million trial volunteers with the infrastructure and insights to bring their new treatments to the public.  Further extending our reach, over 50 top contract research organizations around the world deliver our solutions to their clients.

  Corporate Social Responsibility

We believe our commitment to transforming the life sciences industry should extend beyond our product solutions. Through both employee and company efforts, we want to have a positive impact on research, education, public health and environmental sustainability. It is our vision to be one of the leaders in corporate social responsibility in both the life sciences and technology sectors.

  Get to know us


 

Medidata’s journey started in 1999 when a scientist working on his first clinical trial waded through inefficiencies and delays—and knew that technology could improve the process. Almost 15 years later, we've grown to be the leader in clinical technology, with over 1,000 people working towards the same goal: Using the latest technology to help our life science clients bring their life-saving new treatments to the public.
With our single focus on clinical development in life sciences, our team provides applications, analytics and benchmarks that not only make the current trial process run better, but also transform it into a more efficient, productive and high-quality enterprise. Medidata is committed to providing all members of the clinical trial team—pharma researchers, physicians, patients—with the most advanced tools for planning and managing their clinical trials, generating value for clients with trials that run faster, with less risk and with fewer resources.
Welcome to Medidata Solutions.

Where is Glen  now?
						President, Medidata Solutions Worldwide
						Updated October 12, 2012
					

By Barbara Benson
The self-described nerdiest kid at science summer camp, Glen de Vries grew up to be one successful geek. The software-savvy Manhattan native co-founded Medidata a decade ago, after he developed technology that improved the process of scientific research.Medidata, which specializes in the electronic collection and management of data from clinical trials, now boasts a 700-person global staff in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. It has grown into one of the largest freestanding software companies in New York City. Following its initial public offering last June—one of the few IPOs by a New York company during the recession—it has just reported net revenue for 2009 of $140.4 million, up 33% compared with 2008 levels."It's really about what we can do that will improve science," says Mr. de Vries, who studied probabilistic algorithms at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and has a degree in molecular biology and genetics from Carnegie Mellon."He's absolutely brilliant," says Tarek Sherif, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company. "He's open-minded, and he's very gregarious."Mr. de Vries sees the firm's mission as finding the most advantageous way for customers to get their product to market. If there's a race among drugmakers, "our job is to make the Medidata customer win," he says.Mr. de Vries, a ballroom dancer and a marathoner, loves a challenge. When Medidata entered the Japanese market, he joked that he would return one year later and make a presentation in Japanese. He did just that—although, he concedes, "my bar Japanese is probably better than my business Japanese."
