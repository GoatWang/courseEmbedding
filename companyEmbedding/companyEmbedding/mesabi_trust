About Mesabi Trust

Mesabi Trust is a royalty trust organized under the laws of the State of New York in 1961 to derive income from an iron mine (the Peter Mitchell Mine) located near Babbitt, Minnesota, at the eastern end of the Mesabi Iron Range. Under various agreements the mine is operated by Northshore Mining Company (“Northshore”), a subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (“CCI”). Northshore mines the ore, which is in the form of taconite, a hard rock containing approximately 21% recoverable iron, crushes it, separates the iron particles from the non-metallic, and forms the resulting concentrate into pellets which are shipped for use in steel-producing blast furnaces of customers of CCI, an international mining company, the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America. 


Northshore pays royalties to the Trust primarily based on the selling price of pellets shipped from Northshore’s pellet plant at Silver Bay, Minnesota, on Lake Superior approximately 45 miles from the mine, plus a significantly smaller royalty based on tons of ore extracted at the mine. Information about the reserve capacity and current pellet production of the mine can be found in the Trust’s most current Annual Report on From 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and available through the “SEC Filings” tab on this website. 


The Trust is publicly held, and units of beneficial interest are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “MSB.” The Trust is a pass-through entity and its revenues are not taxed to the Trust but are taxed to the unitholders. As a condition to the Trust not being taxed as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes, the Trust is not permitted to engage in any business other than the collection and distribution of royalties and payment of expenses. 


While there are a number of documents affecting the Trust, the mine and lands owned by the Trust adjacent to the mine, the two most significant documents are the Agreement of Trust dated July 18, 1961, as amended October 25, 1982, which provides for the management and administration of the Trust, and the Amendment of Assignment, Assumption and Further Assignment of Peters Lease dated August 17, 1989, which provides for the mining, processing and sale of iron ore products by Northshore and the payment of royalties to the Trust based on those sales. The payment of royalties, consisting of base royalties, bonus royalties and, at times, a minimum advance royalty, is quite detailed and is described more fully in the Trust’s most current Annual Report on From 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and available through the “SEC Filings” tab on this website. 


The Agreement of Trust has a duration ending 21 years after the death of the last survivor of 25 individuals living at the inception of the Trust, all of whom are named in an exhibit to the Agreement of Trust and were alive several years ago when the Trustees investigated this matter. The Amendment of Assignment has a duration ending when the reserves of minerals which are the subject of that agreement are exhausted.

					Full Description



Mesabi Trust, incorporated in 1961, is a royalty trust. The purpose of the Trust is to conserve and protect the Trust Estate. The Trust operates in the iron ore mining segment. The Trust derives income from the Peter Mitchell Mine, an iron mine located near Babbitt, Minnesota, at the eastern end of the Mesabi Iron Range. The lessee/operator of Mesabi Trust's mineral interests is Northshore Mining Corporation (NMC), a subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (Cliffs). NMC produces iron ore from Mesabi Trust Lands for the manufacture of iron ore products to be sold to various customers of Cliffs. Mesabi Trust receives royalties on the crude ore extracted from such lands and the pellets produced from such crude ore.The Mesabi Trust's principal assets consist of two different interests in certain properties in the Mesabi Iron Range: Mesabi Trust's interest as assignor in the Amended Assignment of Peters Lease and the Amended Assignment of Cloquet Lease, which together cover properties aggregating approximately 9,750 contiguous acres in St. Louis County, Minnesota (the Peters Lease Lands and the Cloquet Lease Lands), and Mesabi Trust's ownership of the entire beneficial interest in the Mesabi Land Trust, which has interest as fee owner in the Peters Lease Lands and a fee ownership in certain non-mineral-bearing lands adjacent to the Peters and Cloquet Lease Lands (the Mesabi Lease Lands, together with Mesabi Trust Lands, the Trust Estate). The Peters Lease Lands and the Cloquet Lease Lands are located at the northeastern end of the Mesabi Iron Range and contain mineral deposits consisting of a metamorphosed sedimentary bed of banded magnetite in siliceous gangue, a form of low-grade iron ore known as taconite.The Trust Estate, including the ore mine, are located in northeastern Minnesota, approximately two miles south of Babbitt, Minnesota. The ore mine on the Trust Estate is called the Peter Mitchell Mine, an open pit mine consisting of approximately 10-mile long segment of a host rock called the Biwabik Iron Formation. The Biwabik Iron Formation extends west and southwest for over 100 miles and constitutes the Mesabi Iron Range.

The Market Fails To Recognize Option Value Of Mesabi Trust's Royalty Income - Mesabi Trust (NYSE:MSB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Market Fails To Recognize Option Value Of Mesabi Trust's Royalty IncomeSep. 9.16 | About: Mesabi Trust (MSB) Konrad Lisowski Long only, value, growth at reasonable price, long-term horizonSummaryMesabi Trust boasts a very low fixed cost base and exceptionally high quality of earnings, which are all ultimately distributed to unitholders;Market seems to assume current iron ore pricing environment to persist, while missing the optionality embedded in Mesabi’s royalty income stream;Long-term, Mesabi’s future is challenged by the decreasing U.S. blast furnace steel production;I expect Mesabi to yield between 5% and 13% per annum, with the former representing a worst-case scenario of gradual decline of U.S. blast furnace steel production.Company Mesabi Trust (NYSE:MSB) ("Mesabi" or the "Trust") is a trust, which holds interests in 9,750 acres of iron ore bearing land located in the St. Louis County, Minnesota. Trust's revenues derive from royalty payments by Northshore Mining Company ("Northshore"), a fully owned subsidiary of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE:CLF) ("Cliffs"), which is the current operator of the open pit Peter Mitchell Mine, located on Trust land, near Babbitt, Minnesota. The iron ore bearing taconite is crushed on site for reduction into 4-inch size coarse ore and transported by rail to Northshore's pelletizing facility in Silver Bay, Minnesota, at the banks of Lake Superior. After the ore is reduced in size again by fine crushers and grinders, it is separated magnetically from the non-ore bearing material, put in the floatation cells for concentration, filtered and pelletized into green balls of 0-1/4 to 0-1/2 inch in diameter. Finally, the green balls are heated in furnaces to over 2,400°F and hardened into the final pellet product, ready for shipment by lake-going vessels from the Silver Bay harbor. The pellets are then sold, predominantly to North American steel producers, as inputs for their blast furnaces. Figure 1. Location of the Trust estate 


 Source: Mesabi Mesabi itself is not involved in mining operations. Its activities are limited to conserving the Trust estate, collecting royalty income and distributing it to unitholders. Mesabi operates on a very limited base of largely fixed costs (e.g. 88% net income margin in FY16) and needs no capex, which is all covered by Northshore. The Trust itself is not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Instead, Trust's income is taxable directly to the unitholders, who need to report their share of Trust income to the IRS individually, regardless of whether any distributions are actually paid by the Trust or not. Mesabi was formed in 1961 under the laws of the State of New York. Its duration is limited to 21 years after the death of the last of 25 persons named in the exhibit to the trust agreement. According to 2014 investigation conducted by the Trust, many of those individuals are still alive and the youngest of them is 55, so the trust is likely to exist for another 50+ years. In 2015 proven and probable iron ore mineral reserves were estimated by Northshore at 264.3m tons of saleable product, which allows for another 44 years of production even at maximum capacity of 6.0m tons annually. These reserves were estimated by Cliffs at a price of USD 96 per ton. They would certainly be much lower under current iron ore prices, but would still suffice for at least another 20 years, average remaining life for all Cliffs mines stated in its 10-K filings. With 2015 direct cash production cost of USD 54.4/ton Cliffs' U.S. iron ore mining operations are at the verge of the 4th quartile of the lowest cost iron ore miners worldwide. Figure 2. Iron ore cash cost curve 


 Source: Rio Tinto, based on WoodMac This means that when iron ore prices are low, Northshore operation becomes unprofitable and should rationally be expected to be idled. This happened most recently, between November 2015 and May 2016. Similarly, before Northshore became mine operator, the mine was idle for 3 years between 1986 and 1989. Financials In the FY ending on January 31, 2016 Mesabi generated USD 9.7m in revenues, and USD 8.5m of net income (margin of 88%). This were the weakest result of Mesabi for at least 10 years and could largely be attributable to low volume of iron ore pellet shipments from Silver Bay, partly due to operations idling between November and the end of the year on January 31, 2016. Figure 3. Mesabi's long term statutory financials 

 Source: Own calculations based on Mesabi's 10-K filings Looked at from a long-term perspective financial performance of Mesabi is nothing but impressive. The revenue figure predominantly depends on the volume of shipments but is also impacted by selling prices of the final product realized by Northshore, as will further be explained below, when we estimate normal cash flow for Mesabi. The costs are low (average of 4% of revenue within the last 10 years) and conversion of net income to free cash flow is truly phenomenal (average of 99% for the last 10 years). Obviously, the risk that begs to be addressed is further sustainability of the Northshore business, which Mesabi depends on for the royalty payments, particularly given the 63% decline in revenue in 2016 and the recent temporary idling of Northshore operations. We will address this issue in the Key Risks section below. Current valuation multiples Assuming the current level of earnings is here to stay, the market values the Trust to yield 5.0-6.5% annually.
 Figure 4. Current P/E multiples for Mesabi 

 Source: Own calculations based on Mesabi's 10-K and 10-Q filings One might argue that given the current 10Y U.S. government bond yields of ~1.5% and the equity risk premium of ~5.5-6.0%, a P/E multiple of 13-15x would be a better indication of where the fair value of the Trust is. My opinion is the higher multiple is probably well deserved, since we are talking here about extremely high quality earnings, almost certain to be distributed to unitholders in full. In other words, 5.0-6.5% is in my opinion not a bad dividend yield at all. The main point of this short discussion of current valuation is to understand why the market perceives the value of the Trust as it does. My theory would be the following: the market expects Mesabi for the foreseeable future to earn what it did in FY16 or during the last twelve months; the market fears that Northshore will temporarily idle its operations again, or will discontinue it permanently; the market recognizes high quality of Mesabi earnings and awards it a premium multiple vs. what would normally be considered fair value. At current valuation, the market seems to completely ignore the substantial optionality embedded in Mesabi's revenue stream. Before we estimate the value resulting from optionality, let us look at normal cash flow for Mesabi, if current market conditions continue. Normal cash flow level Mesabi's royalty revenues can be divided into: (NYSE:I) base overriding royalties, (ii) bonus royalties, (NASDAQ:III) minimum advance royalties, and (iv) fee royalties. Figure 5. Mesabi's royalty income structure 


 Source: Mesabi's 10-K filing for FY16 Base overriding royalties are calculated as percentage of gross sales proceeds of iron ore pellets shipped from Silver Bay. The applicable percentage is gradually increasing from 2.5% for the first one million tons to 6% for more than four million tons shipped. Mesabi reports in its 10-K filings both volume of iron ore products shipped from Silver Bay and the value of base overriding royalties due. Assuming no differences in realized prices throughout the year, this allows us to estimate to a high degree of certainty the average price of products shipped by Northshore from Silver Bay, which is reported neither by Mesabi, nor by Cliffs and will come very useful later on, when we estimate the value resulting from optionality. Figure 6. Normalization of Mesabi's base overriding royalties and average realized prices 

 Source: Own calculations based on Mesabi's 10-K filings Average price realized by Cliffs in Q2/16 in its U.S. iron ore operations, including Northshore, was lower than the average FY15 price by ~2%. Applying that relationship to iron ore pellets shipped from Silver Bay, we receive an estimate of the most recent price for iron ore products attributable to Mesabi of USD 53.22 per ton. At average annual shipment volume of 4.3m in FY03-Q1/17 this translates to USD 9.8m of normalized base overriding royalties, under current market conditions. Bonus royalties arise when iron ore products shipped from Silver Bay are sold at prices per ton above a threshold price. Similarly to base overriding royalties, they are calculated as percentage of gross proceeds of product shipped. The applicable percentages are presented below. Figure 7. Bonus royalty schedule
 

 Source: Mesabi's 10-K filing for FY16 The threshold price for the 2016 calendar year is USD 53.80 per ton and is adjusted annually for inflation. Since the threshold price is higher than the current price of iron ore products shipped from Silver Bay, which we estimated at USD 53.22, no bonus payments should rationally be expected as long as current market conditions prevail. Minimum advance royalties are payable by Northshore regardless of the amount of iron ore products shipped from Silver Bay. They are deductible from base overriding royalties and bonus royalties, which is why they are not typically recognized as sales revenue. The minimum advance royalties for 2016 are set at ~USD 897k, which would cover roughly 70% of the maximum annual trust expenses incurred within the last 10 years, and are subject to adjustment for inflation. The minimum advance royalties are due even if operations are idled. Since we expect Mesabi to earn base overriding royalties, no minimum advance royalties should be expected under the current price environment. Fee royalties have historically constituted a smaller component of the Trust's total royalty income. They are payable by Northshore to Mesabi Land Trust, another trust beneficially controlled by Mesabi. The royalties depend on the amount of crude ore mined (i.e. not shipments of iron ore pellets as for other royalty income streams) and the agreed price per ton, subject to certain indexing. For our purposes we can assume the royalties will amount to ~USD 120k per million tons of iron ore pellets shipped, as was the case in FY16, which translates to a ~USD 0.5m annually under the long-term average shipment volume of 4.3m tons. Trust expenses have historically been growing steadily from USD 0.8m in FY06 to USD 1.2m in FY16, for an annual growth rate of 3.2%. We will assume the USD 1.2m per annum to represent normal level of Trust expenses.
 Now we have all we need to estimate the normal level of Mesabi cash flow under current market conditions. Probability of operation idling is something we can try to estimate as well. We know the Peter Mitchel Mine was closed by Reserve Mining Company, the original lessee, on July 31, 1986. It was then purchased by Cyprus Minerals Company on August 17, 1989, which restarted the operations under the Cyprus NMC name. The operation was finally acquired by Cliffs in 1994 and the name changed to Northshore. Another period of operations fully idling was the 5.5 months between the end of November 2015 and May 15, 2016. This gives us a total of 42 months since August 1986, or ~12% of the time the operation was idle until now. This does not account for the time the operation remained active immediately prior to August 1986, under Reserve Mining Company. With that, we have everything we need to calculate the normal level of Mesabi cash flow. Figure 8. Estimated normal cash flow under current market conditions 

 Source: Own calculations The resulting normal cash flow of USD 8.1m annually, represents a yield of 5.8% at USD 10.50 per unit, already taking into account the risk of operation idling. This still takes no account of the valuable option-like characteristics of Mesabi's royalty structure. Mesabi as real option on the price of iron ore Current prices realized by Northshore on iron ore products shipped from Silver Bay, which we estimated at USD 53.22 per ton, are just below this year's threshold price of USD 53.80 per ton, which if exceeded, would trigger the payment of bonus royalties. The higher the price, the larger percentage of selling price achieved by Northshore would be payable to Mesabi. Obviously, since the bonus royalties will not be paid in the current price environment anyway, any further decrease in iron prices has no direct effect on Mesabi's cash flow. The more variable the future iron ore prices, the more valuable for Mesabi this asymmetry in payoffs.
 Another source of optionality embedded in Mesabi is production volume, which also tends to increase with iron ore prices. This is logical, as the more profitable Northshore operation is, the stronger its drive to sell more. On the other hand, the lower the margins are, the stronger the incentives for Northshore to idle one, two, or even all four of its furnaces at the Silver Bay pelletizing plant. Since cash production cost does not directly depend on the iron ore price, we can use the iron ore prices we estimated in Figure 6 above as proxy for the profitability of the Northshore operation and see how it relates to shipment volume. Figure 9. Volume of shipments from Silver Bay vs. estimated selling price realized by Northshore 

 Source: Own calculations based on Mesabi's 10-K filings Put simply, if the average net income of USD 19.9m in FY03-FY16 represents normal earning power of Mesabi, price of USD 10.50 per share translates into a yield of 14.4%, much higher than the 5.8% we estimated above under the assumption that current market conditions are here to stay. This 14-year period covers a broad range of market environments, with realized iron ore prices ranging from USD 29 to USD 93 per ton. This approach to estimating yield is in my opinion by no means an oversimplification. It seems to me to be a much better proxy of future yields, than assuming no changes in iron ore prices whatsoever. Still, we can do better than that and cross check this first approximation with what results from a proper real option valuation using the binomial tree approach. First, we need to build a binomial tree of future iron ore prices realized by Northshore. To do that, I estimated the volatility of iron ore product prices realized by Northshore at ~26% annually and used a risk free rate of ~1.5%. Further, I assumed that:
 Northshore will idle its operations whenever the prices fall below its Q2/16 production cash cost for U.S. iron ore operations of USD 46.32 per ton, meaning that only minimum advance royalty payments will be due in such a case; Northshore will discontinue the operation altogether, if prices remain below the break-even point for more than one year, with no royalties due in such a case; Both base overriding royalties and bonus royalty payments will be due if the price exceeds current threshold level of USD 53.80 per ton; Only base overriding royalties will be due at iron ore product prices of between USD 46.32 and USD 53.80 per ton. Figure 10. Binomial tree of iron ore product prices realized by Northshore 

 Source: Own calculations Now, we need the volumes of iron ore products shipped by Northshore from Silver Bay at each of the price points. Here, I assumed the following: Relationship between volume of iron ore shipped from Silver Bay (NYSE:V) and realized iron ore price (NYSE:P) is: V = 0.013 x P + 3.64; Maximum of 5.5 m tons, as in FY11; No iron ore is shipped in years, when Northshore operations are idled or discontinued. This gives us the following binomial tree of iron ore product shipment volumes: Figure 11. Binomial tree of iron ore product shipment volumes from Silver Bay 

 Source: Own calculations With realized iron ore product prices and volume of shipments, we are ready to estimate cash flows for each of the nodes.
 Figure 12. Binomial tree of Mesabi's cash flows 

 Source: Own calculations Finally, I assume a P/E multiple of ~13.7x to estimate residual value 10 years from now, a multiple I would consider fair at current interest rate level, given an equity risk premium of ~5.8%. We discount the resulting residual values back to present at a risk free rate of ~1.5%, adding back all interim cash flows. With that we arrive at the valuation of Mesabi of USD 314.6m, or USD 24.0 per unit. Figure 13. Valuation of Mesabi using real options 

 Source: Own calculations This price represents fair value for a risk neutral investor, able to hedge the underlying iron ore price changes and happy to earn the risk free rate of ~1.5% annually. For an investor striving to earn more than the risk free return fair value is obviously lower. My estimate of the annual pre-tax return at USD 10.5 per Trust unit is 13.2%. This is not far from our first approximation using Mesabi's average net income in FY03-FY16. Below I have presented a simple sensitivity analysis of returns at different price points and P/E multiples assumed for calculation of residual value. Figure 14. Sensitivity analysis of expected annual pre-tax returns 


 Source: Own calculations U.S. steel market The key driver of demand for Northshore's iron ore products is U.S. blast furnace steel production. In 2015 U.S. production of crude steel amounted to ~79m tons, representing ~5% of global production. U.S. steel production capacity utilization was ~72%, compared to a 2009-2015 range of 52% - 77%. In 2015 U.S. steel producers using blast furnaces produced 29.2m tons of raw steel, or 37% of total steel produced in the country. The 11 integrated mills, which form core group of Cliffs' existing or prospective clients, are owned by only 3 groups: U.S. Steel, AK Steel and ArcelorMittal. The latter two are already Cliffs' largest customers. Blast furnace steel production has been decreasing at a rate of 2% per annum since 1991. If this trend continues, U.S. blast furnace steel production will be half of what it is today in ~30 years. The remaining 63% of steel in the U.S. in 2015 was produced in 110 mini-mills, operating electric arc furnaces and using iron and steel scrap, rather than iron ore, as feedstock. This group, constituting of a total of 58 steel producers, is unlikely to form a potential client base for Cliffs. The share of steel produced in electric arc furnaces increases, as recycling is becoming more profitable and convenient and environmental regulations for primary production increase. Behind the increased imports and reduced production of steel in blast furnaces is the global production overcapacity. U.S. steel producers have to compete with cheaper steel imports from China. U.S. net imports of steel mill products in 2015 amounted to 28m tons, representing 25% of apparent steel consumption. In 2016, Cliffs expects these conditions to improve as new duties on steel should curb the steel imports entering the U.S., but it seems that regulations are the only form of competitive moat protecting U.S. integrated steel companies from lower cost competitors. Global steel and iron ore markets China with ~804m tons of crude steel and a market share of ~50% was world's largest crude steel producer in 2015. Despite a 2% decrease in steel production from an all-time high of 823m tons in 2014, the 2006-15 CAGR is still at over 7%. What happens with Chinese steel production, determines steel and iron ore prices worldwide, in turn affecting the demand for U.S. iron ore and economics of Northshore's operations.
 Throughout 2015, the iron ore price has been driven down by a combination of reduced domestic steel demand from China and higher global production of low cost iron ore, which increased by ~300m tons since 2012 and is expected to grow by another ~100m tons by the end of 2017 in Australia and Brazil alone. As a result of lower prices, ~200m tons of higher cost iron ore capacity was idled between 2014 and 2015, most notably in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Sweden, the U.S., and western Africa. Figure 15. Long-term inflation adjusted iron ore prices (1962-2016) 

 Note: Nominal prices for 2015 and 2016 and real prices for the previous years; 2016 represents a mean until June 13th, 2016. Source: Vale Even if we assume that current growth rates of Chinese economy represent a new normal, current iron ore prices of ~USD 50 per ton still look somewhat low compared to the inflation adjusted prices prevailing before 2000. U.S. iron ore market According to U.S. Geological Survey data, 3.3bn tons of iron ore were produced in the world in 2015. U.S. with 43m tons was ranked 8th in the world, following China with 1.4bn tons, Australia with 824m tons and Brazil with 428m tons. Different than for steel, U.S. is actually a net exporter of iron ore. It exported 8.1m tons in 2015 and imported 4.2m tons, mainly from Canada and Brazil. U.S. iron ore production has been declining since 1991 at an annual rate of ~1.2%. For the last 10 years the declines accelerated to 2.4% annually. Within the U.S. 98% of iron ore in 2015 was mined in Michigan and Minnesota. 12 iron ore mines (9 open pits and 3 reclamation operations) and 3 iron metallic plants, including direct-reduced iron (NYSE:DRI) and iron nugget producers, operated during the year.
 Given the pressure on costs resulting from low seaborne iron ore prices, the industry continued efforts to reduce labour costs. Producers in Minnesota, including Northshore, decreased operational costs because utility companies reduced electricity rates and the State reduced royalty payments on a temporary basis. A new trade agreement with countries in Asia and import duties on steel products for 11 countries, which were implemented in 2015, is expected to alleviate the situation. Cliffs' competitive position All U.S. iron ore mines have a rated capacity to produce 58.4m tons of iron ore pellets. Cliffs is the dominant U.S. producer, with an annual rated capacity of the mines it operates at 32.9m tons. Northshore, with 6.0m tons per annum represents ~10% of the total U.S. pellet production capacity. Cliffs directly competes with steel companies that own interests in iron ore mines in the U.S. and/or Canada and with major iron ore pellet exporters from Eastern Canada and Brazil. Cliffs' U.S. competitors include U.S. Steel (two mines with a total capacity of 19.7m tons), Magnetation (3.0m tons) and ArcelorMittal (2.8m tons). ArcellorMittal is also Cliffs' largest client, responsible for 49% of U.S. iron ore sales revenue in 2015. At first glance this seems risky, as when demand for iron ore pellet is reduced, ArcelorMittal should be inclined to cut supply from Cliffs' before it reduces its own pellet production. On the other hand, the competition between the U.S. pellet producers does not seem to be fierce. Both ArcelorMittal (Empire and Hibbing mines) and U.S. Steel (Tilden and Hibbing mines) are Cliff's partners in selected mining and pelletizing operations. Iron ore pellet production is a commodity business, with many of the factors affecting its profitability, beyond Cliffs' control. Cliffs might well be a low cost producer of iron ore pellets in the U.S. market with transportation and logistics advantages to serve the U.S. steel market, but the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. integrated steel industry is in question and forms one of the most significant long-term risks to the viability of the Northshore business.
 Worst case scenario: U.S. blast furnaces close, thus eliminating the demand for U.S. mined iron ore U.S. blast furnace steel production has been decreasing at a CAGR of 2.0% between 1991 and 2015. The decreases accelerated to 3.7% within the last 10 years. U.S. iron ore mining proved a bit more resistant with annual decrease rates at 1.2% and 2.4% for the last 24 and for the last 10 years respectively. China is world's largest net exporter of steel. It exports ~100m tons of steel more than it imports, creating pressure on other steel producing countries and driving their steel mills out of the business. U.S. is world's largest net importer of steel. It imports over 25m tons of steel more than it exports. Naturally oversupply of steel produced in China impacts production capacity utilization in the U.S. Chinese net exports account for ~12% of Chinese annual steel production. If Chinese GDP grows at 6%, a bit below current rates, and no new steel production comes online, the oversupply issue should be gone in just 2 years. There still remains a problem of unutilized production capacity in China and elsewhere globally that could flood the market with steel anytime. Global production capacity of steel was estimated by OECD at 2.2bn tons in 2014 and was expected to increase to 2.4bn tons in 2017. Demand for steel stood at 1.6bn tons in 2013 and was expected to grow at 2% annually. If we translate that into utilization rates, we get 75% in 2014, actually increasing to 76% in 2017. This is not far from 80% that would be considered very respectable and could be reached by 2019, assuming no new capacity is added to the market. It seems that the overcapacity problem is real, but despite widespread concerns over its highest level ever in nominal terms, it is actually not that severe and gradually decreasing. Even in an environment, where oversupply of steel persists, U.S. steelmakers still have a chance. New import duties on steel products from 11 countries, were enacted in 2015. The duties go as high as 250%. According to Wall Street Journal, this already resulted in the U.S. benchmark hot-rolled coil index rising more than 60% in 5M/16 to USD 615 per ton, after falling 33% in 2015. For illustration, in Europe, the benchmark index was up by only 34%. The U.S. price is still ~70% above the Chinese price of USD 361 per ton. The demise of U.S. steel industry would create politically unwelcome problems. No government likes to see steelworkers demonstrating on the streets and blaming it for their lost jobs, so it is possible the tariffs are here to stay for as long, as global oversupply continues. Relying on subsidies or protective tariffs is a poor business strategy that usually proves unsustainable in the long-term, but it is exactly what enables U.S. steelmakers to stay in business as things stand now.
 Even if the tariffs are not there and the oversupply continues, as long as U.S. car manufacturers and other major users of steel decide to prefer U.S. producers, U.S. iron ore industry will be able to thrive. The preference for U.S. produced steel could be due to its marketing appeal to final customers, shorter time to market, or better quality control. Iron ore could also be used to produce pellets that in turn could serve as feedstock for producing steel in electric arc furnaces, less vulnerable to foreign competition. To build a worst-case scenario, I have assumed Northshore production attributable to Mesabi lands to decrease by at 3.7% per annum. This is the rate at which the U.S. steel production in blast furnaces has been decreasing for the last 10 years and much faster than the 2.4% per annum the iron ore production has been falling in the same period. This also impacts the multiple used for calculating residual value in 10 years. I believe a P/E multiple of 9.1x would be fair for a business declining at this pace. After including these assumptions in the calculation of volume of iron ore products presented in Figure 11, we get a new binomial tree of expected cash flows, which allows us to estimate the fair value of one unit of Mesabi at USD 13.77. Figure 16. Binomial tree of Mesabi cash flows 

 Source: Own calculations Again, this is the value for a risk neutral investor, satisfied with achieving the risk free return rate. Price of USD 10.50 per Trust unit, would represent a worst-case scenario yield of 5.5%. Figure 17. Sensitivity analysis of expected annual pre-tax returns 


 Source: Own calculations Risk of Northshore being squeezed out of the market by increasing global supply of low cost iron ore Volume of iron ore production in the U.S. has been declining by 1.2% annually for the last 24 years, which accelerated to 2.4% during the last 10 years. The declines have been a bit less steep at Northshore, but still of similar magnitude. As already explained, the decreases result from reduced demand from U.S. steelmakers employing blast furnaces. Due to transportation costs, the same barrier that protects Minnesota iron ore mining against influx of lower cost iron ore from Brazil and China, the ore will not be able to effectively compete beyond those territories of U.S. and Canada adjacent to the Great Lakes. Cliffs' balance sheet is extremely weak. Its net debt stands at north of USD 2.7bn, which is more than 10x its EBITDA for the last twelve months ending on June 30, 2016. At this level, Cliffs barely affords to pay its interests on debt. Compare USD 137m of EBITDA in H1/16 to USD 108m of net interest expense. This is still before actually repaying any loans. Now imagine what happens if interest rates increase. Cliffs is currently conducting a share issue, to repay part of its debt. It expects to raise between USD 288m and USD 331m. If successful, the issue will bring Cliffs' net debt to ~9x LTM EBITDA, which barely makes any difference. Obviously Cliffs believes its financial results are depressed and bound to improve. Suffice to say its EBITDA in 2013 was more than USD 1.9bn. I am not trying to argue in favor or against the chances for Cliffs' successfully restructuring its business here. My point is simply that if Cliffs is wrong, and its financial performance stays close to where it is at the moment, bankruptcy is a real option and a significant risk for Mesabi. The difference between Cliffs' situation and that of Mesabi is that if Cliffs barely stays afloat, Mesabi can prosper. This might even be due to additional share issues, further diluting current Cliffs' shareholders. Another difference is that even if Cliffs goes under, Mesabi can still make it. I can envision a situation, in which Northshore is acquired by ArcelorMittal or U.S. Steel as part of the liquidation of Cliffs. Both of these companies already own interests in U.S. iron ore mines, some of which are operated by Cliffs. Restructuring like this would certainly take time but it certainly puts Mesabi unitholders in much better position than Cliffs' shareholders.
 I believe the risk of Cliffs' going out of business is properly recognized in the real option valuation we used to estimate Mesabi's value. Our assumption was that at iron ore prices lower than cash mining cost, Mesabi earns no royalties other than minimum advance royalties and when the situation persists for more than a year, no royalties whatsoever. Risk of current royalty fee structure renegotiation Although current royalty fee structure makes great sense for Mesabi, it may prove unsustainable for Cliffs, if current iron ore prices persist. Therefore, there is some risk of current royalty fees being modified. Bear in mind that two of Mesabi's four individual trustees are former Cliffs' executives, likely to hold Cliffs' interests dearly. However, there are two reasons I believe such a revision is not likely. Firstly, Cliffs' response to low iron ore prices was historically limiting production in its operations, including Northshore, or idling them. At low iron ore production volumes, let's say ~3.5m tons annually, base royalties add less than 4% to Cliffs' cash costs and bonus royalties are likely to be non-existent. Eliminating the royalties completely in an environment like this would save Cliffs' less than USD 10m. Even an extreme new deal like this, would in my opinion solve none of Cliffs' problems. Secondly, renegotiating the royalty structure would personally be very uncomfortable for the trustees, whose sole responsibility is to preserve the Trust assets. Approval by majority of unitholders would likely be required, which in my opinion makes it unlikely for Cliffs' to pursue, given the limited potential gains it might achieve. Conclusion Mesabi is a very attractive business, with no capex needs and the statutory mission obligation of passing all its earnings through to unitholders. At a price of USD 10.50 per unit, I would expect it to yield between 5% and 13% per annum, with the former representing a worst-case scenario, in which volume of iron ore mined declines at 3.7% per annum, as U.S. blast furnace steel production gradually dies out.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MESABI TRUST PRESS RELEASE
 
New York, New York
November 2, 2015
 
On October 29, 2015, the Trustees of Mesabi Trust (NYSE: MSB) received the quarterly royalty report for shipments of iron ore products from Silver Bay, Minnesota during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 from Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (Cliffs), the parent company of Northshore Mining Company (Northshore). As previously reported, because NYSE rules require 10 days advance notice of a record date for declarations of distributions, and Mesabi Trusts Agreement of Trust fixes a record date of October 30th, the Trustees were unable to timely consider the declaration of a distribution. Accordingly, the Trustees determined that no distribution was declared in October 2015 and, therefore, no distribution will be paid in November 2015.
 
On October 16, 2015, Cliffs informed the Mesabi Trustees that, unlike historical practice, the quarterly royalty report for shipments of iron ore products from Silver Bay, Minnesota during Northshores quarter ended September 30, 2015 would not be provided to Mesabi Trust until the end of October 2015. The Trustees plan to hold a regular quarterly trustees meeting in January 2016 to review the Trusts reserve balances and Cliffs quarterly royalty report, if available, for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and at that time, the Trustees will determine the amount of any distribution, if any, to be made to Unit holders of record as of January 30, 2016 (as provided in the Agreement of Trust), based upon all other information available at that time.
 
Neither Cliffs nor Northshore has provided Mesabi Trust with any projections about whether or not it will furnish future quarterly royalty reports on a timeline that will permit the Trustees to consider declarations of distributions from royalty revenues anticipated to be received by the 30th day of the month following each calendar quarter end.
 
As reported by Cliffs, based on shipments of iron ore products by Northshore during the three months ended September 30, 2015, Mesabi Trust has received a base royalty of $2,860,749.  Mesabi Trust also was paid a bonus royalty in the amount of $642,684, based on the average sales price per ton of iron ore pellets and the volume of shipments by Northshore during the third calendar quarter of 2015. Royalties paid to Mesabi Trust, however, reflected a reduction of $590,519 as a result of negative pricing adjustments to base and bonus royalty payments for shipments and royalty payments made in the first and second calendar quarters of 2015.  Accordingly, the total royalty payments received in October 2015 by Mesabi Trust from Northshore were $3,034,620 (which includes a royalty payment of $121,705 paid to the Mesabi Land Trust).
 
The royalties paid to Mesabi Trust are based on the volume of shipments of iron ore pellets for the quarter and the year to date, the pricing of the iron ore product sales, and the percentage of iron ore pellet shipments from Mesabi Trust lands rather than from non-Mesabi Trust lands.  In the third calendar quarter of 2015, Northshore credited Mesabi Trust with 1,231,310 tons of iron ore, as compared to 2,115,189 tons during the third calendar quarter of 2014.
 
The volume of shipments of iron ore pellets (and other iron ore products) by Northshore varies from quarter to quarter and year to year based on a number of factors, including the requested delivery schedules of customers, general economic conditions in the iron ore industry, and weather conditions on the Great Lakes. Further, the prices under the term contracts between Northshore, Cliffs, and certain of their customers (the Cliffs Pellet Agreements), to which Mesabi Trust is not a party, are subject to interim and final pricing adjustments, dependent in part on multiple price and inflation index factors that are not known until after the end of a contract year.  These multiple factors can result in significant variations in royalties received by Mesabi Trust (and in
 





 
turn the resulting funds available for distribution to Unit holders by Mesabi Trust) from quarter to quarter and from year to year. These variations, which can be positive or negative, cannot be predicted by the Trustees of Mesabi Trust. Royalty payments received in 2015 and prior years continue to reflect pricing estimates for shipments of iron ore products that were subject to negative pricing adjustments pursuant to the Cliffs Pellet Agreements.  Based on the above factors and as indicated by the Trusts historical distribution payments, the royalties received by the Trust, and the distributions paid to Unit holders, if any, in any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of royalties that will be received, or distributions that will be paid, if any, in any subsequent quarter or for a full year.
 
With respect to the remainder of calendar year 2015, Northshore has not advised Mesabi Trust of its expected 2015 shipments of iron ore products or what percentage of 2015 shipments will be from Mesabi Trust iron ore.  Cliffs indicated that the royalty payments being reported today are based on estimated iron ore pellet prices under the Cliffs Pellet Agreements, which are subject to change.  It is possible that future negative price adjustments could offset, or even eliminate, royalties or royalty income that would otherwise be payable to Mesabi Trust in any particular quarter, or at year end, thereby potentially reducing cash available for distribution to Mesabi Trusts Unit holders in future quarters.  In addition, Cliffs Pellet Agreements contain various pricing formulas and price adjustment provisions, the average sales prices received by Mesabi Trust may not match international iron ore pellet prices.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to iron ore pellet production, iron ore pricing and adjustments to pricing, shipments by Northshore in 2015, royalty (including bonus royalty) amounts, and other matters, which statements are intended to be made under the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Actual production, prices, price adjustments, and shipments of iron ore pellets, as well as actual royalty payments (including bonus royalties) could differ materially from current expectations due to inherent risks such as general and industry economic trends, uncertainties arising from war, terrorist events and other global events, higher or lower customer demand for steel and iron ore, decisions by mine operators regarding curtailments or idling production lines or entire plants, environmental compliance uncertainties, difficulties in obtaining and renewing necessary operating permits, higher imports of steel and iron ore substitutes, processing difficulties, consolidation and restructuring in the domestic steel market, indexing features in Cliffs Pellet Agreements resulting in adjustments to royalties payable to Mesabi Trust and other factors. Further, substantial portions of royalties earned by Mesabi Trust are based on estimated prices that are subject to interim and final adjustments, which can be positive or negative, and are dependent in part on multiple price and inflation index factors under agreements to which Mesabi Trust is not a party and that are not known until after the end of a contract year. Although the Mesabi Trustees believe that any such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially.  Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in the Trusts filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Mesabi Trust undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements that may be in this press release.

There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account.

If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
