                Industry Watch: Jack L. Farley And John O. Purswell, Jr.            




                Jack L. Farley 

Jack L. Farley, 80, of Siloam Springs, AR, died May 12, 2013, at his home.  Born December 30,1932, in Siloam Springs, he was the son of Jesse John Farley and Grace Daniels Farley.He attended John Brown University, Oklahoma State Tech, and Evangel College in Springfield, MO.  Jack served in the Army during the Korean Era.  In Tulsa, he worked in the oil and gas production industry as a buyer and international expediter for Crest Engineering, Inc., and Williams Engineering.  He was a member of the NOMADS and former board member of the Cleaning Equipment Manufacturing Association (now CETA).  He lived in Tulsa for 36 years and moved back to Siloam Springs in 1986 to join his brother Bob at Farley's, Inc. In Siloam Springs, he was a member of First United Methodist Church and the Siloam Springs Rotary Club.  Jack married Sue Kelly Tapp in 1989.

Survivors include his wife Sue of the home; one daughter, Dr. Becky Gwen Farley and husband David Nelson of Tucson, AZ; three step-sons, Mark Tapp and wife Lynn of Pearland, TX, Michael Tapp and wife Penny of Houston, TX, and Mitchell Tapp and wife Linda of Ingleside, TX; eight grandchildren; nine great grandchildren; three brothers, Verne Farley and wife Beverly of Twin Falls, ID, Bill Farley and wife Cyd of Owasso, OK, and Bob Farley and wife Ethelyn of Siloam Springs, AR; one sister, Iris Dill and husband Terry of The Woodlands, TX; and a number of nieces and nephews.

Memorial services were held Thursday, May 16,2013, at First United Methodist Church, Siloam Springs, with Dr. Randy Rowlan officiating.  In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the First United Methodist Church, 325 E. Twin Springs, Siloam Springs, AR 72761.

John O. Purswell, Jr.

John O'Brean Purswell went to be with his Lord Jesus Christ on Saturday, May 11,2013.  He was born on September 7, 1971, to John and Brenda Young Purswell in Baytown, TX.  On April 13,1991, John married Stephanie Pitrucha at Memorial Baptist Church in Baytown.  He worked in the family business since he was 10 years old, working in service, sales, and deliveries until he was promoted to Vice President, and was scheduled to take over and run the family business in the coming year.

In high school, John was a member of the "National Champion Parliamentary Procedure" team.  He graduated from Lee College with an Associate's Degree, then attended LeTourneau University where he received his Bachelor's Degree.  John was very active in community youth organizations and coached each of his children's teams numerous times in baseball, basketball, and soccer, currently serving as President of the Local Soccer Club.Instrumental in numerous committees at Memorial Baptist Church, John brought the first "Upward Basketball" program to Bay town, and then helped bring "indoor soccer" and served as its Director for Memorial Baptist.  John also taught numerous Sunday School classes over the years and served as Director for the Memorial Baptist "Children's Church."He also remained very active in his National Trade Association, other civic groups, and school organizations.

John was a "gentle giant" with a ready smile and a quick wit.  He was a fine son, an outstanding husband, and a dedicated father.  He touched so many lives and will be missed by many where he has left his footprints on countless hearts.John is survived by his wife, Stephanie Pitrucha Purswell; parents, John Sr.  And Brenda Purswell; children, Megan Elizabeth, Austin Reed, and Carson Reese Purswell; extended family sister, Josie Premutico, niece Claudia, nephew Julian, and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins.  Funeral services were held on Tuesday, May 14, 2013, at Memorial Baptist Church in Baytown with Rev. Randy Piatt officiating.

In lieu of flowers, support may be shown through a contribution to the Purswell College Fund Trust, Bank account at Community Resource Credit Union, Account # 54947.  Contact Nery Santibanez at ext.  1101.

Warning Signs 

by John R. Pursivell, CEO Alkletm Industries 

John Purswell Jr.  Left with his two sons for a soccer game on Saturday morning May 4,2013.  Praise the Lord that John had let his son drive that morning.  While they were still close to Baytown, John groaned a few times and slumped over without saying a word.  Austin, his oldest son, recognized that something was wrong and turned and immediately went as rapidly as possible to the nearest hospital.  He reached the hospital in about five minutes and rallied the emergency room personnel, and they began working on John even before he was taken from the truck.  They worked for more than 40 minutes to reestablish a rhythmic heart beat and finally succeeded, but the damage was already done.  John succumbed to the damage done in that 40 to 45 minutes to many of his organs the following Saturday, May 11,2013.

John was 41 years old with a wife and three children.The reason I write this is that I can only assume a couple of things that we were never able to discuss.  One is that I have learned that all heart attacks are not created equal.  Some people are blessed to survive an attack (as I was) with a few stints and go back to a reasonably normal life.  However, in the part of the heart that was affected with John Jr., his heart went into ventricular fibrillation.  According to the cardiologist, when that happens, the heart just stops pumping.The cardiologist told me you have a maximum of four to six minutes to restore circulation, or your chances of ever knowing who you are again are extremely remote.  Yes, there are exceptions and that is what we were all praying for, but sometimes that is not part of God's plan.

The lesson to be learned is don't ignore your body's warnings signs until it is convenient to have them checked out.  If you are having chest pains, go to the emergency room immediately.  You may not have a second chance, cr
