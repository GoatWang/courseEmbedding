What We Do


             Petro River Oil Corp. (OTCBB: PTRC) is an independent energy company focused on the exploration and development of conventional oil and gas assets.  Petro River’s business model is to enter highly prospective conventional plays with industry-leading partners. Our diversification across multiple projects, each with low initial capital expenditures and strong risk reward characteristics, reduces risk and provides exposure to a number of attractive risk adjusted opportunities.
           






Corporate Presentation


             Below is a link to Petro River’s corporate presentation outlining its strategy and portfolio.
           

Full Presentation

Investor James Altucher On Petro River Management









Our Business Model

Three Principal Elements

Acquisition and development of overlooked and undervalued assets. We have identified and acquired such assets in Osage County, Oklahoma, in the San Joaquin valley, California, and Larne Basin, Northern Ireland. Exploit and expand known-producing oil-focused fields and basins that have been neglected due to lack of capital, modern imaging and drilling advances.
Recovery limited to conventional drilling. The company does not engage in horizontal drilling, shale, tar sands or deepwater drilling. In doing so, we believe we can achieve breakeven at $30 per BBL
Leverage seismic imaging to maximize returns. Technical advances in imaging and modeling can lower risk and enhance productivity. The Company intends to utilize 3-D seismic and other technological advancements that benefit its exploratory and developmental drilling program.





Our Assets

Focused on Low-Cost Production





                    Osage County, OK                


Petro River is pursuing its core strategy in this well-known basin, drilling vertical wells in relatively shallow conventional legacy reservoirs using modern 3D seismic surveys. PTRC has acquired 106,000 acres in Osage County in an area that was the focus of a deeper horizontal play—that proved to be uneconomic—and has reprocessed 35 square miles of … Continued

                    Denmark                


Horizon has contractual rights to participate for a 50% interest with Ardent Oil Limited (‘Ardent’), an experienced UK-based oil and gas prospect generating company, in four recently awarded offshore licenses granted to Ardent in the 7th offshore licensing round in Denmark. The licenses are all located in unique geological settings and require modest work programs. … Continued

                    Grapevine Energy, LLC. California                


Grapevine Energy, LLC (‘Grapevine’) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Horizon. It was formed to acquire leasehold interests in Kern County, California and explore for and develop hydrocarbons thereon. Grapevine’s area of interest contains a significant hydrocarbon discovery (‘Discovery’) made in the fall of 2014 by a company of which the founder of Horizon was formerly … Continued

                    Kern County, California                


Petro River and Horizon collectively own a 41.25% working interest in oil and gas leases comprising approximately 7,000 acres, in the San Joaquin Basin in Kern County, California, covering the Kern County field redevelopment project. Horizon has a 27.5% working interest and Petro River a 13.75% working interest. The Kern County field was discovered in … Continued

                    Larne Basin, Northern Ireland                


Due to historical political and geological issues, which now have been resolved, the Larne Basin remains the only Carboniferous Basin in Europe essentially untested for hydrocarbons. Through long-standing industry contacts, Horizon Energy was offered the opportunity to participate on favorable terms in the exploration and development of the Larne Basin through the acquisition of working … Continued

Historic Basins with billions of barrels still in place

In Oklahoma, The Oklahoma Geologic Survey estimates that there were more than 84 billion barrels of original oil in place in Oklahoma from conventional, historically producing oil reservoirs.
In the San Joaquin Basin, California. A USGS study of the San Joaquin Basin estimated a mean of 6.5 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil.
In Larne Basin, Northern Ireland. The un-risked, potential recoverable resources for the entire Larne Basin are in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil.




OUR STRATEGY

Our strategy is to identify, acquire and develop conventional oil and gas assets with the following characteristics:


Low drilling and completion costs --under $10 per barrel of oil.



Partnerships with local operators with deep technical understanding and success in the region.



Utilize 3D seismic technology to identify low risk – high return drilling targets for development.

Horizon Energy Partners CEO Jonathan Rudney talks 3-D Seismic pic.twitter.com/1sFnT71FCu— Petro River Oil (@PetroRiverOil) June 6, 2017






Our Advantages

Our properties lie in historic basins, with considerable oil in place, in fields that haven’t been studied with the benefit of 3D seismic data, further compromised by lack of available capital.
Technical excellence. Petro works with one of the most active drillers and operators in the region and leverages that expertise in the interpretation of geological and operational opportunities






 


ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OVERLOOKED AND UNDERVALUED ASSETS

We have identified and acquired such assets in Osage County, Oklahoma, in the San Joaquin valley, California, and Larne Basin, Northern Ireland. Exploit and expand known-producing oil-focused fields and basins that have been neglected due to lack of capital, modern imaging and drilling advances.




 


RECOVERY LIMITED TO CONVENTIONAL DRILLING

The company does not engage in hydraulic fracking, horizontal wells, shale, tar sands or deepwater drilling. In doing so, we believe we can achieve breakeven at $30 per BBL.




 


LEVERAGE SEISMIC IMAGING TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS

Technical advances in imaging and modeling can lower risk and enhance productivity. The Company intends to utilize 3-D seismic and other technological advancements that benefit its exploratory and developmental drilling program.








The Future

Petro River Oil will continue to opportunistically increase our acreage in historically prolific fields, while maintaining low F&D costs to maximize profits even in a low priced commodity cycle.

Announces Vertical Drilling Program in Osage County & Provides Corporate UpdateMarketwiredApril 2, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareHOUSTON, TX--(Marketwired - Apr 2, 2015) - Petro River Oil Corp. (  OTCQB :  PTRC ) ("Petro River" or the "Company") is pleased to provide an update on its proposed drilling program on its core asset, the Pearsonia West Concession ("Pearsonia") in Osage County Oklahoma, as well as other recent corporate activities.Pearsonia comprises one of the largest contiguous oil and gas acreage positions in Oklahoma, at approximately 106,000 acres. Petro River acquired a controlling interest in the asset in May 2014 through an investment in Bandolier Energy LLC. Pearsonia had been previously exploited by horizontal drilling in Mississippian reservoirs and the future exploration and development strategy was to target similar reservoirs through horizontal drilling. In order to best develop Pearsonia, Petro River is actively pursuing a vertical development program built upon the 36 miles of high quality proprietary 3D seismic. Our technical team has identified a number of structural closures, ranging in size from 160 acres to 1000+ acres. These structures are suitable for and support a vertical development program that can be implemented in the near future and that we believe has economic merit in the current low crude oil price environment.Shane Matson, President of Bandolier Energy commented, "Osage County has long been known for having, along with 20 producing Paleozoic horizons, the best Mississippian reservoirs in the Mid-Continent. Our team has deep experience integrating advanced seismic interpretation techniques with existing well control to identify high grade vertical opportunities. This advantage, coupled with the immense knowledge base gained through the successful horizontal exploitation of conventional and unconventional Mississippian reservoirs in the county, gives confidence in our ability to successfully exploit the reserves we know are trapped in the subsurface."Pearsonia Vertical Drilling Program The relatively shallow nature of the reservoirs in the Pearsonia region along with few drilling hazards allow for low drilling and completion costs for vertical wells. Estimated costs are in the $275,000 - $300,000 range which is about 10% of the cost of a horizontal well. Operating costs for vertical wells are also much lower. Substantial investment has been made in infrastructure which complements and accelerates the time from well completion to oil production. Additionally, each well has the opportunity to encounter multiple reservoirs of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age, creating stacked potential for each wellbore. Recent conservative economic projections developed by the Company, calculated using low-case economic ultimate recoveries and current pricing parameters, indicate potential double-digit internal rates of return. These potential returns are enhanced if higher oil prices and larger reserves are achieved. Petro River is currently seeking development partners with the intention of commencing a pilot vertical well drilling program subject to regulatory approval.Experience in Mississippi Lime Vertical Drilling & Analogous Results Pearsonia is strategically located in a fairway of the most significant Mississippian fields in the county, the Greater Dog Creek-Pearsonia-Blackland-Foraker trend. Historically, surrounding fields have produced millions of barrels of oil from vertical Mississippian completions. The Burbank Oil Field, which has produced over 600 million barrels of oil to date, is located just adjacent to and down-dip of Pearsonia. Further, there are five major fields adjacent to or within the boundaries of Pearsonia. These five fields have an average of 60 vertical wells with cumulative oil production of 19.2 million barrels of oil, cumulative natural gas production of approximately 7.35 billion cubic feet, and average production of 71,100 barrels of oil per well. In addition, the Company's management and advisory board have substantial experience executing development programs in the region. Collectively, the management of Petro River, Bandolier, and the advisory team have drilled over 200 wells in the Mid-continent region and have 85 years' experience successfully drilling wells in the Mississippian and related structures.An Increased Focus on Technology Solutions Business Petro Spring  In an effort to take advantage of opportunities in the market, the Company has recently increased focus on Petro Spring LLC., its wholly owned technology focused subsidiary. Petro Spring recently acquired the patented Havelide System,™ a proprietary method using molten salt chemistry that converts natural gas to higher value liquid products, including naphtha, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrogen gas. Once commercial, the Havelide System™ would enable the conversion of gases to liquids with very favorable economics. Compared to Fischer-Tropsch, the current industry standard that has been employed for over 90 years, the Havelide System™ conversion is projected to be less than half the cost through a reduction in the capital, operating and processing costs. Petro River is in the process of fast-tracking the development of this technology.Read MoreExploration Opportunity in Larne Basin, Northern Ireland Petro River is currently evaluating an exploration project in Northern Ireland consisting of an opportunity to drill an exploratory well in Northern Ireland in the late third or early fourth quarter of 2015. The Larne Basin is one of the last remaining unexplored basins in the United Kingdom, with several nearby successful analogues. Structural traps and good reservoir rock have been identified through prior drilling and recent seismic acquisition, the primary risk being maturity and timing of source. If further drilling proves the existence of mature source rock, an entire basinal opportunity may be opened up with the potential for world-class reserve accumulations. Although no assurances can be given, in the event the Company pursues this opportunity and is able to acquire an interest, it is anticipated that the Company could have this working interest in the Larne Basin prior to the end of the current fiscal year.About Petro River Petro River Oil Corp.

Petro River Makes Oil Discovery in Kern County, California
BY GlobeNewswire— 6:00 AM ET 07/18/2017


New York, NY, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Petro River Oil Corp. (“Petro River” or the “Company”), an independent oil and gas exploration company, announced today a new oil field discovery in its Sunset Boulevard prospect in Kern County, California upon successfully drilling the Cattani-Rennie 47X-15 exploration well (“CR 47X”).
The CR 47X was drilled to a depth of approximately 8,500 feet and confirmed at least two commercially successful pay zones.   The discovery is currently being evaluated but initial results indicate significant reserve potential.  Following completion and production tests, the Company will announce development plans.  Several additional prospect wells are now being planned to be drilled in Kern County. “This is our 3rd discovery in the past 60 days confirming our application of 3-D seismic technology to find overlooked pools of oil in historically prolific fields,” said Stephen Brunner, President of Petro River.  Scot Cohen, Executive Chairman of Petro River added, “Based on our discoveries in Osage County, Oklahoma and Kern County, California, we are planning several development programs which has significantly less risk than our exploration wells.  After de-risking the three discoveries with successful exploration drilling, we can finally get into our development phase which can add significant daily production and cashflow for our Company by the end of this year.” Petro River owns a 19.25% interest in the Kern County field based on a 13.75% direct working interest and 5.5% indirect working interest through its 20% equity investment in Horizon Energy Partners, LLC. Historically, since its 1933 discovery, this field has produced over 100 million barrels of oil and equivalents from six distinct reservoirs. Our 3-D survey constitutes the first modern seismic data (including both 2-D and 3-D) acquired over this geologically complex field. ABOUT: PETRO RIVER OIL CORP (PTRC)  Petro River Oil Corp. (PTRC)  is an independent energy company with its core holdings in Northeast Oklahoma and Kern County, California. Petro River’s strategy is to apply modern technology, such as 3-D Seismic analysis to exploit hydrocarbon-prone resources in historically prolific plays and underexplored prospective basins to build reserves and to create value for the Company and its shareholders. Petro River owns a 20% equity interest in Horizon Energy Partners, LLC and its president, Stephen Brunner, is also a member of the Board of Managers of Horizon Energy Partners, LLC.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
