Dear Jane, Bill and Dan, My sisters and I join you in mourning the passing of your dear father, our Uncle Pat, as you now join us in the passing of our dear father, your Uncle Jim.  They were quite a pair, those two.  I will always remember them towering above us all as we scurried around them as kids, their long, steady strides the measure of our security, their broad grins the promise of our delight.  Together, they taught us all to appreciate nature, humor and the simple pleasure of sharing time with family.  I think we all agree that there is no better way to honor their memories than by keeping that tradition alive with each other. So, see you soon for some of that, eh? --With love to you and yours, from your cousin, Jerry

Dearest Janie, Billy, and Danny,
Your darling father, my Uncle Pat, will always hold a most special place in my heart....he taught me how to dive off the dock at Spread Eagle....he was always a joy to be around, and was like having another version of my own daddy around.  In my mind's eye, I see all 3 brothers now together, with their beautiful smiles.  I love you all and we will get together soon.  All my love, always.
Your cousin Julie

Dear, Janie, Bill & Danny,
What a lovely tribute to your dad, my uncle Pat.  I can hear his voice on the phone and his wonderful, distinctive laugh.  What great times we all had at Spread Eagle, especually in 1982 when your Dad made us all promise to be good to one another and keep in touch. And that we will. When my Daddy dies, I though of how wonderful it was that he, Pat and Jerry would now all be together with their Mom and Dad.
So much love to you all,
Your cousin Lisa

Dear Jane, Bill, and Dan
     Uncle Pat is in my memory and my heart.  He was such a dear brother to my dad (and mother, too).  I think of him whenever I smell a good pipe, go water skiing, hear "Danny Boy".  It was always so exciting when we were children to hear Pat's  distinctive voice on the phone because it meant we'd  soon be off to see our favorite cousins, Auntie, and Uncle.
     I send my best love and peace to you all,
Jean

Sorry to hear about your dad. We saw it on the internet. We always had such a nice visit with him when we first built our place at the lake. He had a wonderful smile. 
Our deepest sympathy to you and your families.
Mike and Sharon Evans

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Condolence & Memory Journal



Dear Jane, Bill and Dan, My sisters and I join you in mourning the passing of your dear father, our Uncle Pat, as you now join us in the passing of our dear father, your Uncle Jim.  They were quite a pair, those two.  I will always remember them towering above us all as we scurried around them as kids, their long, steady strides the measure of our security, their broad grins the promise of our delight.  Together, they taught us all to appreciate nature, humor and the simple pleasure of sharing time with family.  I think we all agree that there is no better way to honor their memories than by keeping that tradition alive with each other. So, see you soon for some of that, eh? --With love to you and yours, from your cousin, Jerry

Dearest Janie, Billy, and Danny,
Your darling father, my Uncle Pat, will always hold a most special place in my heart....he taught me how to dive off the dock at Spread Eagle....he was always a joy to be around, and was like having another version of my own daddy around.  In my mind's eye, I see all 3 brothers now together, with their beautiful smiles.  I love you all and we will get together soon.  All my love, always.
Your cousin Julie

Dear, Janie, Bill & Danny,
What a lovely tribute to your dad, my uncle Pat.  I can hear his voice on the phone and his wonderful, distinctive laugh.  What great times we all had at Spread Eagle, especually in 1982 when your Dad made us all promise to be good to one another and keep in touch. And that we will. When my Daddy dies, I though of how wonderful it was that he, Pat and Jerry would now all be together with their Mom and Dad.
So much love to you all,
Your cousin Lisa

Dear Jane, Bill, and Dan
     Uncle Pat is in my memory and my heart.  He was such a dear brother to my dad (and mother, too).  I think of him whenever I smell a good pipe, go water skiing, hear "Danny Boy".  It was always so exciting when we were children to hear Pat's  distinctive voice on the phone because it meant we'd  soon be off to see our favorite cousins, Auntie, and Uncle.
     I send my best love and peace to you all,
Jean

Sorry to hear about your dad. We saw it on the internet. We always had such a nice visit with him when we first built our place at the lake. He had a wonderful smile. 
Our deepest sympathy to you and your families.
