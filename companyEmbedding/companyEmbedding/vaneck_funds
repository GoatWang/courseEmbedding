History
Founded in 1955 by John C. van Eck, Van Eck Associates Corporation was among the first U.S. investment managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its tradition of responding to the needs of investors by offering innovative investment strategies in emerging markets equity and fixed income, natural resources and commodities, gold and precious metals, liquid alternatives, and other specialized, global asset classes.
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006 when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today we offer more than 50 ETFs that span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of our ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region or sector. VanEck is one of the largest ETP providers in the U.S. and worldwide.

History
Founded in 1955 by John C. van Eck, Van Eck Associates Corporation was among the first U.S. investment managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its tradition of responding to the needs of investors by offering innovative investment strategies in emerging markets equity and fixed income, natural resources and commodities, gold and precious metals, liquid alternatives, and other specialized, global asset classes.
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006 when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today we offer more than 50 ETFs that span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of our ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region or sector. VanEck is one of the largest ETP providers in the U.S. and worldwide.

VanEck Announces Changes to VanEck Vectors ETF Product Line






September 08, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck, one of the largest providers of exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) 
      in the U.S. and worldwide with more than $39 billion in assets under 
      management as of July 31, 2016, announced today that it plans to close 
      and liquidate two VanEck Vectors ETFs.
    

      On September 7, 2016, the Board of Trustees of VanEck Vectors ETF Trust 
      approved the liquidation and dissolution of the following funds (the 
      “Funds”):

      Shareholders of the Funds may sell their holdings on NYSE Arca Inc. 
      (“NYSE Arca”) until market close on September 28, 2016, and they may 
      incur typical transaction fees from their broker-dealer. The Funds’ 
      shares will no longer trade on NYSE Arca after market close on September 
      28, 2016, and the shares will subsequently be de-listed. Shareholders 
      who continue to hold shares of any of the Funds on the Funds’ 
      liquidation date, which is expected to be on or about October 18, 2016, 
      will receive a liquidating distribution of cash in the cash portion of 
      their brokerage accounts equal to the amount of the net asset value of 
      their shares. Proceeds from the liquidation are currently scheduled to 
      be sent to shareholders on or about October 18, 2016, although this may 
      occur prior to or later than this date. For tax purposes, shareholders 
      will generally recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the amount 
      received for their shares over their adjusted basis in such shares. The 
      Funds will stop accepting creation orders from Authorized Participants 
      on September 28, 2016.
    

      In addition, shareholders who hold shares of the Funds may receive a 
      final distribution of net income and capital gains earned by the Funds 
      and not previously distributed prior to liquidation.
    

      The final tax status of distributions made by the Funds, including the 
      liquidating distribution, will be provided to shareholders with the 
      year-end tax reporting for the Funds (including any portion which may be 
      treated as a return of capital for tax purposes, reducing a 
      shareholder’s basis in such shares).
    

      If you have any questions concerning this information or the VanEck 
      Vectors ETFs in general, please call 800.826.2333 between 9:00 a.m. and 
      5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
    

About VanEck


      VanEck’s mission is to offer intelligently designed investment 
      strategies that take advantage of targeted market opportunities. Founded 
      in 1955, the firm is a pioneer in global investing with a history of 
      placing clients’ interests first in all market environments. Today, 
      VanEck continues this tradition by offering innovative active and 
      passive investment portfolios in hard assets, emerging markets equity 
      and debt, precious metals, fixed income, and other alternative asset 
      classes. VanEck Vectors exchange-traded products are one of the largest 
      ETP families in the world, managing more than 70 funds that span a range 
      of sectors, asset classes, and geographies. As of July 31, 2016, VanEck 
      managed approximately $39.1 billion in assets, including mutual funds, 
      ETFs, and institutional accounts.
    

      Please call 800.826.2333 or visit our website for the most recent 
      month-end performance of VanEck Vectors ETFs. This information will be 
      available no later than seven business days after the most recent month 
      end.
    

      The “net asset value” (NAV) of an ETF is determined at the close of each 
      business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the ETF; 
      it is calculated by taking the total assets of an ETF subtracting total 
      liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The 
      NAV is not necessarily the same as an ETF's intraday trading value. 
      Investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV. Total returns 
      are based upon closing “market price” (price) of the ETF on the dates 
      listed.
    

      Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and 
      redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in 
      large, specified blocks of shares called “creation units” and otherwise 
      can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are 
      issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium 
      or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. You will incur 
      brokerage expenses when trading Fund shares in the secondary market.
    

Investors may call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com 
      for a free prospectus 
      and summary 
      prospectus. Investing involves risk, including 
      possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will decrease in value 
      as interest rates rise. An investor should consider the investment 
      objective, risks, and charges and expenses of VanEck Vectors ETFs 
      carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus 
      contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus and

About VanEck[edit]
Founded in 1955, VanEck is a U.S. investment management firm offering mutual funds, exchange-traded products (ETPs), variable insurance portfolios, separately managed accounts, and alternative investments. Its ETPs are marketed under the VanEck Vectors brand. The firm is headquartered in New York City, where its fund managers are located. In addition, it has a network of offices worldwide, including offices in Shanghai (China), Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain), Pfaeffikon (Switzerland), and Sydney (Australia).[3]
The firm was among the first U.S. money managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its pioneering tradition by offering innovative, actively managed investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals (including gold), fixed income, and other specialized, domestic and international asset classes.[citation needed]
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006, when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today VanEck Vectors offers more than 55 ETFs, which span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of these ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region/sector. VanEck Vectors is approximately the 9th largest ETF company as of the end of 2016.[4]
VanEck currently manages assets on behalf of more than 400 institutions, including endowments, foundations, hospitals, pensions, and private banks. Its traditional and alternative strategies are offered in both fund and separate account portfolios. In addition, VanEck offers the VanEck VIP Insurance Funds, a series of investment choices within the variable annuity contracts and variable life policies of widely known and highly regarded insurers.
History[edit]

1955 - John C. van Eck launched one of the first international equity funds that provided a vehicle for U.S. investors to share in the returns of post-war development in Europe and Japan.[5] Forecasting inflationary pressures in the U.S., van Eck established the nation’s first gold fund in 1968.
1980s - The company introduced one of the first global fixed income funds to capitalize on the depreciating dollar.
1993 - VanEck again offered one of the first mutual funds in what was once considered a cutting edge marketplace (Asia).
2006 - The firm launched its VanEck Vectors brand, under which it offers a series of exchange-traded products spanning many asset classes, including equities, fixed income (municipal and international bonds), and currency markets.
2011 - The firm commenced ETF self-indexing with the launch of Market Vectors Index Solutions (renamed MVIS in 2016).
2012 - VanEck expanded its liquid alternatives platform through the acquisition of a hedge fund beta business. VanEck also created a UCITS platform to offer a range of strategies to non-U.S. investors in 2012 and started operations of its VanEck Vectors Australia subsidiary.[6]

Flagship Funds[edit]
With an inception date of 1955, the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was the first gold equity mutual fund made available to U.S. investors and offering exposure to a distinct asset class that is often considered a hedge during times of economic and political uncertainty.[7]

VanEck Hard Assets Fund (GHAAX), launched in 1994, was the first "hard assets" equity fund offering investors exposure to securities of commodity-related companies.
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), launched in 2006, was the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. offering broad exposure to the gold mining equity market.[8]
VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (VNM), launched in 2009, was one of the first exchange-traded funds in the U.S. offering exposure to locally listed equities in Vietnam.

About VanEck[edit]
Founded in 1955, VanEck is a U.S. investment management firm offering mutual funds, exchange-traded products (ETPs), variable insurance portfolios, separately managed accounts, and alternative investments. Its ETPs are marketed under the VanEck Vectors brand. The firm is headquartered in New York City, where its fund managers are located. In addition, it has a network of offices worldwide, including offices in Shanghai (China), Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain), Pfaeffikon (Switzerland), and Sydney (Australia).[3]
The firm was among the first U.S. money managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its pioneering tradition by offering innovative, actively managed investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals (including gold), fixed income, and other specialized, domestic and international asset classes.[citation needed]
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006, when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today VanEck Vectors offers more than 55 ETFs, which span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of these ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region/sector. VanEck Vectors is approximately the 9th largest ETF company as of the end of 2016.[4]
VanEck currently manages assets on behalf of more than 400 institutions, including endowments, foundations, hospitals, pensions, and private banks. Its traditional and alternative strategies are offered in both fund and separate account portfolios. In addition, VanEck offers the VanEck VIP Insurance Funds, a series of investment choices within the variable annuity contracts and variable life policies of widely known and highly regarded insurers.
History[edit]

1955 - John C. van Eck launched one of the first international equity funds that provided a vehicle for U.S. investors to share in the returns of post-war development in Europe and Japan.[5] Forecasting inflationary pressures in the U.S., van Eck established the nation’s first gold fund in 1968.
1980s - The company introduced one of the first global fixed income funds to capitalize on the depreciating dollar.
1993 - VanEck again offered one of the first mutual funds in what was once considered a cutting edge marketplace (Asia).
2006 - The firm launched its VanEck Vectors brand, under which it offers a series of exchange-traded products spanning many asset classes, including equities, fixed income (municipal and international bonds), and currency markets.
2011 - The firm commenced ETF self-indexing with the launch of Market Vectors Index Solutions (renamed MVIS in 2016).
2012 - VanEck expanded its liquid alternatives platform through the acquisition of a hedge fund beta business. VanEck also created a UCITS platform to offer a range of strategies to non-U.S. investors in 2012 and started operations of its VanEck Vectors Australia subsidiary.[6]

Flagship Funds[edit]
With an inception date of 1955, the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was the first gold equity mutual fund made available to U.S. investors and offering exposure to a distinct asset class that is often considered a hedge during times of economic and political uncertainty.[7]

VanEck Hard Assets Fund (GHAAX), launched in 1994, was the first "hard assets" equity fund offering investors exposure to securities of commodity-related companies.
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), launched in 2006, was the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. offering broad exposure to the gold mining equity market.[8]
VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (VNM), launched in 2009, was one of the first exchange-traded funds in the U.S. offering exposure to locally listed equities in Vietnam.

Fund Summary and Key Points
VanEck has partnered with Ned Davis Research (NDR), a recognized leader in objective market and economic data and analysis with a long history of researching financial market cycles and using technical signals to supplement macroeconomic and fundamental research.  VanEck and NDR have developed the VanEck NDR Managed Allocation Fund, a tactical asset allocation fund that has the flexibility to freely allocate among securities and cash, helping investors with core asset allocation decisions, particularly related to timing.The VanEck NDR Managed Allocation Fund (the "Fund"), a new open-end mutual fund, seeks capital appreciation by allocating primarily to exchange-traded products (ETPs) that invest in domestic and foreign equities, and U.S. debt securities and cash and cash equivalents.The Fund uses NDR's model that combines over 130 macroeconomic, fundamental and technical indicators to overweight asset classes expected to outperform on a relative basis and underweight or exit those expected to underperform.The portfolio managers in VanEck's Portfolio and Risk Solutions group make allocation decisions using the NDR model. This group conducts its own asset allocation and risk modeling research that is used by many of VanEck’s investment strategies and also maintains continuous interaction with NDR to review the latest research.

Important Disclosure 
Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics. 
†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distribution. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge. See the 
                                            
    prospectus for more information.
1Other expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. Van Eck Associates Corporation (the "Adviser") has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.15% for Class A, 0.85% for Class I, and 0.90% for Class Y of the Fund's average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation. 
2The Fund's benchmark index (60% MSCI ACWI/40% BbgBarc US Agg) is a blended index consisting of 60% MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) and 40% Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. The MSCI ACWI captures large and mid cap representation across 23 Developed

All
indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not
reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees, or expenses that are
associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not
illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which
investments can be made. 
The views and opinions expressed
are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should
not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with
market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the
commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities.
Fund holdings will vary. 
You can lose money by investing
in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment
program rather than a complete program. All mutual funds are subject to market
risk, including possible loss of principal. Because the Fund is a
"fund-of-funds," an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks
of the exchange-traded products in which it invests, including but not limited
to, risks associated with smaller companies, foreign securities, emerging markets,
debt securities, commodities, and derivatives. The Fund will bear its share of
the fees and expenses of the exchange-traded products. Consequently, an
investment in the Fund entails more direct and indirect expenses than a direct
investment in an exchange-traded product. Because the Fund invests in
exchange-traded products, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply
to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an
exchange-traded product's shares may be higher or lower than the value of its
underlying assets, there may be a lack of liquidity in the shares of the
exchange-traded product, or trading may be halted by the exchange on which they
trade. Principal risks of investing in foreign securities include changes in
currency rates, foreign taxation and differences in auditing and other
financial standards. Debt securities may be subject to credit risk and interest
rate risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when
interest rates rise. Because the Adviser relies heavily on third party
quantitative models, the Fund is also subject to model and data risk. For a
description of these and other risk considerations, please refer to the Fund’s
prospectus, which should be read carefully before you invest.  
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

(“NYSE Arca”) until market close on September 28, 2016, and they may incur typical transaction fees from their broker-dealer. The Funds’ shares will no longer trade on NYSE Arca after market close on September 28, 2016, and the shares will subsequently be de-listed. Shareholders who continue to hold shares of any of the Funds on the Funds’ liquidation date, which is expected to be on or about October 18, 2016, will receive a liquidating distribution of cash in the cash portion of their brokerage accounts equal to the amount of the net asset value of their shares. Proceeds from the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about October 18, 2016, although this may occur prior to or later than this date. For tax purposes, shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the amount received for their shares over their adjusted basis in such shares. The Funds will stop accepting creation orders from Authorized Participants on September 28, 2016.In addition, shareholders who hold shares of the Funds may receive a final distribution of net income and capital gains earned by the Funds and not previously distributed prior to liquidation.The final tax status of distributions made by the Funds, including the liquidating distribution, will be provided to shareholders with the year-end tax reporting for the Funds (including any portion which may be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes, reducing a shareholder’s basis in such shares).If you have any questions concerning this information or the VanEck Vectors ETFs in general, please call 800.826.2333 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.About VanEckVanEck’s mission is to offer intelligently designed investment strategies that take advantage of targeted market opportunities.

This information will be available no later than seven business days after the most recent month end.The “net asset value” (NAV) of an ETF is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the ETF; it is calculated by taking the total assets of an ETF subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as an ETF's intraday trading value. Investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV. Total returns are based upon closing “market price” (price) of the ETF on the dates listed.Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called “creation units” and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. You will incur brokerage expenses when trading Fund shares in the secondary market.Investors may call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com for a free prospectus and summary prospectus. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, and charges and expenses of VanEck Vectors ETFs carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

 †NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
                          
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.38% for Class A, 2.20% for Class C, 0.95% for Class I, and 1.13% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.
2The S&P North American Natural Resources Sector (SPGINRTR) Index (the "Index") provides investors with a benchmark that represents U.S. traded securities that are classified under the GICS® energy and materials sector excluding the chemicals industry; and steel sub-industry. The MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers Index captures the global opportunity set of commodity producers in the energy, metal and agricultural sectors. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to risks associated with concentrating its investments in hard assets and the hard assets sector, including, precious metals and natural resources, and can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries, including international political and economic developments, inflation, and other factors. The Fund’s portfolio securities may experience substantial price fluctuations as a result of these factors, and may move independently of the trends of industrialized companies. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk, leverage risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and      
    summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

 †NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
                          
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.38% for Class A, 2.20% for Class C, 0.95% for Class I, and 1.13% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.
2The S&P North American Natural Resources Sector (SPGINRTR) Index (the "Index") provides investors with a benchmark that represents U.S. traded securities that are classified under the GICS® energy and materials sector excluding the chemicals industry; and steel sub-industry. The MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers Index captures the global opportunity set of commodity producers in the energy, metal and agricultural sectors. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to risks associated with concentrating its investments in hard assets and the hard assets sector, including, precious metals and natural resources, and can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries, including international political and economic developments, inflation, and other factors. The Fund’s portfolio securities may experience substantial price fluctuations as a result of these factors, and may move independently of the trends of industrialized companies. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk, leverage risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Please see the
