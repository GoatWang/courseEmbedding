Fast & Easy Guest Registration to Reduce Credit Card Fraud
























































Skip to content















Intellicheck's Guest ID™ makes check-in faster, easier and more accurate by instantly authenticating an individual’s ID, and automatically populating registration forms. 



 










Better customer service, faster check-in
Making sure every guest’s experience is the best it can be requires a commitment to customer service. That means making check-in as fast and easy as possible. That’s where Intellicheck Guest ID™ is a service standout.
Front desk personnel simply scan the guest’s identification using your existing property management solution—or with a smartphone or tablet—and the identification is instantly authenticated. So your personnel know if the ID is a fake. That reduces fraud.
Even better, once the ID is scanned, registration forms are automatically populated with the information from the scanned identification document. That makes registration faster and more accurate, and operations more efficient.
If you’re ready to reduce fraud while making your guests’ arrival as seamless as possible, you’re ready for Guest ID.
Why Guest ID?

Ensures faster, more accurate guest registration by integrating with your existing property management solution
Reduces check-in time by automatically populating guest registration forms
Increases awareness of fraud by instantly and accurately authenticating your guests’ IDs using either mobile devices or existing systems
Available as a subscription service or customized solution designed to meet your specific needs

Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. Featured on Fox Business News, Discussing 
      How It’s Handheld Defense ID® Systems Could Minimize Terrorist Threats 
      on Airlines






December 30, 2009 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



PORT TOWNSEND, Wa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. (NYSE Amex:IDN) was featured on Fox Business 
      News discussing how its Defense ID® access control product could have 
      prevented the terrorist attack aboard an airliner in Detroit.
    


      In the segment titled “Minimizing The Threat”, Cheryl Casone interviews 
      Steve Williams, Chief Operating Officer of Intellicheck Mobilisa, and 
      asks him how Defense ID could have prevented the attack on the Detroit 
      bound plane, since the attempted bomber had identification.
    

      Mr. Williams commented, “We would have scanned his ID and run the ID 
      against multiple databases. He was previously turned away in London and 
      as a result we could have used those databases, literally an unlimited 
      number of data sources to validate that person and make sure they 
      weren’t on a watch list, or a no fly list, or a wanted list for that 
      matter. Just like a TSA officer, you would scan a drivers license or a 
      passport and it would run a ‘bad guy’ check in about a second.”
    

      When asked if the company is getting more interest in its product, Mr. 
      Williams replied, “Absolutely. We have about 80 locations already in the 
      US, and we are including more data sources every day. We are obviously 
      getting more requests today, our stock is up 16%, and we speculate it is 
      due to the interest by TSA.”
    

      Ms. Casone asked Mr. Williams how quickly he could get a device to an 
      airport if they called up tomorrow. Mr. Williams replied, “By the time 
      they hang up the phone we can have a device to them. We have a national 
      distribution channel of major vendors throughout the country.”
    

      When Ms. Casone asked how this gentleman was able to travel from Lagos, 
      to Amsterdam, to Detroit with a bomb strapped to his body, Mr. Williams 
      answered, “You can add bomb detection machinery, but a bomb is a bomb, 
      and it takes a bomber to detonate it. Whether it be a bomb or anything 
      else, you have to screen individuals, that is the way you are going to 
      catch the bad guy.”

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Intellicheck Mobilisa Releases ID Scanning Product For Mexican Driver’s Licenses






Business Wire




Jan 23, 2014 7:30 AM EST













 




























































  Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. (NYSE MKT:IDN), a global leader in identity solutions and wireless security systems, has released a new software product, MexiScan™, for authenticating Mexican driver’s licenses and IDs.  MexiScan, a new technology platform being offered by Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc., allows banks, retailers and hotel chains to scan IDs issued from Mexico in order to automatically populate credit card and store loyalty club applications, check in guests, verify age and authenticate ID cards. MexiScan is similar to Intellicheck Mobilisa’s ID Check software which enables retailers to parse US and Canadian driver’s licenses. ID Check software sells for $99 per point-of-sale (POS) annually. MexiScan software sells for $59 per POS annually.  Nelson Ludlow, Ph.D., President and CEO of Intellicheck Mobilisa, said, “It just made sense to create a product to read Mexican IDs. Our national retail and hospitality customers want to ensure they are safely handling personal identity information for all of their customers, not just U.S. citizens.” According to Pew Research Hispanic Trends Project, Hispanics of Mexican origin are a significant portion of the U.S. population, accounting for 11 percent overall.  “Our impetus to develop MexiScan has come from our U.S. clients, particularly banks that want to be able to safely and easily set up accounts for Mexican citizens. But there is also a large addressable market for our software in Mexico.” There are over 118 million citizens in Mexico and a national GDP around $1.8 Trillion. “It is a major market and we are pleased to provide this same technology in use in the United States for use in Mexico,” Dr. Ludlow concluded.  About Intellicheck Mobilisa  Intellicheck Mobilisa is a leading technology company providing wireless technology and identity systems for various applications, including mobile and handheld access control and security systems for the government, military and commercial markets. Products include the Fugitive Finder system, an advanced ID card access control product currently protecting military bases and secure federal locations; ID Check, a patented technology that instantly reads, analyzes, and verifies encoded data in magnetic stripes and barcodes on government-issued IDs, designed to improve the Customer Experience for the financial, hospitality and retail sectors; barZapp™, an ID-checking mobile app that allows a user’s smartphone to check an ID card.

Intellicheck Announces the Release of Retail ID Mobile




New Product Go-Live Begins in Upscale Department Store Chains This 
      Month






May 11, 2016 08:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time



JERICHO, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intellicheck 
      Mobilisa, Inc. (NYSE MKT:IDN), a leader in threat identification, 
      identity authentication, verification and validation technology 
      solutions, today announced a new technology solution specifically 
      designed for mobile threat identification and fraud prevention in the 
      retail market. Retail ID Mobile™ provides retailers with a 
      mobile platform capability to prevent a variety of fraudulent retail 
      transactions, while delivering a warmer, more personal customer 
      experience that eliminates the need to integrate with the retailer’s 
      point-of-sale system.
    


      Retail ID Mobile installation is set to begin in two prestigious 
      department store chains this month. Once fully installed at their 
      locations, Retail ID Mobile has the potential to provide annual software 
      licensing revenues of $450,000 from the two prominent department store 
      chains. According to Intellicheck's CEO, Dr. William Roof, the new 
      product builds on the successes of Retail ID™, the industry 
      standard for threat identification pertaining to fraud in the retail 
      market. "We have been working closely with our clients to define and 
      develop new approaches to fraud prevention that also support a warmer, 
      more personal customer experience. Many retailers have begun deploying 
      their retail IT systems on mobile devices, such as tablets and 
      smartphones. We identified a clear path to supporting their new mobility 
      requirements, while, at the same time, supporting our clients’ desire to 
      avoid the cost and time associated with retail point-of-sale systems 
      integration. Our close collaboration with our clients resulted in this 
      new product. We expect growing adoption of Retail ID Mobile because 
      unlike other available products it provides instant and accurate 
      identification authentication and enhances the customer experience, 
      while avoiding the fiscal and temporal costs of point-of-sale system 
      integration,” said Dr. Roof.
    

      Typically, point-of-sale integration initiatives are often resource 
      intensive. They can lengthen the product installation schedule and move 
      revenue recognition out as much as nine months or more. Dr. Roof said 
      the Company recognized it could provide a better product than those 
      currently available, while at the same time advancing revenue 
      opportunities. "We seized on the opportunity to deliver another 
      industry-leading technology solution that would also move revenue 
      recognition in much closer, compress our sales cycle and expand our 
      opportunities significantly, by eliminating the need to integrate with 
      the point-of-sale system. To do this, we focused our Q1 2016 R&D on 
      product development that would generate revenues more quickly and 
      eliminate barriers for retailers and their customers,” Dr. Roof 
      explained.
