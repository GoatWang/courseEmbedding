View All SaleWhether you’re in need of a new tea kettle, want to buy a new cookware set for your home or apartment or want some specialty cookware to try out some new recipes, everything you need is at Williams-Sonoma, from tabletop items to kitchen electrics, to stock your kitchen so you can make every meal memorable. If you need quite a few items but are worried about breaking your budget, you can view all sale and clearance items so you’re able to find the pieces you need without going over budget.One of the most important things about a well-stocked kitchen is its cookware and serveware. Having professional-grade, quality equipment that’s easy to clean and maintain can make so much of a difference when it comes to your joy of cooking. If you’re in need of necessities and staples, there is a wealth of items such as fry pans and skillets, braisers, Dutch ovens and more on sale so you can stock – or restock – your kitchen. Choose from durable materials that cook food evenly, such as stainless-steel or copper cookware. There are also many different stove-top items, like saucepans and frying pans, with nonstick surfaces. Easy to clean by hand, many of these pieces are also dishwasher safe to make cleaning up after a long night of cooking a breeze.Having a few specialty items at your disposal can make for some interesting and inventive meals. If you’ve grown a bit tired of making the same handful of meals every week, branch out and try something different. For instance, a pressure cooker allows you to make everything from steamed vegetables to full entrées to rice, while a stove-top pizza oven allows you to fire homemade pizza right on your stove top. A waffle maker is great for making memorable breakfasts, while a miniature outdoor grill lets you have a barbecue party right in your backyard. Or you can take a small, portable grill with you to the beach or park. Other handy gadgets to have around include popcorn poppers, stand mixers and espresso makers, for that perfect cup of joe.Having the right tools at your disposal can also make your cooking adventures more seamless. Look for an array of different cooks’ tools on sale to simplify your process, or add some more cutlery to your kitchen ensemble. Having the right knife to prepare certain foods means a lot if you need to julienne or dice. It’s also a good idea to stock up on baker’s tools or bakeware, even during the summer months. Whether you’re whipping up an apple pie for an outdoor barbecue or are thinking ahead to Thanksgiving, any time is a good time to bake.When it comes to your tabletop and bar, look for bright and cheerful tablecloths, runners and linen napkins to make any occasion that much more special. When it comes to your bar, think about stocking up on needed tools before the outdoor barbecue season hits. Having shakers, jiggers, ice tongs and other equipment helps you play bartender at every gathering. The right glassware also helps your cocktail party or formal dinner look elegant and professional.Beyond equipment and accessories, there are also many special offers when it comes to food as well. Look for entire entrées to treat dad on Father’s Day, or opt for freezer-to-table pastries to serve at your next gathering. Sauces, glazes and marinades also easily turn your backyard barbecue from blah to fantastic, while desserts and candies are great treats all year long. For your home, freshen up your space with specialty soaps, lotions and candles, allowing a pleasant breeze to infuse your space both day and night.
