                                                    Be the first to commentInvestment AdviserBy Taha LokhandwalaMan GLG is to expand its UK long/short offering by launching a dedicated fund for value manager Jack Barrat targeting a 10 per cent annual return.Mr Barrat's strategy has been run as part of the asset manager's Dublin-domiciled Alpha Select fund - a UK long/short strategy - but the new product will focus primarily on the mid-cap market.Man GLG said it would also use the process behind its £653m Undervalued Assets fund - run by Mr Barrat and Henry Dixon - and the £158m UK Income strategy, managed by Mr Dixon.Mr Barrat said: "Our work on the UK market naturally identifies companies that we believed to be overvalued, further to the undervalued opportunities we look for. We were confident that we could effectively monetise this within an absolute return strategy, and have been successfully doing so within Man GLG Alpha Select Alternative."Our analysis shows that pockets of the UK market are expensive and the wide valuation dispersion in the mid-cap space is offering a compelling opportunity.”The fund - charges for which were not disclosed - will launch in June.Man GLG has also expanded its UK equity team with the hire of James Houlden from UBS. Mr Houlden will support the wider UK equity team working across all funds.Be the first to commentComments

Man GLG To Launch New Long/Short Absolute Return Fund
May 10 2017  |  9:35pm ET

Man Group’s Man GLG unit is prepping a new long/short mid-cap equity fund for launch in June.
Named the U.K. Absolute Return Fund, the new vehicle will be managed by value specialist Jack Barrat, according to a Citywire article, and will utilize the same investment process as the firm’s £650 million Undervalued Assets fund.  
The new fund is reportedly targeting an annual return of 10% and will concentrate on the mid-cap segment of the U.K. equity market. On the short side, it will target companies with overstretched valuations and hedge the portfolio from extreme market events such as electoral shocks, the article added. 
Management fees will be 90 basis points, with a 20% performance fee over a LIBOR hurdle, assuming regulatory approval for the structure. 
The fund’s genesis comes from the value team naturally finding overvalued companies in their search for undervalued ones, and needed a vehicle to monetize both within an absolute return approach. To this end, mid-cap stocks – which typically have a wide dispersion between under- and overvalued companies – are an attractive segment. 
Man GLG is the $28.8 billion discretionary investment management business of Man Group PLC, which traces its roots back to the 1783 founding of a sugar coop and brokerage company. The London-based company managed $80.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 through its five investment management businesses: Man AHL; Man Numeric; Man GLG; Man FRM and Man Global Private Markets. It is the largest listed hedge fund manager in the world.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

Man GLG launches global long/short value fund



						By Sam Shaw




				Added 14th February 2017
			




			Man GLG has launched a global long/short, market neutral, value-oriented fund for Niels Pecriaux. 
		
























Print









 The fund will seek to generate absolute returns through investing in opportunities across the consumer, industrials and materials sectors.
It will employ a bottom-up approach drawing on qualitative and quantitative analysis to provide the team with a deep and fundamental understanding of business operations.
The team will invest in stocks aiming for capital growth and employ risk management techniques to preserve capital while drawing on the shared expertise of Man GLG’s European equities desk.
Pecriaux joined the group in 2010 as part of the European long/short equities team, and has run a portfolio across the consumer and cyclical sectors for its internal multi-manager structure since October 2012.
He said: “Our aim is to utilise our disciplined investment process to cultivate a unique view of a company’s future potential, employing cutting-edge datasets and supported by a deep understanding of our universe of companies.

WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Fund

DYLS is a primarily long1
                                    strategy that is designed to add short2 exposure to hedge risk and reduce

                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
                                             
                                        
                                        Neither WisdomTree Investments, Inc. nor its affiliates, nor Foreside Fund Services, LLC., or its affiliates provide tax advice.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes.

•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
