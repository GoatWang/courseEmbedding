										About Intrepid
									










We are a young and growing global aircraft leasing company. With more  than $3 billion in assets.



Our strategy is to continue growing Intrepid as a leading lessor of mostly new and young passenger aircraft.
We are active in all three acquisition channels – new aircraft orders directly with Airbus and Boeing, sale and leaseback transactions with airlines, and portfolio acquisitions from other lessors.
  The current portfolio is on lease to 13 airlines in 11 countries. Our customers are mainly flag carriers and other strongly positioned airlines, which typically deploy our aircraft on key international routes.
  Intrepid has grown rapidly over the past four years and our focus has been on markets with the greatest growth in demand for air travel, especially in the Asia Pacific region. As we continue to grow and diversify, we anticipate our customer base will expand across the Americas and the Middle East as well.
  Our heritage is based on primarily acquiring wide-body aircraft, but over time we intend to broaden our fleet by adding more narrow-body aircraft to diversify our customer and asset base, as well as our global footprint.
  We designed our business model from a strong capital base provided by our shareholders, two large New York based private equity firms. Our aim is to generate stable and highly visible revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our team of professionals serves customers worldwide from our offices in Stamford, Dublin, and Singapore.













"The evolution of Intrepid reflects the strength and growth of the firm."
Olaf Sachau, Chief Executive Officer

General Information

Business:
We are a global leasing company that acquires and leases passenger aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world. Our strategy is to focus on young, modern, fuel-efficient twin-engine widebody aircraft with long-term leases to well-established airlines. We intend to invest primarily in these aircraft during the first one-third of their useful life while maximizing economic returns. We believe that a substantial opportunity exists to capitalize on the high level of demand for long-haul international air travel and airlines’ preference for larger gauge aircraft. We are the only aircraft lessor primarily focused on the twin-engine widebody passenger aircraft market, which we believe is a relatively less competitive lease market segment that has substantial latent demand.

We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of       common
shares in this offering will be approximately $    million (or $    million if
the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares),
assuming an initial public offering price of $    per share, which is the 
midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$    per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $    million, assuming the number of shares offered by
us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and 
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each increase (decrease) of 1.0 
million in the number of shares we are offering would increase (decrease) the 
net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by 
approximately $    million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price
stays the same.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to continue to purchase
aircraft and for general corporate purposes to support continued growth.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other
purposes. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering.


The leasing and remarketing of commercial passenger aircraft is highly 
competitive. We face competition from airlines, aircraft manufacturers, other
aircraft leasing companies, financial institutions, aircraft brokers, special
purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring, leasing and selling 
aircraft, and public and private partnerships, investors and funds, including
private equity firms and hedge funds. Competition for leasing transactions is
based on a number of factors including delivery dates, lease rates, lease terms,
aircraft condition and the availability in the marketplace of the types of 
aircraft to meet the needs of the airline customers. Our publicly listed 
competitors include AerCap Holdings N.V., Air Lease Corporation, Aircastle 
Limited, BOC Aviation Ltd., and FLY Leasing Limited.


Company Description
We are a global leasing company that acquires and leases primarily passenger
aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world. We lease primarily
young, modern, fuel-efficient twin-engine widebody passenger aircraft and larger
narrowbody passenger aircraft. We intend to expand our fleet


 mix by acquiring
aircraft that are currently in widespread use, are in-demand with airlines and
that we expect will have long useful lives. Our strategy is to enter into 
long-term leases (typically with initial terms ranging from ten to twelve years
for widebody passenger aircraft and six to ten years for larger narrowbody 
passenger aircraft) with well-established airlines, while seeking to maximize
long-term earnings growth and to generate attractive returns through the 
economic cycle. All of our leases are denominated in U.S. dollars and are
“triple-net” operating leases, which means that the lessee is required to pay
for all maintenance and overhaul, refurbishment, insurance, taxes and all other
aircraft operating expenses during the lease term.

Our owned and committed portfolio includes twin-engine widebody passenger
aircraft, such as the Airbus A330-300, Airbus A330-200, Boeing 777-300ER and
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, as well as the Airbus A321 narrowbody passenger
aircraft and the Boeing 747-8F freighter aircraft. As of December 31, 2016, we
owned 29 aircraft which had an aggregate book value of $2.9 billion. Our owned
aircraft as of December 31, 2016 have an average age of 3.0 years and our
aircraft on lease have an average remaining lease term of 8.5 years (the average
remaining lease term excludes six owned aircraft that are subject to fully 
executed leases with Turkish Airlines as of December 31, 2016), weighted by net
book value. Metrics noted as “weighted by net book value” are an average
resulting from the multiplication of each metric by the dollar book value of an
aircraft to reflect its relative importance. Historically, we relied 
predominantly on forward-order aircraft from original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”) to facilitate our growth. As of December 31, 2016, we had commitments 
to purchase four new aircraft directly from Boeing with an aggregate purchase
value of $1.4 billion at list price, subject to the satisfaction of customary
closing conditions. In addition, our ability to acquire these aircraft will also
depend on our ability to secure adequate financing. 

Our business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue,
earnings and cash flows. We target lessees that we believe will attract better
lease terms, including higher lease rates, longer lease durations, and higher
lease renewal rates which drive profitability and reduce residual value risk. We
fund the acquisition of our aircraft primarily with long-term secured credit
facilities that are either fixed rate or synthetically fixed using interest rate
swaps, with maturities that generally match those of our leases to mitigate our
interest rate and refinancing risk.

As of December 31, 2016, our owned aircraft have been placed on lease with a
diverse group of 12 airline customers in 10 different countries. Our customers
are well-established airlines or flag carriers, some of which are majority owned
by governments, and our aircraft are typically used on what we believe are key
international or long-haul routes for our customers. We will continue to 
diversify our portfolio by asset type, OEM, customer base and region. We will
continue to focus on markets with the greatest growth in demand for air travel,
especially in Asia Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

History[edit]
Intrepid Aviation was founded by Ron Anderson, a 20-year employee of FedEx Corp., in 1994 and was originally based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company started by buying used passenger aircraft and having them converted into cargo aircraft for leasing.[1] In 2007, Intrepid placed an order for 20 Airbus A330-200 freighter aircraft. During the financial crisis of 2007–08, Intrepid had to negotiate delaying deliveries by three years.[1]
The company subsequently reconstituted its management team and relocated its corporate headquarters to Stamford, CT. In 2014, the company filed for an IPO with a fundraising target of $150 million.[2][6] The company currently has equity commitments of up to $650 million from existing shareholders.,[7] and raised $215 and $120 million in bonds on 2014 and 2015, respectively. In August 2015, Olaf Sachau was appointed as its CEO and Doug Winter as its President.[1]
Fleet[edit]
The Intrepid Aviation fleet includes passenger aircraft such as the Airbus A330-300, Airbus A330-200, Airbus A321-200, Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. As of December 31, 2015, Intrepid had 29 aircraft in its fleet.[8]
The company has 13 airline customers in 11 different countries, including Alitalia, Air Namibia, Asiana Airlines, LOT Polish Airlines, China Airlines, Air France, Thai Airways, Sichuan Airlines, Philippine Airlines, EVA Air, Cebu Pacific, and Ethiopian Airlines. Turkish Airlines will become a new customer later in 2016.[2][6][9][10][11][12]

We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of       common
shares in this offering will be approximately $    million (or $    million if
the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares),
assuming an initial public offering price of $    per share, which is the 
midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$    per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $    million, assuming the number of shares offered by
us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and 
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each increase (decrease) of 1.0 
million in the number of shares we are offering would increase (decrease) the 
net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by 
approximately $    million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price
stays the same.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to continue to purchase
aircraft and for general corporate purposes to support continued growth.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other
purposes. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering.


The leasing and remarketing of commercial passenger aircraft is highly 
competitive. We face competition from airlines, aircraft manufacturers, other
aircraft leasing companies, financial institutions, aircraft brokers, special
purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring, leasing and selling 
aircraft, and public and private partnerships, investors and funds, including
private equity firms and hedge funds. Competition for leasing transactions is
based on a number of factors including delivery dates, lease rates, lease terms,
aircraft condition and the availability in the marketplace of the types of 
aircraft to meet the needs of the airline customers. Our publicly listed 
competitors include AerCap Holdings N.V., Air Lease Corporation, Aircastle 
Limited, BOC Aviation Ltd., and FLY Leasing Limited.


Company Description
We are a global leasing company that acquires and leases primarily passenger
aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world. We lease primarily
young, modern, fuel-efficient twin-engine widebody passenger aircraft and larger
narrowbody passenger aircraft. We intend to expand our fleet


 mix by acquiring
aircraft that are currently in widespread use, are in-demand with airlines and
that we expect will have long useful lives. Our strategy is to enter into 
long-term leases (typically with initial terms ranging from ten to twelve years
for widebody passenger aircraft and six to ten years for larger narrowbody 
passenger aircraft) with well-established airlines, while seeking to maximize
long-term earnings growth and to generate attractive returns through the 
economic cycle. All of our leases are denominated in U.S. dollars and are
“triple-net” operating leases, which means that the lessee is required to pay
for all maintenance and overhaul, refurbishment, insurance, taxes and all other
aircraft operating expenses during the lease term.

Our owned and committed portfolio includes twin-engine widebody passenger
aircraft, such as the Airbus A330-300, Airbus A330-200, Boeing 777-300ER and
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, as well as the Airbus A321 narrowbody passenger
aircraft and the Boeing 747-8F freighter aircraft. As of December 31, 2016, we
owned 29 aircraft which had an aggregate book value of $2.9 billion. Our owned
aircraft as of December 31, 2016 have an average age of 3.0 years and our
aircraft on lease have an average remaining lease term of 8.5 years (the average
remaining lease term excludes six owned aircraft that are subject to fully 
executed leases with Turkish Airlines as of December 31, 2016), weighted by net
book value. Metrics noted as “weighted by net book value” are an average
resulting from the multiplication of each metric by the dollar book value of an
aircraft to reflect its relative importance. Historically, we relied 
predominantly on forward-order aircraft from original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”) to facilitate our growth. As of December 31, 2016, we had commitments 
to purchase four new aircraft directly from Boeing with an aggregate purchase
value of $1.4 billion at list price, subject to the satisfaction of customary
closing conditions. In addition, our ability to acquire these aircraft will also
depend on our ability to secure adequate financing. 

Our business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue,
earnings and cash flows. We target lessees that we believe will attract better
lease terms, including higher lease rates, longer lease durations, and higher
lease renewal rates which drive profitability and reduce residual value risk. We
fund the acquisition of our aircraft primarily with long-term secured credit
facilities that are either fixed rate or synthetically fixed using interest rate
swaps, with maturities that generally match those of our leases to mitigate our
interest rate and refinancing risk.

As of December 31, 2016, our owned aircraft have been placed on lease with a
diverse group of 12 airline customers in 10 different countries. Our customers
are well-established airlines or flag carriers, some of which are majority owned
by governments, and our aircraft are typically used on what we believe are key
international or long-haul routes for our customers. We will continue to 
diversify our portfolio by asset type, OEM, customer base and region. We will
continue to focus on markets with the greatest growth in demand for air travel,
especially in Asia Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
