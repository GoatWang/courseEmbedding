Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.

Our Business







Carlyle’s Global Alternative Asset Management Platform
We are one of the world’s largest and most diversified alternative asset management firms. We manage 287 investment vehicles that invest across four segments, 11 core industries and six continents. Our global size, scale and brand enable us to access opportunities in virtually every market around the world.





 
















Carlyle's Business Segments







 

Corporate Private Equity
Corporate Private Equity
Carlyle’s Corporate Private Equity segment, established in 1990 with our first U.S. buyout fund, has Assets Under Management of $53 billion and more than 275 investment professionals. Our 30 Corporate Private Equity funds are organized by geography or industry and are advised by separate teams of professionals who live and work in the markets where they invest. We believe this diversity of funds allows us to deploy more targeted and specialized investment expertise and strategies and offers our fund investors the ability to better tailor their investment choices. Our Corporate Private Equity teams have two primary areas of focus:
Buyout Funds. Our buyout teams advise a diverse group of 20 funds that focus either on a particular geography (Asia, Europe, Japan, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South America, Sub-Saharan Africa or the United States), or a particular industry (e.g., financial services).
Growth Capital Funds. Our 10 growth capital funds are advised by three regionally-focused teams in Asia, Europe and the United States, with each team focused on middle-market and growth companies consistent with specific regional investment considerations. As of March 31, 2017, our growth capital funds had, in the aggregate, more than $6 billion in AUM.





 

Real Assets
Real Assets
Carlyle’s $36 billion Real Assets segment, established in 1997 with our first U.S. real estate fund, has 139 investment professionals managing 19 carry funds and 8 NGP management fee funds and carry funds focused on real estate, infrastructure, energy and power. Our 10 real estate funds pursue investment opportunities in Asia, Europe and the United States, while our energy and power funds focus on buyouts, growth capital investments and strategic joint ventures in the midstream, upstream, oilfield services and power generation sectors.







 

Global Market Strategies
Global Market Strategies 
Carlyle’s Global Market Strategies segment, established in 1999 with our first high yield fund, has a group of 57 funds that pursue investment opportunities across various types of credit, equities and alternative instruments, and (with regards to certain macroeconomic strategies) currencies, commodities and interest rate products and their derivatives. These funds, with AUM of $29 billion and more than 100 investment professionals, include:
Carry Funds. We have six carry funds in three different strategies: distressed and corporate opportunities (including liquid trading portfolios and control investments); corporate mezzanine (targeting middle market companies); and energy mezzanine opportunities (targeting debt investments in energy and power projects and companies).
Structured Credit Funds. Our 47 structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through structured vehicles and other investment products.





 

Investment Solutions
Investment Solutions
Investment Solutions helps clients meet their objectives through tailored portfolio construction and implementation. The Investment Solutions platform gives investors access to the large and complex universe of alternative investment strategies—private equity and real estate—on a global basis.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Carlyle Group L.P. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. Pursuant to a reorganization into a holding partnership structure, the Partnership became a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively," Carlyle Holdings") that the Partnership acquired using proceeds from the Partnership's initial public offering on May 8, 2012. Beginning on May 8, 2012, through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership. On May 2, 2012, our senior Carlyle professionals, the California Public Employees' Retirement System ("CalPERS"), and entities affiliated with Mubadala Development Company, the Abu-Dhabi based strategic development and investment company ("Mubadala") contributed all of their interests in the Parent Entities, and our senior Carlyle professionals and other individuals engaged in our business contributed a portion of the equity interests they owned in the general partners of our existing carry funds, to Carlyle Holdings in exchange for an aggregate of 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units. Carlyle Holdings did not conduct any activity prior to May 2, 2012. As the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements. The historical combined and consolidated financial statements of TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman, L.P., TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P., as well as their majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Carlyle Group"), reflect the predecessor financial statements of the Partnership, and are based on the historical ownership interests of the senior Carlyle professionals, CalPERS, and Mubadala in Carlyle Group. The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and, for periods prior to May 8, 2012, the financial condition and results of operations of Carlyle Group, the predecessor of the Partnership. Such analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Partnership's final prospectus dated May 2, 2012, included in the Partnership's Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (SEC File No. 333-176685). For ease of reference, we refer to the historical financial results of Carlyle Group as being "our" historical financial results. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we", "us", "our", and "the Partnership" are intended to mean the business and operations of the Partnership since May 8, 2012. When used in the historical context (i.e., prior to May 8, 2012), these terms are intended to mean the business and operations of Carlyle Group. Overview We conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Global Market Strategies, Real Assets and Investment Solutions (formerly referred to as Solutions).   Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 22 buyout and 9 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2014, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $65 billion in AUM and approximately $40 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 69 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt, as well as credit, emerging markets and commodities-focused hedge funds and a mutual fund. As of December 31, 2014, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $37 billion in AUM and approximately $34 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our nine U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our five Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes seven NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2014, our Real Assets segment had approximately $42 billion in AUM and approximately $28 billion in Fee-earning AUM.   Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities across 101 fund of funds vehicles. On July 1, 2011, we acquired a 60% interest in AlpInvest; on August 1, 2013 we acquired the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest. On November 1, 2013, we acquired Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management, LLC ("Metropolitan"), one of the largest managers of indirect investments in global real estate, which manages 26 fund of funds vehicles. Additionally, on February 3, 2014, we acquired Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation ("DGAM"), a global manager of fund of hedge funds vehicles, which manages 15 fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2014, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $51 billion in AUM and approximately $33 billion billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes. Trends Affecting our Business  We believe that on an annual basis, our diversified, multi-product global platform, which invests across numerous industries, asset classes and geographies generally enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund, investment or vintage. However, our results of operations, particularly our quarterly results, are affected by a variety of factors including global economic, market and financial conditions, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our carry funds, but periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth. For our hedge funds, opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies, certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility. These strategies include, but are not limited to, low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets, differences in market prices versus fundamental value and opportunities to profit from trading inefficiencies.  During 2014, the general economic climate started the year weaker, but by the second half of the year, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly 4% at an annualized rate. This acceleration in growth helped to offset the 2.1% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and bring GDP growth for the year to roughly 2.5%. Economic strength in the second half of the year contributed to an 11% increase in the S&P 500 index for the year. Stock markets outside of the U.S. were generally weaker in 2014, with the EuroStoxx index up by 3%, the MSCI ex-U.S. index down by 5.7% and the MSCI Emerging index down by 3.5%. The U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all other currencies in 2014, with gains of 14% versus the Japanese yen and the Euro and 2% versus the Chinese yuan renminbi. On a trade-weighted basis, the U.S. dollar rose by 9% for 2014. The increase in the value of the U.S. dollar likely will depress the foreign earnings of U.S. businesses, which could cause asset prices to decline or valuation ratios to increase further. While this may pressure the U.S. dollar values of our assets and portfolio outside the United States, we also expect it to create opportunities for our funds to invest in assets at more reasonable prices than have been available over the past several years.  In October 2014, the Federal Reserve ended its large scale asset purchase program and has signaled its intention to raise interest rates during 2015, depending on the results of incoming economic data during the year. Despite the expected increase in policy rates, market-based interest rates generally declined in 2014, with the 10-year yield falling from 3% at the end of 2013 to just 1.8% in early 2015. Yields on 10-year German and Japanese government debt fell to 0.48% and 0.27%, respectively, by January 2015. The decline in interest rates has been partially due to increased monetary accommodation in Japan and the expectation that the European Central Bank will launch an asset purchase program in the first quarter of 2015.  Some of the considerations informing our strategic decisions include:   Our ability to grow our fee-earning AUM. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised more than $24 billion of new capital commitments across our fund platform. Although the time required to raise a fund remains lengthened relative to historical years prior to the recession and the environment is competitive, our fundraising levels exceeded expectations in 2014 during which several of our larger funds were in the market. If our fundraising levels decline, this decline also will impact our fee-earning AUM. Our fee-earning AUM declined from $140 billion in 2013 to $136 billion in 2014, primarily due to large distributions from our funds stemming from significant exit activity. During 2015, we expect that much of our fundraising will come from mid-size funds and we will continue to sell remaining investments in many of the older, larger buyout funds, which may make it difficult to grow fee-earning AUM. In our open-ended funds, to the extent we face significant investor redemptions that are not replaced with subscriptions, our fee-earning AUM would be adversely impacted. Effective January 1, 2015, we had $2.2 billion net redemptions in our GMS hedge fund operations. Furthermore, from time to time, we may raise funds or managed accounts where we take fees on invested capital rather than on committed capital so we will not earn any fees from such commitments until we make an investment. As of December 31, 2014, we also had $9.4 billion of newly raised capital for which we have not yet commenced charging management fees. To the extent we fail to grow our fee-earning AUM, our management fee revenues also will be adversely impacted.   Our ability to offer and market differentiated products that engage new fund investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation. We continually seek to create avenues to meet our investors' evolving needs and broaden the appeal of our investment products by offering an expansive range of investment funds, developing new products and creating managed accounts and other investment vehicles tailored to our investors' goals. One area of recent attention has been the expansion of access to our products for a new base of individual fund investors, including through the launch of a mutual fund. We utilize both external strategies, including the use of feeder funds and other registered investment products, and our internal team of LP relations professionals to reach out to and expand our investor base. We have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to maintain our existing relationships, further develop external avenues to reach investors and support our LP relations personnel, which could increase our fundraising costs.   Our successful deployment of capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to deploy successfully the capital that our investors have committed to our investment funds. Greater competition, high valuations, cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Because we maintain a disciplined investment approach and analyze each carry fund transaction based on our ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we will not deploy our capital until we have sourced a suitable investment opportunity at an attractive price. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. During 2014, we invested approximately $10 billion in new and existing investments in our carry funds. Over the past five years, we have invested an average of more than $9 billion a year in new and existing investments in our carry funds. As of December 31, 2014, we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of $41 billion.   Our ability to generate strong absolute and risk adjusted returns. The strength of our investment performance affects investors' willingness to commit capital to our funds. The capital we are able to attract is one of the main drivers of the growth of our AUM and the management fees we earn. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized proceeds of approximately $20 billion for our carry fund investors. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. The valuation of our carry fund portfolio increased 15% overall during 2014 with a 23% increase in our Corporate Private Equity segment, a 20% increase in our Global Market Strategies segment and a 2% decline in our Real Assets segment. The decline in Real Assets was primarily driven by depreciation in funds in our energy platform in late 2014, but was partially mitigated by the lower economics of our interests in the performance fees from our Legacy Energy funds as opposed to the enhanced economics we hold in funds in our broadened energy and natural resources platform. We believe that this broadened platform will provide significant opportunities for future returns on our investment as we seek to deploy significant capital into the sector at current attractive values. Given increased competition for investments, and the effect, particularly in Europe and Asia, of the rising dollar against foreign currencies, the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates, but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation.  Recent Transactions  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2, Consolidation (Topic 820):  Key Financial Measures  Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VI, L.P. ("CP VI"), our sixth U.S. buyout fund with approximately $12.0 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2014, were approximately 14% of total management fees recognized . . .
