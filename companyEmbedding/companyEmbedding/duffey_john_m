Petition ClosedPetitioning President and Chief Executive Officer of Six Flags John M. DuffeyDecision makersJohn M. DuffeyPresident and Chief Executive Officer of Six FlagsRemove All Animals From Six Flags ParksJane Smith Menlo Park, CAJane SmithMenlo Park, CA1,411SupportersSix Flags, first of all, thank you for all the roller coaster goodness you have brought to the world.  It actually pains me to have to petition you but so it goes...  First, some not so happy facts:

In the wild, Asian elephants travel in family herds up to 30 miles a day. Six Flags has them marching in circles with kicking toddlers on their backs.
In the wild, Bottlenose dolphins swim in pods, exploring the ocean at over 20 mph. Six Flags has them stuck in tanks, doing stupid tricks to Katy Perry.  
In the wild, Siberian tigers travel miles to find prey. Six Flags parades them around wire enclosures, surrounded by screaming crowds.

None of this is right and while there are still people out there who will pay to see it, there are a lot of us who are sickened by it.  
Mr. Duffey (CEO of Six Flags), I read your company’s annual report (okay truthfully, I only skimmed it- it was really dull) but the part that jumped out at me was that Six Flags is concerned about the “changing preferences of the broad consumer market.”  Well sir, here is your notice of a changing preference. When I go to Six Flags, I don’t want to see animals in sad conditions. I want to ride Medusa until my head falls off.  
It is time for Six Flags to do the right thing and start sending its animals to sanctuaries. They have worked long enough and hard enough for you. Other companies have started their own processes (Exhibit A: SeaWorld; Exhibit B: Ringling Bros) and it's time for Six Flags to get ahead of the bad press that’s growing stronger every single day.  
You don't need animals. Focus instead on what you do best- building really really cool roller coasters.  Get rid of the elephants, dolphins, tigers and other animals (alright you can keep these ones) and build us one of these. Make the magic happen.
For all the folks reading this petition, thank you. This is your opportunity to tell Six Flags that what they're doing is wrong. Please take it with me. This petition was delivered to:President and Chief Executive Officer of Six FlagsJohn M.
