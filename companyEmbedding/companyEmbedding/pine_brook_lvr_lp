Our Story Home / Our Story 






We are in the business of helping management teams build their businesses.   We generate value by creating cash flows, not buying them.
In 2006 our founding partners created Pine Brook with the vision of providing management teams with capital they need to build their businesses, leveraging our expertise in financial services and energy, and offering investors an opportunity to achieve attractive returns.
We employ an investment strategy in which the primary risk is the execution of the business plan. This approach does not involve the technology, product or market risks characteristic of other venture capital strategies. Our strategy, source of returns and risk profile differ from those of typical leveraged buyout funds. Since inception, Pine Brook has consistently applied this strategy to more than 40 investments, and our senior team has been employing it successfully for more than 30 years. To date, Pine Brook, together with its limited partner co-investors, has invested and committed to invest in excess of $6.0 billion in our portfolio companies.

Sector Focus | Pine Brook Partners













































 















Menu










Sector Focus Home / Sector Focus 






We focus on investment opportunities in two large, complex and capital-intensive industries: Financial Services and Energy.
Our senior team has more than 30 years of experience building businesses in these industries.  We feel the financial services and energy sectors will continue to generate attractive investment opportunities, not only because of their importance to the overall economy, but also due to certain shared characteristics: both sectors are large and diverse; both have well established business models and both need to attract capital on a regular basis.  Since the sectors are driven by different economic and market factors, there is an opportunity to build a diversified portfolio of investments across these sectors and their many sub-sectors.
