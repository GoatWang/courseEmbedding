Before you
      continue and read the rest of this webpage, please allow me to explain why
      I'm doing this for free now.
My name
      is Patric Chan and I've taught tens of thousands of students worldwide. As
      much as I want to help you today, I hope you can understand that I'm doing
      this for the benefit of myself too.
After
      more than a decade of being in this business, I've realized that the REAL
      reason why someone achieves success or fail is not strictly based on the
      methods that they have learned - it's based on that person's mindset for
      success, their drive if you like. So I've wrote the book, WakeUp
      Millionaire to teach this, and I'm blessed knowing that it has achieved #1
      best-selling book in Amazon.com's "self help" category for Kindle in the
      past.
After
      I've trained you for free, I hope you'll buy a copy of it as well because
      I think it can help you to completely "re-wire" your mindset. But of
      course, if you feel that you've already conditioned your mindset for real
      success, then it's totally up to you if you don't want to read it. I would
      still be happy to help you start an internet business...

Research Interests

Professor Nagy’s research is characterized by the development and application of process systems engineering approaches and tools for engineered product design and optimal process operation, with applications in pharmaceutical, fine chemical, biotechnology, food and agrochemical industries. Our research combines modeling, optimization and advanced control approaches with experimental investigations using modern measurement techniques, with the generic aim to develop theoretically founded, practical methodologies for complex processes with quantifiable system performance improvements that can be supported in an industrial environment.

Crystallization Systems Engineering (CrySys)

The recent development in my group in the combination of multidimensional population balance modeling approaches and practical robust control techniques for better crystal engineering, enables the design and optimal production of particulate products with tailored properties and significantly reduced variability in quality. We develop novel control approaches that allow the control of size and shape distribution, polymorphic form and purity of crystals. These techniques are based on using complex mathematical models to predict the final product quality and perform optimization of the operating conditions so that the best product quality, such as highest purity and therapeutic efficiency, can be achieved in minimum time and cost. In addition to the model-based approaches, model-free control techniques for a variety of continuous and batch crystallization processes are also developed and evaluated in our Crystallization Systems Engineering laboratory. These are based on the direct use of a variety of process analytical technologies (PAT) and provide rapid design and scale-up approaches for crystallization systems. These techniques are investigated across broad scales, from microfluidic and droplet crystallization systems to large scale industrial processes.  

Control for intelligent manufacturing systems of particulates

We develop model-based simultaneous design and control techniques for integrated process systems that consider the entire sequence of unit operation for particulate production, and aim to lead to intensified, energy efficient processes. The control relevant investigation of the batch to continuous paradigm shift in manufacturing of solid products is also in the focus of our research. 

Process Analytical Technologies and Composite Sensor Arrays

Within this research, combined measurement techniques are developed to achieve robust control approaches for the simultaneous control of several product properties using combined model-based and statistical modeling techniques. These approaches are experimentally investigated currently for batch and continuous crystallization systems, using our intelligent decision support and control software, the Crystallization Process Informatics System (CryPRINS).
Some of these research themes are developed in cooperation with the University of Loughborough and the Innovative Manufacturing Research Center in Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallization from the UK.

Gábor Zoltán Nagy - Heemskerk, Hollandia, Sales and Marketing, Product Manager, Product Designer | about.meGábor Zoltán NagySmall Business Owner, Designer, and Father in Heemskerk, HollandiaView my portfolioA new year, a new country, and I hope a lot of new opportunities...The Illango story is continue soon!The content of the previous part:Black and white toys for babiesOur toys are mainly designed for the tiny ones. We design and produce them with manufactory methods one by one. We obtain our materials from local merchants and produce them here in Miskolc as well, so they are absolutely local products – this, we express everywhere. The toys are constantly being improved, focusing on uniqueness and functionality.According to our own experience and considering the results of science, we wish to facilitate the infants’ effective improvement. Our babies senses do not function with full efficiency in the first few months. In the beginning they only recognize blurry spots and sharp contrasts, as for seeing especially.The strong contrast of colours are the best for newborns because they can perceive the bold, high-contrast color schemes and graphics the earliest. These high-contrast colours truly captivate the babies, keep their attention vigilant and are an excellent help in developing their visual skills, and even encourage them to exercise, too. Visual stimulation is essential for the proper development of the vision in the first six months –meaning they learn to see--, but black and white games also improve the ability to concentrate and increase physical activity.Our toys made of various textiles are ideal for this purpose, our design has been evolved in this spirit. In addition, we specifically use typical boy and the girl's motives and nice color scheme when designing our accessorizes.The range of our products: interactive ball and cube, nap cloths, labelled cloths, baby books, rag dolls, butterfly rattle, children's rugs.They are collectively made and sold under the Illangó B&W toys brand name.We have some more ideas, we have different products in our heads, as an example, we would like to prepare toys for children with special educational needs. The detailed developing of these are in progress, too.Accessorizes or layette: small diaper bags, blankets, wall hangings, toy storage.These products are made and sold under the Illangó Accessories brand name.Our goals, our mission:Our goal is to add new tools into the hands of conscious parents.#enterpreneurship#design#fabrics#babygifts#toysWorkSales and Marketing

Legit Online Jobs - Special Offer












Legit Online Jobs







Special Alert: Now Available In Your Area!

Hi, my name is Ross Williams. Let me share a personal story with you. Back in 2007, I held an excellent position at a large IT company with a nice monthly salary. By 2008, the great recession hit. The company ran into financial problems and was forced to lay off over 50% of its staff. Unfortunately for me, I was included.
So there I was stranded, unemployed, with all the bills to pay and a family to support. Where I lived, such jobs weren't easy to come by.  So I decided to do a little research. I spent many sleepless nights on the web just searching for something to do, anything that could help support me and my family. I just wanted a way to make money, and not lose it, as I soon found to be the case with numerous internet scams.
Just like you, I often stumbled upon all types of web sites offering me some money matrix scheme, promising me all the money in the world. Yeah, right! From stuffing envelopes, Multi Level Marketing, High Yield Investment Programs, to selling all types of useless products. You name it, I've been there, done that. Finally, I came across something that worked... 


Online advertising has skyrocketed over the past few years. In 2015, companies spent close to $50 billion advertising online. That figure is expected to increase substantially in 2016. What does this mean for you? A lot more money could be going into your bank account this year. That's IF you take advantage of this secret system.
Companies worldwide are desperately searching for people just like you to type up their ads and post them online, and they'll pay you nicely in return. It's a win-win situation. They get more customers, you get paid. It's as simple as that. These companies have cash, LOTS of it and they're eager to share it with you. All types of individuals around the world are using this system to make more money than they ever could working in a boring, dead-end job. You can work part-time or full-time, it's all up to you.
All you need to get started is a computer with internet access. You'll be posting short text ads for companies and submitting them into various online forms. 
					No prior skills or work experience required, just basic 
					computer skills!








You submit the ads on your own schedule, day or night, and you do as many as you want with absolutely no restrictions. There will always be work for you to do no matter where you live.
This is a successful work at home program with unlimited potential. We'll show you 
					EXACTLY what you need to do to make money posting ads for companies online. It runs virtually on autopilot. Once your ads are submitted, they can be making money for you over and over. In other words, you don't have to be sitting in front of your computer all day just to make money. You can go play golf with your friends or go shopping at the mall with your family. It's totally up to you. That's the beauty of this system.
Members worldwide are accepted and
					you can start immediately. You will be provided with everything you  need to get started; including some sample info that you can just copy and paste into the forms, along  with our Complete Step-by-Step System.



Here's a screenshot from one of my accounts to prove this 
					system works. I make over $9,000 per 
					month! Now everyone won't start out making this kind of cash. This is a legitimate way to make a good income using your computer and the internet. Don't expect to make $1,000 per day. This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. However, if you follow our system correctly, you can earn a good income every month.
You can be paid weekly in all kinds of ways including check by mail, direct deposit, wire transfer and even directly to your Paypal account. These companies are reliable. You get paid on time, every single time. No worries about late paychecks. You can also login at any time during the day or night to check your stats and keep track of how much you have made in real-time.


There is a large demand for new affiliates, so the time to get in is NOW! We already have thousands of members around the world using our system, posting ads for companies and generating a great income doing it. Please keep in mind, this opportunity is for serious individuals who are willing to put in the effort. If you are a committed individual and think you can put in an hour or two per day submitting these ads, we want you on board!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
