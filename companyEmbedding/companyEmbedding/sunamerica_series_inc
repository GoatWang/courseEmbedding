Initiative aligns retail mutual fund family more closely with AIG






January 11, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) today announced the 
      rebranding of its retail mutual fund family to AIG Funds from SunAmerica 
      Mutual Funds, effective February 28, 2017.
    


      By rebranding its retail mutual fund family, AIG is able to provide 
      financial professionals and consumers diversified investment and income 
      products under a single brand.
    

      “We are committed to creating a leaner, more profitable and focused 
      insurer,” said Kevin Hogan, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of AIG’s Consumer Insurance. “By aligning the SunAmerica brand 
      more closely with AIG, we are able to leverage the strength and scale to 
      build greater awareness and visibility among our core audience of 
      financial professionals and consumers.”
    

      The name and logo under which the retail mutual funds are marketed is 
      being transitioned to the AIG brand. Each fund series, or registrant, 
      will retain “SunAmerica” in its name. There will be no change to the 
      retail mutual funds’ adviser (SunAmerica Asset Management, LLC) or to 
      the funds’ investment goals or strategies, portfolio managers, ticker 
      symbols or CUSIPs in connection with the transition. In addition to the 
      product rebranding, a new website will be available on February 28, 2017 
      at www.aig.com/funds.

Mutual funds are subject to risk including market risk as well as 
      additional risks, which vary depending on the type of fund. The 
      investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so 
      that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be higher or lower than 
      the original cost.


Investors should carefully consider a Fund’s investment objectives, 
      risks, charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus, containing 
      this and other important information, can be obtained from your 
      financial adviser, or by calling the Sales Desk at 800-858-8850, ext. 
      6003. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
