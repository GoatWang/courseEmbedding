Affordable Housing Program





The Affordable Housing Program
                             (AHP) allows the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
                            to  address, in partnership with member institutions,
                            affordable-housing needs primarily in communities
                            across New England. A portion of the Bank's
                            net earnings funds the program, which awards grants
                            and low-interest advances, or loans, through member
                            institutions.






How the AHP Works
The AHP encourages local planning of affordable-housing 
                                initiatives. The Bank's member institutions work with 
                                local housing organizations to apply for funds to support 
                                initiatives that serve very low- to moderate-income 
                                households in their communities.
Each year, funding for projects submitted to the AHP 
                                by member institutions is awarded in at least one competitive round. Subsidized loans (advances) and direct subsidies 
                                (grants) are available. The actual terms are determined 
                                by the member financial-institution applicant, based 
                                on the specific needs of the development.

The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Announces 2016 Third Quarter Results and Declares Dividend

BOSTON, Oct. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston announced its preliminary, unaudited third quarter financial results for 2016, reporting net income of $36.6 million for the quarter. The Bank expects to file its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, next month.








The Bank's board of directors also declared a dividend equal to an annual yield of 3.80 percent, the approximate daily average three-month LIBOR yield for the third quarter of 2016 plus 300 basis points. The dividend, based on average stock outstanding for the third quarter of 2016, will be paid on November 2, 2016.
"Earnings were solid and consistent again in the third quarter, and the balance sheet of the Bank remains strong, allowing the continued payment of an attractive dividend of three-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points, per our stated 2016 objective," said President and Chief Executive Officer Edward A. Hjerpe III. "In addition, we are pleased to note that as of mid-October, the Bank has disbursed more than $40 million in Jobs for New England advances this year, including more than $3 million in subsidies, to members that have used the funds to help their customers create or preserve more than 1,600 jobs throughout the six New England states."
Third Quarter 2016 Operating Highlights
Net income for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, was $36.6 million, compared with net income of $30.5 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an additional $8.6 million of net interest income partially offset by $2.3 million interest subsidies for Jobs for New England and Helping to House New England programs. These results led to a $4.1 million contribution to the Bank's Affordable Housing Program for the quarter.
Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $64.8 million compared with $56.2 million for the same period in 2015. The $8.6 million increase was primarily attributable to a $3.2 billion increase in average earning assets from $54.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $57.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The growth in average earning assets was driven by a $4.3 billion increase in average advances balances that was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in average investments balances. Offsetting the benefit from the increase in average earning assets was a $1.5 million decrease in net prepayment fees from advances and investments from $1.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $50,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
Net interest spread was 0.39 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a three basis point increase from the same period in 2015, as a 16 basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets was partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin was 0.45 percent, a four basis point increase from 2015. The expansion of net interest spread and net interest margin was primarily attributable to the increase of higher-yielding long term assets such as long-term advances and mortgage-backed securities. 
September 30, 2016 Balance-Sheet Highlights
Total assets increased $2.4 billion, or 4.2 percent, to $60.5 billion at September 30, 2016, up from $58.1 billion at year-end 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, advances increased $1.1 billion, or 3.1 percent, to $37.2 billion, compared with $36.1 billion at year-end 2015. The increase from year-end 2015 was concentrated primarily in variable-rate advances.
Total investments were $19.3 billion at September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 6.9 percent, compared with $18.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase was concentrated in short-term money market investments, which grew by $429.1 million, U.S. Treasury obligations, which increased $399.1 million, and mortgage-backed securities, which grew by $360.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Mandatorily redeemable capital stock declined $8.2 million to $33.8 million as of September 30, 2016, from $42.0 million at year-end 2015. GAAP capital at September 30, 2016, was $3.2 billion, an increase of $129.8 million from $3.0 billion at year-end 2015. Capital stock decreased by $3.4 million, resulting from capital stock repurchases of $317.6 million offset by capital stock issuances of $314.3 million to support increased advances borrowings by certain members. Total retained earnings increased by $51.3 million, or 4.5 percent, to $1.2 billion from December 31, 2015. Restricted retained earnings totaled $217.3 million at September 30, 2016. Accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled $360.6 million at September 30, 2016, an improvement of $82.0 million, or 18.5 percent, from December 31, 2015.
The Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2016, and in the most recent information available was classified "adequately capitalized" by its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, based on the Bank's financial information at June 30, 2016.(1)

 (1)   
 For additional information on the Bank's capital requirements, see Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016 (the 2015 Annual Report). 






 (2)   
 Investments include available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, trading securities, interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold. 






 (3)   
 The Bank's capital plan and a joint capital enhancement agreement among all Federal Home Loan Banks require the Bank to allocate a certain percentage of quarterly net income to a restricted retained earnings account until a total required allocation is met. The allocation percentage is typically 20 percent of quarterly net income. Amounts in the restricted retained earnings account are unavailable to be paid as dividends. For additional information, see Item 5 — Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in the 2015 Annual Report. 






 (4)   
 MVE equals the difference between the theoretical market value of assets and the theoretical market value of liabilities, and the ratio of MVE to par value of Bank capital stock can be an indicator of future net income to the extent that it demonstrates the impact of prior interest-rate movements on the capacity of the current balance sheet to generate net interest income. However, this ratio does not always provide an accurate indication of future net income. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on this ratio and are encouraged to read the Bank's discussion of MVE, including discussion of the limitations of MVE as a metric, in Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Measurement of Market and Interest Rate Risk in the 2015 Annual Report. 






 (5)    
 Yields for quarterly periods are annualized. 






 (6)    
 Return on average equity is net income divided by the total of the average daily balance of outstanding Class B capital stock, accumulated other comprehensive loss, and total retained earnings.

The words "preliminary," "expects," "is likely," "will," and similar statements and their plural and negative forms are used in this notification to identify some, but not all, of such forward-looking statements.

Accordingly, the Bank cautions that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements or could impact the extent to which a particular objective, projection, estimate or prediction is realized and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements.
