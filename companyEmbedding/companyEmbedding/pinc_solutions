Hair Loss Conditions
Hair Loss Causes
Hair Growth Cycle





HAIR LOSS 101
Alopecia, the medical term for hair loss, is a common condition affecting millions of men and women worldwide. Hair loss presents in a variety of ways and can vary greatly from person to person. Thinning hair, a receding hairline, bald spots, or excessive shedding are all effects of hair loss and can be caused by factors such as age, disease or genetics.
Hair loss is progressive and can result from a combination of miniaturized hair follicles and a shortened hair growth cycle. As follicles miniaturize, they produce thinner, shorter and lighter hair, which can’t adequately replace hairs that are naturally shed. As the miniaturization process progresses, hair growth stops, resulting in a dead follicle that can no longer produce hair.
Shedding 50-100 hairs a day is normal. If you are losing more than that, or your hair loss is advanced, you may be wondering why your hair is falling out. Start your research by gaining an understanding of the hair growth cycle and the causes of hair loss.

COMMON CAUSES OF ALOPECIA AND THINNING HAIR
Numerous factors contribute to hair loss. While only a doctor can determine the exact cause of hair loss, common triggers include:




Age
Genetics
Diseases and medical conditions
Hormonal imbalances
Prescription medications
Harsh styling practices
Poor diet

For informational purposes only. The exact cause of hair loss can only be determined by a medical professional.










Even though you may be suffering from hair loss, you have options.




HAIR LOSS SOLUTIONS
Start with maintaining a proper diet to ensure your hair is getting the nutrients it needs to strengthen and grow. Take steps to reduce stress to a manageable level. Try washing your hair daily to remove build-up and excess sebum to ensure your follicles aren’t clogged.  Also, avoid using hot styling tools daily or wearing tight braids, ponytails and buns for extended periods of time. If your hair loss is the result of a medical condition or treatment, consult with your doctor. Together, you can review possible alternative treatments that don’t cause hair loss. 
Have you tried other hair loss products, but nothing really worked? If you’re still dreaming of a full head of hair, our hair loss experts can help. We offer a free, no-obligation hair analysis. Our experts will analyze the condition of your hair and scalp with a high-powered microscope to determine your level of hair loss and which of our solutions is right for your specific needs. Our proven solutions include non-surgical and surgical options as well as products and services to help you get the hair you’ve always wanted. Click the icons below to learn more.

RTLS: PINC Solutions Introduces Yard Hound Product Suite For Cost-Effective Real-Time Yard Visibility And Management


PINC Solutions, the leader in cost-effective real-time asset visibility technology, introduces the latest generation of Yard Hound Product Suite, a revolution in RTLS enabled yard management systems. Designed as a turnkey solution for rapid deployment without impacting ongoing operations, Yard Hound leverages low-cost passive RFID technologies to track the location and status of trailers in real time, trace the movements of yard trucks in the yard, and provide live information for all the yard activities via an intuitive, web-based application, accessible remotely, 24/7. The modular components of Yard Hound Product Suite include: pincGATE to produce automated electronic documentations of all traffic entering into and exiting from the yard, pincSPOTTER to provide real-time location information of the trailers and yard trucks, pincDIRECTOR to facilitate visual communication of task assignments to the yard truck drivers in the yard, pincREEFER to enable remote temperature and fuel-level monitoring of refrigerated trailers, as well as many other specialized components. To further minimize the burden on customers' IT resources, PINC also offers hosted service with round-the-clock technical support as an option for Yard Hound.
Built on an innovative combination of advanced sensor and passive RFID technologies as the RTLS platform, PINC's products represent a paradigm shift in mobile asset management through real-time asset visibility. PINC's top-tier clients include Fortune-500 world leaders in transportation, manufacturing and retail. Yard Hound products are currently deployed at multiple customer sites supporting live operations. These systems have already proven their value through immediate efficiency improvements in customers' daily operations. Additional features of Yard Hound such as automated custom alerts and performance reports provide further benefits through increased productivity, reduced surcharges and insurance premiums, and enhanced customer service. Yard Hound can be installed as a standalone YMS, or can be integrated into the corporate logistics network linking the WMS and TMS. The resulting improvements in economics typically generate a positive ROI for our customers in less than a year.
About PINC Solutions 
 PINC is a privately held company headquartered in Berkeley, California. Its real time asset management solution, Yard Hound, is deployed at industry-leading customers in manufacturing, retail and transportation sectors throughout North America.  PINC has pioneered the development of RTLS products using passive RFID, MEMS and other low-cost sensors to determine the item position, eliminating the need for heavy capital investment in the infrastructure.

PINC Solutions Expands Yard Hound Product to Serve Multiple DCs
By: PINC Solutions | March 26, 2008

PINC Solutions, a vendor of technology for real-time visibility of distribution and logistics assets, has announced the latest expansion of its suite of Yard Hound products. Built with a scalable architecture, Yard Hound can be deployed to address critical issues first, then later expanded in line with customer needs. The family of products includes several modules. Yard Hound Guard monitors trailer traffic through the gate in real time, keeping track of the location and age of trailers in the yard. For fleet trailers with permanent tags attached, it enables automation of check-in and check-out processes. Yard Hound Locator tracks the location of the mobile asset in the yard. Live information about trailer and yard truck movement is collected continuously; performance analyses such as yard truck and lane utilization can be generated automatically based on custom metrics. Yard Hound Director presents all of the real-time information available from Yard Hound Locator through PINC's intuitive, Web-based user interface. With the in-cab touchscreen monitor option, it allows two-way communication between yard managers and truck drivers for sending and confirming the receipt of trailer move tasks. In addition, PINC is offering several optional components to extend system features, such as temperature monitoring of refrigerated trailers.http://www.pincsolutions.com

Contact The Supplier

A breakthrough in Real-Time-Location-System (RTLS) tracking technology to streamline yard operations without the need for new infrastructure at the customer site BERKELEY, CA – November 9, 2007 – PINC Solutions, the leader in cost-effective real-time asset visibility technology, introduces the latest generation of Yard Hound™ Product Suite, a revolution in RTLS enabled yard management systems. Designed as a turnkey solution for rapid deployment without impacting ongoing operations, Yard Hound™ leverages low-cost passive RFID technologies to track the location and status of trailers in real time, trace the movements of yard trucks in the yard, and provide live information for all the yard activities via an intuitive, web-based application, accessible remotely, 24/7. The modular components of Yard Hound™ Product Suite include: pincGATE to produce automated electronic documentations of all traffic entering into and exiting from the yard, pincSPOTTER to provide real-time location information of the trailers and yard trucks, pincDIRECTOR to facilitate visual communication of task assignments to the yard truck drivers in the yard, pincREEFER to enable remote temperature and fuel-level monitoring of refrigerated trailers, as well as many other specialized components. To further minimize the burden on customers’ IT resources, PINC also offers hosted service with round-the-clock technical support as an option for Yard Hound™. Built on an innovative combination of advanced sensor and passive RFID technologies as the RTLS platform, PINC's products represent a paradigm shift in mobile asset management through real-time asset visibility.

Additional features of Yard Hound™ such as automated custom alerts and performance reports provide further benefits through increased productivity, reduced surcharges and insurance premiums, and enhanced customer service. Yard Hound™ can be installed as a standalone YMS, or can be integrated into the corporate logistics network linking the WMS and TMS. The resulting improvements in economics typically generate a positive ROI for our customers in less than a year.About PINC Solutions – PINC is a privately held company headquartered in Berkeley, California. Its real time asset management solution, Yard Hound™, is deployed at industry-leading customers in manufacturing, retail and transportation sectors throughout North America. PINC has pioneered the development of RTLS products using passive RFID, MEMS and other low-cost sensors to determine the item position, eliminating the need for heavy capital investment in the infrastructure.

Hair Growth Cycle





HAIR LOSS 101
Alopecia, the medical term for hair loss, is a common condition affecting millions of men and women worldwide. Hair loss presents in a variety of ways and can vary greatly from person to person. Thinning hair, a receding hairline, bald spots, or excessive shedding are all effects of hair loss and can be caused by factors such as age, disease or genetics.
Hair loss is progressive and can result from a combination of miniaturized hair follicles and a shortened hair growth cycle. As follicles miniaturize, they produce thinner, shorter and lighter hair, which can’t adequately replace hairs that are naturally shed. As the miniaturization process progresses, hair growth stops, resulting in a dead follicle that can no longer produce hair.
Shedding 50-100 hairs a day is normal. If you are losing more than that, or your hair loss is advanced, you may be wondering why your hair is falling out. Start your research by gaining an understanding of the hair growth cycle and the causes of hair loss.

COMMON CAUSES OF ALOPECIA AND THINNING HAIR
Numerous factors contribute to hair loss. While only a doctor can determine the exact cause of hair loss, common triggers include:




Age
Genetics
Diseases and medical conditions
Hormonal imbalances
Prescription medications
Harsh styling practices
Poor diet

For informational purposes only. The exact cause of hair loss can only be determined by a medical professional.










Even though you may be suffering from hair loss, you have options.




HAIR LOSS SOLUTIONS
Start with maintaining a proper diet to ensure your hair is getting the nutrients it needs to strengthen and grow. Take steps to reduce stress to a manageable level. Try washing your hair daily to remove build-up and excess sebum to ensure your follicles aren’t clogged.  Also, avoid using hot styling tools daily or wearing tight braids, ponytails and buns for extended periods of time. If your hair loss is the result of a medical condition or treatment, consult with your doctor. Together, you can review possible alternative treatments that don’t cause hair loss. 
Have you tried other hair loss products, but nothing really worked? If you’re still dreaming of a full head of hair, our hair loss experts can help. We offer a free, no-obligation hair analysis. Our experts will analyze the condition of your hair and scalp with a high-powered microscope to determine your level of hair loss and which of our solutions is right for your specific needs. Our proven solutions include non-surgical and surgical options as well as products and services to help you get the hair you’ve always wanted. Click the icons below to learn more.
