The Gibson Family of America and ScotlandThe Gibson Family>The Gibson Shield of ArmsThe Thomas Gibson Shield of Arms and Crest The Shield: Blue with three storks rising. The Crest: Out of a ducal coronet, a lion's gamb grasping a club.Our Motto: "Recte et fideliter" Translated: Just and faithful.   >The Gibson Tartan[The official Gibson Family Tartan consists of  six colors. and is registered as number 2164 with the Scottish Tartan Authority. The colors of Hunting Green, Red, Yellow, White, Blue and Azure, indicate a family of high rank, nobility and leadership. The tartan kilt is a traditional garment of modern Scottish and Celtic (more specifically Gaelic) culture typically worn by men. With multiple descent from the House of Stewart,  members of our family are also authorized to wear the Royal Stewart Tartan. (More tartan information.)]["In July of 1690, William Gibson, a leader of  a Clan,  was with King William III of England during the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland,  against James 2nd the dethroned King of England.  His gallantry in the battle caused King William, known as William of Orange,  to make him a Lord. William of Orange also gave him a castle and grant in Yorkshire, England.  He took the name of Lord Durie,  the title his descendants maintain to this day."  William "Lord Durie", was the grandson of William born in 1576.] (A superb reference is "The Scottish Nation,  A Biographical History of the People of Scotland" by William Anderson,  printed in London in 1877: Gibson pages.)   The following ancestry tree is based on 2008 information from Thomas Knowlton Gibson and his website http://gibson.mayflowerman.com (or as of 2015 http://www.shohola.com/knowlton).  As Thomas Gibson intently researches this family tree, the information below may be out of date, and his website may reflect updated/corrected information.  It is important to note that there are two possible ancestries for the 1690s John Gibson of Philadelphia -- this Boston-Scottish one, and a Pennsylvania-English one (see below in the footnote).         Lord Thomas Gibson (1469-1515) was born at Goldingstones, County Fife, Scotland, the second son of Andrew (ref.) and chartered First Baron by King James IV.  Married Lady Mary (1471-1551).    He was a Free Baron under Charter by King James IV of Scotland and appointed Clerk of Session (ref.) of the Parliament of Scotland.1. George Gibson (1491-1538) was chartered Second Baron and Clerk of Session (ref.) of the Parliament of Scotland after the death of his father.2.  William Gibson (1495-7/7/1542) Lord William was Vicar of Garvock, Rector of Inverarity, Dean of Restalrig, Lord of Session and Scottish Ambassador to the Pope in Rome.3. Andrew  Gibson (1498-1567) married in 1517, raised two sons and at least two daughters.  (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.) 4. Thomas Gibson (1503-1562 ) married in 1521, raised two sons and three daughters.  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)5./6. and at least two daughters [Unfortunately, very little is recorded of the female side of our early Gibson ancestors.]  "The life of Ambassador, Lord William Gibson was recorded in a charter by Sir John Moubray, of Barnbougle, knight, in favour of his son, William de Moubray, in 1511." The life of Lord Thomas was the beginning of a well documented era of Barony, Knighthood, Heraldry, Landed Gentry, Peerage, and other designated nobility. Our Gibson ancestors descended from Kenneth I MacAlpin, Eochaid King of the Picts, the High Kings of Ireland and nine centuries of Scottish Royal Families. [As more old world ancestral records are placed on line, we now have access to records that were very difficult and expensive to obtain just a few years ago.  (ref.)  (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.) ]  Lord George Gibson I (1491-1538), first son of Thomas, was chartered Second Baron and Lord of Session of the Parliament of Scotland after the death of his father. He was a Free Baron under Charter by King James V of Scotland and raised three sons and two daughters. Married Lady Elizabeth (1495-?), recorded as descended from Cináed mac Ailp�n, in modern regnal listed as Kenneth I, King of the Picts and first King of Scots.1. Mary Gibson (1514-?) -- descendency unknown (with most daughters named Mary, Elizabeth, Jean or Margaret, it was obviously very confusing for late 19th century genealogists.)2. George  Gibson (1517-1590)  Lord George was the heir to the Barony, the family estate and fortune recorded to exceed 8200 pound Scot.  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)3. Elizabeth Gibson (1521-?) (note: it is likely that George had more daughters that have not been recorded.)4. William Gibson (1525-?) was married in 1554 and raised at least three sons and two daughters.  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.) 5. Thomas  Gibson (1528-?) was married in 1547 and raised at least two sons and two daughters.  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)[With so many Gibsons with the same first name, it is no wonder early genealogists were confused.  Some would  pick the most noble family ancestors to impress their clients, and justify their pay.]     Lord George Gibson II (1517-1590) Second son of George, he was chartered Third Baron, County Judge, and  George was a Free Baron under Charter by Mary I, Queen of Scots.  (ref.)  (ref.) He married Lady Mary Cranston in 1542, the daughter of  Lord Alexander Cranston of  Roxburgh, a descendant of Thomas de Cranstoun,  Lord Provost of  Edinburgh in 1425, 1438 and 1449.1. Thomas Gibson (1543-1521) married in 1564, and raised at five children. (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  Three grandsons were early settlers in Jamestown, VA with many descendants.  (Ref.)2.  George Gibson (1545-1644)    Lord George, married in 1565, raised six sons and three daughters, lived a long life and  was the heir to the Barony and the family estate. (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.)         3. William  b. 1548 - 1596    Catholic Bishop, William the Martyr, was hanged, drawn and quartered at York, on Nov 29, 1596, with fellow martyrs William Knight and George Errington.4./5./6.+ and at least three daughters [Many early Gibsons were devout Catholics until the Protestant Reformation initiated by Martin  Luther, John Calvin and in Scotland by John Knox around 1660. Here is a superb website of old world Gibsons prepared by the Rev. Dr. Gary Stewart Gibson of Devon, UK, and his father, John Robert Gibson  (1896-1991).]             Lord George Gibson III (1545-1644), second Son of George II, chartered Fourth Baron, Parliament Lord of Session, and Judge of the of High Court of Scotland. George was a Free Baron under Charter by King James VI of Scotland, and King Charles I. (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)  He married Lady Mary Elizabeth Airth  Married in 1565, Mary was born in Castle Stirling in 1549 from the ancient and noble Scottish family of Airth.  (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.)1. John Gibson (1566-?) was Sir John Gibson of Pentland, Lord Baronet, who carried on the line of the family and married Jean Hay,  of noble birth and royal ancestry.  (ref.)2. Jean Gibson (~1568-?) -- descendancy unknown (Unfortunately, very little information was recorded of the Gibson Ladies.   Jean is probably Jean Hay who married Sir John Hay.)  (ref.)  (ref.)3. Elizabeth Gibson (~1569     I have not been able to find any information on Elizabeth and Mary, the daughters of George Gibson III.  (ref.)  (ref.)  (ref.) (ref.)  (ref.)4. Alexander Gibson (1571-1644), First Lord Durie, First Lord Baronet and Lord Clerk Register m. Lady Margaret Craig, daughter of Sir Thomas Craig, Lord Advocate and Judge.5. George Gibson IV  (1574-1641) was Lord George IV of Balhouffie, a Free Baron, who had a son, grandson and great grandson named George, all wealthy barons.6.  William  Gibson (1576-1658), a Free Baron,  was Lord of Session and had a son John, b. 1606 who fled to Galway, Ireland in 1640, and is recorded by some as Sir John Sr. below.7.  Archibald Gibson (1578 -1647) raised six children with many descendants in Scotland, England, Canada and the British colonies (ref.) (ref.),  including merchant James Gibson.8. Thomas Gibson (1580 -1650) Many colonial Gibsons descended through Thomas's son, James Thomas,  who was b. 1607.  His son Edmund was born in 1633 and married Jane Langhorn.9. Mary Gibson (~1581-?) -- descendency unknown       Great grandsons were,  Lord Edmund Gibson b. 1669,  Bishop of London from 1723 to 1748, and Jonathan, born in 1660, married Mary Catlett in 1710, and emigrated to Virginia in 1696.  Their son, Jonathan Catlett, married Elizabeth Thornton and was the first of five generations of Jonathan Catlett Gibsons. Descendants of Jonathan and Mary  were ancestors to many famous Virginians including Geo. Washington through his mother Mary Ball Washington. A Famous descendant  of Alexander is Sir Alexander Gibson 1926-1995, conductor of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and founder of the Scottish Opera. Famous descendants of  William are James Gibson-Craig with his son William Gibson-Craig,  both having served high positions in the Scottish Parliament. A descendant of Thomas is Thomas Milner Gibson, 1806-1884,  a member of the British Parliament. Many Canadian Gibson also descended from this branch.    >Lord Durie -- Alexander Gibson (1571-1644)The image is Lord Alexander Gibson, Fifth Baron, First Lord Durie in 1621, First Lord Baronet in 1628, and Lord Clerk Register in 1641.        [Many of the early Gibsons as loyal followers of John Knox, played a significant part in the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, the establishment of the Church of Scotland and the worldwide Presbyterian Church, especially after 1560.] (ref.) [Many early members of the Gibson family emigrated to the colonies in the early 1600's "Great Migration",  just before and during the English Civil War,  escaping civil unrest (especially toward the Landed Gentry and Nobility),  during the reign of King Charles I, and then  Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell.] [There is an old of a Scottish ditty titled "Lord George Knows My Father, Father Knows Lord George",  in comical reference to the seven Lord George Gibsons.] [A descendant of Alexander is Edward Gibson, chartered 1st Baron Ashbourne,  Queen's Counsel  elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Dublin University and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.] Many Gibsons served in the Parliament of Scotland until the Acts of Union formed the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.  Their descendants then served in the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London from 1707 until 1999.  Two descendants, Kenneth Gibson and Robert Gibson continue to serve today in the new Scottish Parliament formed in 1999.Lord Alexander Gibson (1571-1644) Second son of George, chartered Fifth Baron, First Lord Durie in 1621, First Lord Baronet in 1628, and Lord Clerk Register. He married Lady Margaret Craig (1575-?)  The daughter of Lord Thomas Craig of Riccarton, (1538-?), Lord Advocate, and early Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh. Lord Thomas was an eminent lawyer, Member of Parliament, and Judge of the High Court of Scotland, under King Charles II. 1. Alexander II Gibson (1598-6/1656) Knighted in 1621, he was appointed Clerk of Session in 1628, Clerk of Parliament in 1632, Second Lord Baronet, and Lord of Session in 1646.2. John Gibson I (1601-1694), a successful shipping merchant and heir to family fortune, left most of it behind when he and Rebecca emigrated to Cambridge in Massachusetts.3. George  Gibson (1604-1669)  served as Lord of Parliament and ultimately received most of the family fortune and the Barony, then passed them on to his many descendants. (ref.).4. Elizabeth Gibson (~1606-?)   5. Helen Gibson (~1609-?)  6. Margaret Gibson (~1610-?)    7. Jean Gibson (1613-1676) married George Preston 1612 - 1659 of Craigmillar, Scotland, they were 8th great grandparents of animator and film producer, Walt Disney.Alexander II's son John II, Third Lord Baronet, sat in the last Parliament of Scotland and the first Scottish Parliament of Charles II. John II's son Alexander III's, Fourth Lord Baronet, died without issue passing the Barony to his uncle George.(ref.) (ref.) (ref.) (ref.) (ref.) If John would have remained in Scotland he would have received the Barony and most of the family fortune. (ref.) (ref.) (ref.) (ref.) Sir John Gibson (1601 Scotland-1694 Massachusetts) --  The immigrant, ref p. 388, a "free thinking" merchant, he fled from Scotland in 1631 abandoning a significant family fortune. (see references).  John, an early "uncompromising Presbyterian" like his brothers, emigrated to Newetowne in 1631 which became Cambridge in 1638.  He married (1) Lady Rebecca Thompson (1613-1661) in 1634, the daughter of the well know Scottish nobleman Lord William Thompson (1580-1671) arrived in 1633, and (2) Joanna Prentice in 1662. After making false witchcraft accusations, the family experienced severe financial, legal, medical, religious and emotional issues culminating with daughter Rebecca being accused of witchcraft.  In 1656, They were censured, excommunicated and banished to Roxbury. (ref.)  Rebecca Thompson Gibson died shortly after her daughter was banished and was buried in the Old Roxbury Hill Cemetery on Dec 1, 1661.  John then married Joanna Prentice, widow of Henry Prentice, on July 24, 1662 after her family experienced similar family problems.  Obviously and extremely stressful period for her and the entire family, daughter Rebecca and Charles moved to Watertown, Massachusetts.  1. Rebecca Gibson (1635-1681)  married Charles Stearns of Watertown,  Mass.  on June 22, 1654 and raised six children.  At the age of 41, he served as an officer in the King Philip's war.2. Mary Gibson (29 March 1637-?) married John Ruggles of Roxbury, Mass. on April 3, 1655, the son of  John and Barbara Ruggles and raised four children.3. Martha Gibson (29 April 1639-?) married Jacob Newell of Roxbury, Mass.  on November 3, 1657 4. John Gibson Jr. (1641-10/15/1679) married Rebecca Errington on Dec 9, 1668 the daughter of Abraham Errington and Rebecca Cutler of Cambridge.  He was a soldier in the King Philip's War.5. Samuel Gibson (10/28/1644-3/20/1709) married Sarah Pemberton on Oct 30, 1668 who died giving birth to their first child.   He then married Mrs Elizabeth (Remington) Steadman on June 14, 1679, after the death of her husband John.  Sam was a soldier in the King Philip's War,  raised five children and experienced some legal problems. [It was very uncommon to have negative ancestral information published.  A reader  would have to "read between the lines" to find out what actually occurred. Genealogist Frederick Clifton Pierce Esq,   politely discussed witchcraft,  when in 1883, he published "The Gibson Family of Cambridge",  cited on page 388. "Due to the Rebecca Gibson witchcraft fiasco, "certainly no eligible man, widowed or single,  would consider sister-in-law Rebecca (Errington) Gibson for a wife".]John Gibson Jr. (1641-1679) was born in Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts, the oldest son and fourth child. John, an inexperienced officer, was "encouraged" by his step grandfather, Captain Thomas Prentice to assist him fighting in the King Philip's war. He married Rebecca Errington (1643-12/4/1713) on  12/9/1668, the daughter of Abraham Errington and Rebecca Cutler, descended from the father of Catholic Martyr, Bishop George Errington.   Rebecca experienced "financial difficulty" and received a small amount of financial assistance from the church, after the death of John in 1679. She struggled to raise her young family alone and in 1680 was identified by church elders as an "unsuitable mother". (ref.)  After a brief session in court, her children were taken from her and placed with "suitable church families". Rebecca was then "put out by the selectman to families in the country", obviously an extremely difficult time for her with no record of her death.1. Rebecca  Gibson (4  Oct 1669-1788)  was a "troubled child", never married and died young.  (ref.)  There are obvious omissions in this sanitized text by Mehitable Wilson from 1900.2. Martha Gibson (14 Aug 1671-1733) married (1) Reben Lilly of Concord and (2) Joseph Knight of Woburn, Massachusetts 1673-1732.  (ref.)3. Mary Gibson (1673-1732) was raised with the family of Stephen Gates of Stow Massachusetts  and married his son Nathaniel Gates (1675-1731) on Oct 17, 1700. (ref.)4. John Gibson III (1676-1751).  It would appear that young John, obviously intelligent and well educated, had a different view on life and was apparently quite unhappy with his life in Cambridge. "Under a bad influence, he was excommunicated for his radical views".  This was not a good time to be a Quaker in the Massachusetts Bay Colonies. Similar incidents a few years earlier resulted in a swift execution.   The church elders then attempted to erase any and all records of his existence.5. Timothy Gibson (1679-7/14/1757) grew up with the family of Stephen Gates of Stow Massachusetts.  He was well educated,  became a church deacon and married  daughter Rebecca Gates.  Timothy's son, Captain Timothy Gibson II, and grandson, Captain Timothy Gibson III,  proudly fought in the revolution with honor and distinction. Descendants of Timothy include, shipping merchant Captain Nehemiah Gibson, Boston merchant Charles Gibson and Gibson Girl artist Charles Dana Gibson. (Well-known living descendants of Timothy are artist William Gibson, writer and Jeopardy star Hutton Gibson, and his famous son's, actors Donal and Mel Gibson. [Hollywood producer and director, Mel Gibson is very aware of our family history.] [Obviously,  some of the Gibson family members were very independent in their thinking and NOT active members of  the Cambridge community or the established church.] [Contrary to popular belief,  the Massachusetts Bay Colonies were NOT founded on religious freedom,  a few years earlier many Quakers were executed for their belief.] [I (TKG 2008) have been searching for more than thirty years for information on the "Halsall" "Halsell" or "Hulsell" Quakers.  Who was this group that existed about 350 years ago?]John Gibson III (1676-1751 Philadelphia,PA), MAYBE (see notes below) fourth child and oldest son of John Jr., he was an early colonial Philadelphia resident and friend of the family of William Penn. He married Anne St. Clair  (1677-1748) in 1699, the sister of early Pennsylvania settler William St. Clair, the grand father of Continental Army General Arthur St. Clair. Arthur St. Clair was President of the United States in Congress Assembled when the United States Constitution was enacted. John espoused the cause of the Halsall Quakers and with community antagonism toward his religion, departed the hostile Bay Colony area as a young man, arriving in the Quaker friendly city of Philadelphia, some time between 1690 and 1693, and probably indentured. An early teacher and administrator of Friends Select School in Philadelphia, he was called by Attorney General David Lloyd in 1696, to help frame the Charter of Privileges, (especially his religious freedom writings in section one), the first Constitution of Pennsylvania. It remained in effect until 1777 with some of his writing appearing in the U.S. Constitution, written in 1786, and still in use today.1. John Gibson IV (1700-1700) -- died in infancy 2. Robert Gibson (1702 Philadelphia,PA-1756 Cumberland,PA)   3. George Gibson Sr. (1704-1761), with his famous sons General John Gibson and Colonel George Gibson, were early settlers and founders of Lancaster, in Lancaster County, PA. -- [however, most genealogies list this "Lancaster" George as being a "Scots-Irish" born in Stewartstown,Ulster,Ireland in 1704, married to Martha Deviney -- and not belonging to the above tree. Children: Mary (1734-?) married Mattias Clough, Thomas (1737-?), John (5/23/1740 Lancaster,PA-1782 Lancaster,PA) married Anna Ball, Frances (1742-?), Jean (1745-?), George (10/10/1747 Lancaster,PA-1/4/1791 Lancaster,PA) married Ann West and Ann (1749-?). note-this Ann is too old to have married Jesse Britton who was born in 1759.]4. Rebecca Gibson (1707-1776) -- descendency unknown -- perhaps married a Quaker and stayed in Philadelphia.5. Moses Gibson (1710 Philadelphia,PA-1764 Loudon,VA) remained a Quaker, moved to Virginia, became a successful planter and tobacco merchant, and built a beautiful  plantation home named "Valley View". Married Elsie Janney from Bucks,PA circa 1734; the Janney family had strong Quaker ties. Children: Isaac, Joseph, James, John, Thomas, Moses, Rebecca, Anne. Anne was born ~1753 and married an Unknown Smith -- she is not the Anne Gibson who married Jesse Britton.  [Thomas Knowlton Gibson is descended from Moses so: Isaac-Moses-Minor-Isaac-Muscoe-Joseph-Thomas-Thomas -- see his website]6. Mary Gibson (1712-1783) married and moved west, probably to western Virginia or Kentucky.7. Anne Gibson (1715-1736) married John Frame in 1735 and died during the birth of her first child.  John remarried shortly thereafter.8. William Gibson (1717-1771) married, moved to western Pennsylvania and raised a large family with many descendants who settled in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. Famous Tony Award winner playwright William Gibson, writer of The Miracle Worker, the story of  Helen Keller's education, was descended from William.Many of John Gibson III's sons and grandsons named a son John, James, George or William who served in the colonial or Continental Army. Major General John Gibson (born 23 May 1740), Ref. p. 481, was a commander and governor of the Indiana Territory from 1800 to 1816. Colonel George Gibson b.10 Oct 1747, was a Commander in the Colonial Army and led the famous Gibson's Lambs of Lancaster, PA. He later served with his uncle, Major General Arthur St. Clair and was killed in the disastrous Battle of the Wabash or St. Clair's defeat. George was the father of the Honorable John Bannister Gibson, a highly respected Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. He was also the father of Private George Gibson, a significant member of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Grandson Isaac was an officer in the Prince William Co. Colonial Brigade, and great grandson James Gibson, was a Colonel in the War of 1812. Another grandson, John Gibson, son of William, was an early colonial mayor of Philadelphia from December 5, 1772, to May 21, 1773.  Other descendants went on to become founders of York, Pennsylvania, west of Lancaster, with two serving terms as York City Mayor.Note: the ancestors of these children are not confirmed.  There is another ancestry possible for Robert and Moses -- see footnote below -- as well as another ancestry mentioned above for George.  Also note that Thomas Knowlton Gibson's research does not delve into the descendants of Robert Gibson b.1702. Moses Gibson is an unusual name, and the fact that Robert names a son Moses, and moves to Bucks where his brother's wife is from seems to confirm a relationship between Moses and Robert -- whether they are related to George and William (and the women Rebecca, Mary and Anne) is open to further research.Robert Gibson (1702 Philadelphia,PA-?) -- nothing is known of this Robert, so it is uncertain if "our" Robert Gibson, patriot who died in 1788, belongs to this Robert.1. Robert Gibson (~1730s-1788 Bucks,PA - will) married (1) Unknown and (2) the widow Elizabeth Wilson Keith.Gibson Deaths from the newspapers:James Gibson of Plumstead, died Sep 22, 1816, age 50 (born ~1766);John Gibson formerly of Doylestown, died Dec 3, 1828 (age unspecified);Robert Gibson of Doylestown, died March 25, 1820, age 23 (born ~1796);Thomas Gibson of Bedminster, died Feb 18, 1818, age 50 (born ~1767). John and Robert are likely Thomas Gibson's children, and apparently both died young, perhaps unmarried.Almost every living Gibson in the world is descended from Lord Thomas Gibson of Goldingstones, obviously excepting those who were adopted or changed their surname. Many Gibsons in the United States, especially the New England area, are descended from immigrant John Gibson of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Others descend from one of the seven George Gibsons, with many immigrating to the south and then westward, especially to Kentucky, Indiana and Texas. Henry C. Gibson of Maybrook, was one of the richest men in Philadelphia (wine and spirits, banking, insurance, railroading), and a patron of the arts. Luthier, Orville H. Gibson founder of the Gibson Guitar Company, and namesake of the world famous Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, and George Gibson, founder of  The Gibson Art and Gibson Greeting Companies descend from George Gibson, son of John III of Philadelphia.  Famous TV Gibsons are ABC Evening New anchor Charles "Charlie" Gibson, Fox News reporter John Gibson and CBS Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson.  Well known Gibson recording artists are Eric and Liegh Gibson, gospel singer Jonathan Gibson and minimalist musician, Jon Gibson. We have two  NASA Astronauts, U.S. Navy Captain, Commander Robert Lee "Hoot" Gibson, and Skylab 4 Astronaut and engineer, Edward George Gibson. Thomas Gibson Walton, father of American businessman and entrepreneur Sam Walton, descended from Moses Gibson and Elsie Janney, through their son Thomas. In the United Kingdom, Baron Richard Patrick Tallentyre Gibson (1916-2004), was a British businessman in the publishing industry, and later arts administrator. Many of our family ancestors were instrumental in the drafting, signing or approving of significant historical documents in the founding of our country, including: The Magna Carta in (1215); First, Second, & Third Virginia Charters; Mayflower Compact (1620); Charter of Massachusetts Bay (1629);  Pennsylvania  Charter of Privileges (1696); Resolutions of the Stamp Act (Oct. 19, 1765); Declaration of Arms (July 6, 1775); Virginia Declaration of Rights (June 12, 1776);  Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776); Articles of Confederation (Nov. 15, 1777) in York, PA; and finally the Constitution of the United States (1787). ----------------------------As mentioned above, this information came directy from Thomas Gibson's website: http://www.shohola.com/Gibson/ -- "Welcome to the Thomas Knowlton Gibson Genealogy Page."  His information is largely from �Biographical History of York County, Illustrated 1886� by John Gibson, Historical Editor, a descendant of John III.  Thomas Knowlton Gibson confirmed that the above link to the Boston Gibsons was made due to excommunication records in Massachusetts and the concurrent appearance of a John Gibson in Philadelphia -- and the fact that the excommunication was due to Quaker beliefs and the Philadelphia John Gibson was Quaker.  Plus, William Penn's Philadelphia would have been the place to go for a Quaker at that time.  However, there are also records of a second ancestry. The above ancestry is Scottish; the second ancestry is British (having lived temporarily in Ireland prior to immigration to America).In the Pennsylvania Archives, there are mentions of a William Gibson (1629 Easton,Lancashire,England-11/20/1684  London,England) married to Elizabeth Thompson, haberdasher of London, who became a Quaker, friend of William Penn, and received land grants from him.  William is the father of at least three children: William, John and Patience, and perhaps also Rebecca, Hannah and Elizabeth (although only two children were named in his will -- see below). Patience married John Wright and died in Chester,PA on 11/15/1722 -- they had received land in Bucks,PA, and moved there circa 1699.  Before Penn left for America in August 1682, a significant alteration took place in the composition of the East Jersey proprietorship. The twelve associates agreed "to take in three persons more, to make up the number of proprietors to twenty-four." This was accomplished by each owner transferring half his share to a new proprietor. Since Wilcox had sold his share, there were eleven old proprietors and thirteen new proprietors. The new proprietors consisted of five London men, all Quakers, two Dublin men (both Quakers) six Scots, three of who were Quakers.The London men were Edward Byllynge, gentleman and brewer of Westminster and chief proprietor of West Jersey, now solvent again; William GIBSON, citizen and haberdasher and a prominent Quaker minister; Thomas Barker, merchant; Gawan Lawrie, merchant; and James Brain, son-in-law of Groom, and a merchant. William GIBSON was a noted London Quaker who was many times imprisoned, fined, and distrained of his goods. His name appears with those of Penn, Whitehead, Barclay, and others as a signer of Epistles sent to the monthly meetings.GIBSON was not only one of the 24 Proprietors, but a first purchaser of land in Pennsylvania with an interest of 500 acres. He never came to America but did attend the proprietors' meetings in London until his death in 1784. His widow and two children were his heirs. Thomas Boell, their agent, secured for them 500 acres at Wickatunk and 2,000 acres on the Millstone. In 1687, however, the GIBSON propriety was purchased by Robert West and Thomas Cox and in 1689 Cox as trustee for West sold it to Dr. Daniel Coxe.In March 1692 when Coxe sold his holdings to the West Jersey Society he owned two East Jersey properties. One he referred to as the West share," and this was the share he had purchased from Byllynge and later regain control of. The other, "Mew's Share" he had purchased from the heirs of GIBSON since it was one-half of GIBSON's original undivided property.In the book entitled, "The Short and Itinerary Journals of George Fox," Macmillan, 1926 William GIBSON is noted as appearing frequently in the Haistwell Diary between the years 1677 and 1678..."William GIBSON, whom I know well, and who at the time of the civil wars, being a soldier at Carlisle, he and three others having heard that a Quaker meeting was appointed in that city, they agreed to go thither and abuse the preacher, whose name was Thomas Holmes, but GIBSON, who came to scoff, remained to pray and became a zealous minister. He resided in Lancashire till about 1670 when he removed to London."He took a prominent part with Fox and others in the Wilkinson-Story Controversy. dealing especially with Raunce and Harris. In 8 mo. 1684, he was reported "nigh death" (Penn's letter to M. Fox). It is said that more than a thousand Friends followed his remains from Lombard Street to Bunhill Fields. "The History and Genealogy of Fenwick's Colony," by Thomas Shourds, orig. pub. in 1876 and since reprinted by Genealogical Publishing Company is a sourcebook rich in info on NJ Quakers that may help with other lines, although Wm. Gibson is not identified in it. Beware that much of Shourds' data is questionable. -- PA ArchivesFurthermore, genealogical information on the George Gibson of Lancaster also supports a more recent emigration, and confirm a Scots-Irish tie. It is my [DLH 2008] aim to discover more information about the  Robert Gibson b.1702 and his brothers/sisters, to see if their records or biographies might help to pin down their ancestry.  However, it should be noted that the Robert Gibson in Bucks,PA in the 1770s/1780s is almost certain to be the son of Robert Gibson b.1702 in Philadelphia and the newphew of Moses Gibson b.1710 in Philadelphia.  Jesse Britton's wife Ann, born circa 1760, is thought to likely be a granddaughter of George (b.1704) or William (b.1717).From Thomas Knowlton Gibson: "You are correct about William Gibson being an early resident of Philadelphia, but he was almost certainly not the father of John Gibson born 1676 who married Anne St. Clair in Philadelphia. William was the son of John Gibson b. 1606 who fled to Galway, Ireland in 1640, who was the son of William 1576 - 1658) a Free Baron and Lord of Session. William  was born in 1641, emigrated to England from Galway around 1663, met George Fox, became a Quaker. He met and became a friend of William Penn and then emigrated to the colonies, through Baltimore or New Castle and then to Philadelphia. William certainly made significant contributions to the founding of Pennsylvania, both in London and in Philadelphia.I am very interested in any documentation indicating he is the father of John (who married Anne St. Clair in Philadelphia in 1669), as my great grandfather's records do not indicate any close relationship to William. You are correct in that I do not have a documented relationship of John, born in Cambridge 1676 and converting to Quakerism, to John Gibson of Philadelphia, recorded as being a Quaker and born in  1676. Since John of Cambridge is recorded a moving to Philadelphia around 1692  and there were very few colonists named John Gibson in Philadelphia in 1696, (actually I can find only one), I am reasonably  certain they are one and the same person. I suspect that John might have lived with his great uncle William upon  arriving in Philadelphia, which might be the reason some record him as the son of William." Later updated: "Uncle William ... it seems that he probably did not emigrate, but instead provided his land to his children." "it seems the early Philadelphia Gibson family lived in the Bristol area." Misc Gibson records: Ann Hunt born 12/14/1688 Darby, Chester Co, Pennsylvania; married (1)John Blunston, Jr. (2)Nathan Gibson (Note: John Blunston, Jr. died in 1716 and Ann married second to Nathan Gibson on Dec 7, 1719 at Darby MM) -- Darby, Chester Co, Pa There were several families of Gibsons who settled in Hopewell Township. John Gibson died in the year 1748, leaving a wife, Ann; a daughter, Mary; and a sister, Margaret. Robert Gibson died in 1754. James Gibson, of Hopewell, died in 1758, leaving a son William; grandson James Beard; (John Elliot probably married a daughter); granddaughter Margaret Elliot; a daughter married Hugh Thompson. John Elliot was an Indian trader and traded amongst the tribes in Northern Ohio for Robert Callendar. William Gibson, of Newtown Township, died in 1770, leaving children: Robert Gibson, John Gibson, Samuel Gibson, James Gibson, George Gibson, Gideon Gibson, Charles Gibson and Ann Gibson. George Gibson, the father of Judge Gibson, was the son of John Gibson, who kept tavern in Lancaster when the town was laid out. He married Ann West, the daughter of Francis West, the first magistrate of Cumberland County. At the commencement of the Revolutionary War, he and his brother John were trading among the Indians along the the Ohio. At this time there was a very disorderly spirit among the settlers at the Forks of the Ohio, which was fomented by Dr. John Connolly, and other emissaries of Lord Dunmore, who claimed jurisdiction over that country, and annexed it to Augusta County, Virginia. The Virginians evidently enlisted their sympathies. A number followed Dunmore, and were tinctured with Toryism, while others who espoused the patriot cause, accepted commissions in the Army from Virginia, and George Gibson was one of the latter. He afterwards served in the Regular Line. He went to New Orleans to procure powder, etc, for the Continental Army. He was successful in his mission, and negotiated with Oliver Pollock, who transported the powder, etc., in vessels to one of the Atlantic ports. At the close of the war, Virginia gave Colonel Gibson a warrant for land in Kentucky, but when he came to locate it, he found the land covered by a warrant of a previous date. He applied to Congress for relief, and although General Muhlenburg reported the bill favorably, for some reason or other, neither he nor his heirs received any recompense. He commanded a company at St. Clair's defeat; was mortally wounded, and when the troops were put to flight and everyone was trying to save himself, as his brother-in-law, Jacob Slough, of Lancaster, passed by him, he begged him to assist him off the field, but Slough ran on. Colonel Gibson then placed his back against a tree and drew his pistols, and sold his life dearly to the "redskins". His body was taken to Fort Washington and buried there. He resided along Shearman's Creek at the foot of "Pisgah" Mountain. The creek runs forty miles along the western base of the mountain with a meadow about five hundred feet wide, and one thousand feet long, between the creek and the dwelling. An apple orchard covers a portion of this meadow. Upon its iste, Colonel Gibson had a race course. He owned a mill near his dwelling and several hundred acres of land, which was mostly uncultivated. What induced Francis West to leae Carlisle and settle at Shearman's Creek, which at that time was cut off from other settlements by the mountains, I cannot imagine. Chief Justice Gibson was born in this house. A portion of it is now used as a "pottery". One of Gibson's slaves wounded a buck and was killed by it, where the lime kiln now is. George Gibson made his will November 12, 1791, leaving sons Francis Gibson, George Gibson, John Bannister Gibson, Patrick Henry Gibson. He devised something to William Gibson, who was a nephew of Robert Callendar. Mrs. Gibson belonged to the Church of England, and shw was very anxious to have her sons baptized by an Episcopal minister. She made known the fact to the minister, probably in Cumberland Valley, who came to Shearman's Valley, and took up his quarters at Mr. Gibson's, who finally gave his consent to have the "boys" baptized. But he very likely gave them a hint of the matter, for as long as the minister was there, they went to the mountains daily to hunt, starting before daylight and did not return until the minister had retired for the night. He finally gave up on them and returned to Carlisle without accomplishing his mission. (Source: Engle's Notes and Queries, Volume II, pages 85-86)Information from Cumberland, PA Historical Society: From:"Kaisa65@aol.com" To:dhay16301@sbcglobal.netDonna,The Cumberland County Historical Society sent the Gibson File, the Flower file, graveyard info, tax info and some other odd things, from which I've figured out the following: I think there were 3 Gibson brothers:  John, Robert and James. John's will was dated 1748, proved 1750.  Wife Ann.  Left bequest to wife, sister Mary, sister Margaret McFarlin (not in the U.S.), nephew Mathias Ferguson and daughter Mary.  Mary had guardians Richard Nicholas and Allen LEEPER.  Executors were Robert Gibson, John McClintock and Hugh THOMPSON. Robert's will was dated 1754, proved 1756 (I think this is my Robert).  His wife was Ann.  He left bequest to Ann, sons Andrew and ROBERT (my Robert? I hope); daughters Jean, Martha, Ann.   Executors were William Patton, Hugh THOMPSON and Andrew Givan.  Daughter Ann was 16 in 1768 when she chose George Brown as her guardian. James' will was proved 1758.  Wife was Jean.  Left bequest to wife, son William, son-in-laws John Elliott and Hugh THOMPSON (his will was listed in 1761.  Wife's name was Mary); granddaughter Margaret Elliott and grandson James Beard. These were all in Hopewell Township. However, in Newton Township there was a William Gibson.  His will was proved 1770.  Wife Margaret, son Robert (left him 150 acres bounded by James Young and Andrew Gibson).  Also made bequests to sons John, William, James, George, Gideon, Charles and daughters Janet and ANN.  Executors were wife Margaret and Allen LEEPER. The Flower Genealogy definitely lists John and Robert as brothers.  But the fact that Hugh Thompson married Mary Gibson (daughter of James) and was executor for Robert leads me to believe James was also a brother or cousin? And Allen Leeper turns up as guardian for John's daughter Mary, and executor for William Gibson.  Ann, daughter of Robert, would have been born in 1752.  Ann, daughter of William, would have been born closer to 1770, because she was the last child listed, and his will refers to another unborn child.  Don't know if this will help you, but thought I'd send it on.  KayReturn to Hay Tree
