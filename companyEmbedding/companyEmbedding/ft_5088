It is a good piece of south London brick infill, a reinterpretation of the city’s suburban terraced housing and a solid and respectful intervention. The architecture is determinedly contemporary but with enough rhythm and geometry to echo the bays and composition of the surrounding houses, which is itself not uniform.What is original here is not so much the architecture (although the architect, Peter Barber, is arguably the most interesting designer of housing in London today), but rather the funding model.Hafer Road is a typical terraced street in south London’s Battersea. A gap in the Victorian fabric caused by a Luftwaffe bomb during the second world war, like many of these sites it was filled in with social housing by the Greater London Council in the 1950s. This was part of a deliberate effort to mix social housing in with the established neighbourhoods of the homeowning and private-rental sectors. The residents in the replacement block had all managed to buy their homes from the council under the right-to-buy initiative introduced under Margaret Thatcher’s government in the 1980s (the ethics and economic consequences of which are another story entirely). The seven householders grouped together to build a new block, and added eight new residences that were sold for enough to fund the whole project. They effectively traded up for free.It might seem that there isn’t much unusual in this. Certainly in central Europe, in Germany, Austria, Hungary as well as in Scandinavia, there would be nothing at all out of the ordinary in this. But in Britain and in the US it does count as unusual. There is no real culture here of building for yourself, particularly communal projects like this. Instead, housing is left almost exclusively to big housebuilders that have a virtual monopoly on the supply of land. Banks and building societies are also unwilling to lend on this kind of undertaking and somehow, despite endless reality TV shows and property section features, the culture of commissioning an architect to build a development privately has not taken root.Hafer Road’s group of houses shows just how successful it can be — in both urban and financial terms. Much of this is thanks to Barber, whose specialism is social housing. That is a rare and frankly rather special specialism to have in the contemporary environment of London development. Yet he has made a notable career of it and, as a result, designed some of the city’s most urbane, intelligent and beautiful housing. His Donnybrook Quarter in Hackney looks like a hybrid between the Middle East and early avant-grade modernism, Worland Gardens in Stratford is reminiscent of inter-war vaguely Art Deco housing estates and his Holmes Road housing for the homeless, manages to mix Victorian workshop architecture, elegant mews and a jolly row of beachfront huts with the most minimal of means.Donnybrook Quarter in HackneyWorland Gardens in StratfordI know this column is not exactly aimed at social housing tenants, but there is nothing bargain basement about Barber’s architecture. It is serious, respectful and dense, and in Hafer Road he has shown how homeowners can take lessons from social housing and apply them to a broader context.

                    The City Officials welcome you on behalf of the residents of Knox. We hope that you will find this a friendly, safe and prosperous community in which to live, work, learn, and play.
The City of Knox is located in Center Township and is the county seat for Starke County, Indiana. The population was 3,721 in the 2000 census. The city was founded in 1851 and named after General Henry Knox. Knox was also the home of Indiana Governor Henry F. Schricker.

The  Knox City flag was designed by 16 year old Knox High School junior Raluca Fodorean. Raluca selected the late 19th century Romanesque tower of the Starke County courthouse to symbolize the city. To identify the city, she inscribed "Knox Indiana" in a bold Helvetica type font, colored in "Redskin red" around her line art rendering of the architectural landmark. This insignia is centered in a field of white silk, edged in gold fringe.  The flag is on display at City Hall.

Rugs from Amazon.comEven if your gaze is primarily towards the stars or the horizon, the laws of gravity compel us to keep our feet firmly on the ground. Throughout history, from the plush beauty of traditional Persian-style rugs to the clean, natural elegance of a bamboo or sea grass mat, we humans have been making the ground under our feet beautiful with rugs, carpets, and runners. Rugs can make wonderful accent pieces to tie in the colors of a room, and they can make even the floor a welcoming and comfortable place to live, relax, and dream. At Amazon.com, you can find a huge selection of rugs in a wide variety of styles and materials. You’ll find everything from braided runners to add a textured look to your hallway, to the clean and modern style of sculptured area rugs, to large and small rectangular rugs. Rugs with handmade tassels can also add a rustic and worldly feeling to any lounge or living room. Choose from a vast selection of silk, sea grass, leather, cotton, wool, acrylic, or chenille pieces. Now you can filter your search by price to see the most budget-friendly products first, and save time and money on your hunt for the right carpets, rugs, and accessories. We also have rugs in a variety of sizes, for a variety of areas and uses. Runners can add color and depth to hallways and breezeways and circular rugs are great for living rooms and under dining tables. We have all sorts of rug accessories, like under pads and carpet grippers, and you can even find fireproof rugs to make your hearth a cozy place while protecting your flooring from flying sparks. Many of our items come with Free Shipping, so you don’t have to worry about extra delivery charges when you’re shopping for accent pieces.Themed rugs are a fun way to express your individual style and unique hobbies. Our sports-themed items are great for the sports lovers in the family. You can find rugs with your favorite football, baseball, basketball, or hockey team logo printed on it to create your own Fan Zone in your family room. We also have many animal-themed pieces, such as elephants, zebra stripes, or birds. A faux-fur bearskin rug makes a great addition to a man cave or a lodge-themed room. Whether you need an accent rug to cozy up a bedroom, or you want a comfortable place to rest your feet on the hearth, make the ground under your feet beautiful and comfortable with the rugs from Amazon.com.
