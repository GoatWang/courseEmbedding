                            Botox
                    

You can tell Dr Michelle is very experienced

Dr Michelle is really good. I had botox for first time. I'm 35. You'd never know I'd done anything to my face but I look younger and fresher but can still move my face! I had botox between the eyebrows for that frown line .. botox works so well on that. I had a faint line apparent in selfies taken in natural light.. completely gone and smooth now. I also got botox for crows feet (side of eyes)...

Never go there, takes only 5minutes to see you, don't even take time to explain you anything. Don't even wait for you to ask any questions but yet they charge you $300 for consultation. The biggest mistake I ever made is going to that doctor

My name is Courtney I am 26 years old and I thank god every day that I found via internet research Dr. Green.  When I went into her office for the first  time I was ready for her to tell me what I already heard.  Fortunately that was not my experience.  Dr. Green listened to my story, and as her eyes watered I perceived her passion for what she does.  At the time as beautiful as I was I had...

                            Botox
                    

I always have an amazing experience here - New York, NY

Every experience and interaction with Dr. Green is exceptional. If you don't like something she manages to always fix it. She always has you come in after any procedure to check on you.  I had dysport done on my forehead and was not pleased. This was the first time trying it. I've always had Botox before. As soon as she saw me she said I needed  Botox and she knew exactly where to inject it....

First time getting injections

Friends recommended Dr Green to me so I called and made an appointment. They were able to take me the same week. I was nervous because I had never gotten filler before. Dr Green did Voluma in my cheeks and I am so happy with how it came out. I have a more youthful look and I feel great. My coworkers said I look really well rested. I plan to go back for another procedure soon.

It is always a great experience when I go to Dr Greens office. I have gotten so comfortable that I am now going to the office for everything. I went last week and got Juvaderm in my lips and they look so natural and great. I didn't have any bruising, I was slightly swollen for a day but it went down and they look amazing. I am so happy

Had coolsculpting before at Dr Greens office and was so happy with my results I went back to do my inner thighs. Again I couldn't be happier. I was out if the office in under 2 hours and went back to work the same day. My results are great and i would recommend this treatment to anyone

I had a great experience with Dr Green having received excellent results with Cool Sculpting about 10 months ago (approximately). I thought I better try some Botox as my forehead frown lines and crows feet were getting a little bad for someone in my particular profession. As always the office reception found me an appropriate appointment that fit my schedule easily, and the injections were...

I had a fabulous experience with Dr Green and her staff from start to finish. I got two procedures done and both were quick and painless. The doctor and staff had answers to  all my questions and concerns. I also was concerned with some bumps on my face a few days after and Dr green asked me to come in the next day to see it and explained it was common and what I could do for it
