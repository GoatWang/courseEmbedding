What Our Customers Think
 


 Thank you for inviting me to the training class yesterday. I think the class was very beneficial! There was a lot of knowledge that I gained throughout the presentation. An idea that really got me thinking about was the "Thanks For Tanks." It's a great idea! Another advantage throughout the presentation was how to calculate specific costs. I would recommend this presentation for business owners all over, who have set goals for their business.Reyan Khanji, Owner of Midwest Fuels 
 Good afternoon, thank you for having me at the dealer meeting. The loss prevention training class was very beneficial to me. I learned a lot from it, plus I think everyone who is getting into this business must take this course. I would love to take more classes like that. It helps us run our businesses more efficiently.Moussa Bazzi, Jefferson Express, PC 5590 
..Thank you for the opportunity to attend the Empire Petroleum PVP educational class in Charlotte, NC. It was a great presentation and very informative. It provided a tremendous amount of information that I was able to bring back with me and utilize in my daily operations here at the store. The food provided at lunch was also totally awesome. Great experience overall! I look forward to attending the next class.Brenda, Battleground, PC 5041 
The Empire Preferred Vendor Program is a real asset to our business. When I was notified AmeriGas was added to the program I was excited about the significant savings we would receive. The difference in price per tank is $3.70 and that is an awesome savings! We are very happy with the PVP program.Gini Winstead, DownEast Travel Center
