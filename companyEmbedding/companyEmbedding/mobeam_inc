MoBeam Announces Its First Consumer Product, the nümi Key | Business Wire


























































MoBeam Announces Its First Consumer Product, the nümi Key




The nümi Key Allows Consumers to Carry All Their 
      Loyalty/Frequent Shopper Cards on One Device








May 11, 2010 02:51 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At FMI 2010, MoBeam Inc. launched its first product, the nümi 
      key.  Chris Sellers, MoBeam CEO says, “The nümi key gives consumers the 
      opportunity to store all of their loyalty/frequent shopper cards on one 
      digital device.  And the best part, the nümi key can be used at any 
      checkout lane with a laser bar code scanner.”



The average US household has more than 14 loyalty/frequent shopper 
      cards and it is growing.  Given the recent economic developments and 
      consumers’ desire for savings, loyalty cards have become an important 
      part of daily life.  However, most consumers are overwhelmed with the 
      rapidly expanding thickness of their wallet due to these cards.  Our 
      research shows that often, consumers miss out on discounts because they 
      just don’t want to carry another card. These challenges are now a thing 
      of the past with the nümi key.  


How does it work?  The nümi key’s patented technology converts any 
      bar code to light that imitates a bar code when beamed into any existing 
      laser bar code scanner.  The nümi key has very successful read rates 
      with bar code scanners.  In contrast, smartphones that generate an image 
      of a bar code often have less than 50% successful read rates at bar code 
      scanners.


Adding cards to the nümi key is simple.  There is no software to 
      install.  Just go to www.myloyaltycards.com, 
      connect your nümi device to your computer with a USB cable, select your 
      retailer from a pull down list, type in your cards’ numbers as they 
      appear and load them to your nümi key. It couldn’t get any easier.


Chris Sellers continues, “This is the beginning of a new consumer 
      shopping experience in which consumers will be able to take advantage of 
      discounts at a new level.  In the very near future Mobeam will offer 
      digital coupons and gift cards on the nümi key.  When we offer coupons, 
      manufacturers and retailers can breathe a sigh of relief, because with 
      the nümi key, the coupon bar code is never revealed, thereby making 
      coupon fraud very difficult.  The nümi key also accomplishes all of this 
      securely.”


The nümi key is available beginning Monday, May 17, 2010 on amazon.com.


Headquartered in Cupertino, California, MoBeam Inc. offers its 
      patented technology to consumers, media companies, brands and retailers 
      in the form of a ‘digital wallet’ in which to securely store, manage and 
      spend the various forms of value. www.mobeam.com.
