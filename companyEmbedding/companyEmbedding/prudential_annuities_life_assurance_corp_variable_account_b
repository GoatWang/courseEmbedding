Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York.

A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.

Annuities Overview














                                                        
                                                       
                                                           What Are Annuities?
                                                        

                                           

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

INSURANCE PRODUCTS SALES AGREEMENT  

THIS AGREEMENT is made this __ day of __________, __, by and among Prudential   
Annuities Life Assurance Corporation ("PALAC"), a Connecticut insurance         
company; Prudential Annuities Distributors, Incorporated ("PAD"), a Delaware    
corporation (PALAC and PAD referred to collectively as "Prudential Annuities"); 
________________________ ("Broker-Dealer"), a ______________ corporation; and   
any and all undersigned insurance agency affiliates of Broker-Dealer            
("Associated Insurance Agencies").                                              

WHEREAS, PALAC offers certain variable annuity contracts, modified        
guaranteed annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies which are     
deemed to be securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act")       
(collectively the "Registered Contracts"), as well as certain fixed and         
variable annuity contracts and life insurance contracts that are exempt from    
registration under the 1933 Act ("Non-Registered Contracts") (Registered        
Contracts and Non-Registered Contracts referred to collectively, as             
"Contracts"); and                                                               

  WHEREAS, PALAC has appointed PAD, a broker-dealer, as the Distributor of the
Registered Contracts; and                                                       

 WHEREAS, Broker-Dealer is a broker-dealer engaged in the sale of securities
and other investment products, including variable insurance products, and is    
licensed in certain states as an insurance agent or agency; and                 

WHEREAS, in those states where Broker-Dealer cannot obtain the necessary  
licenses as an insurance agent or agency, Broker-Dealer has entered into an     
agreement with Associated Insurance Agency to act on its behalf in the capacity 
of insurance agent; and                                                         

  WHEREAS, in the event that Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency are
the same party, the duties, responsibilities and privileges of Associated       
Insurance Agency under this Agreement shall be undertaken by Broker-Dealer; and 

WHEREAS, PALAC and PAD, in their individual capacities, proposes to       
authorize Broker-Dealer and any undersigned Associated Insurance Agency to      
solicit sales of the Contracts and ongoing premium and purchase payments to the 
Contracts;                                                                      

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual promises contained   
herein including the Schedule(s), as amended from time to time, the parties     
hereto agree as follows:                                                        

1. APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION                                                

(a) PALAC and PAD hereby authorize Broker-Dealer to solicit sales of      
Contracts identified in the attached Schedule(s). PALAC hereby appoints         
Broker-Dealer, and any Associated Insurance Agency, in their capacity as        
licensed insurance agency, to solicit sales of the Contracts and ongoing        
premium and purchase payments in all states where PALAC is authorized to do     
business and where Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency is properly 
licensed and appointed on a non-exclusive basis. Broker-Dealer and Associated   
Insurance Agency accept such appointment and authorization, and each agrees to:

(d) Associated Insurance Agency represents and warrants to PALAC that

compensation in connection with the Contracts and for ongoing premiums or       
purchase payments thereon.

Agency (where required) are hereby authorized to designate individual insurance 
agents affiliated with Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance Agency, for the    
purpose of soliciting sales of the Non-Registered Contracts ("Agents").         
Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency shall not recommend a Registered  
Representative or Agent for appointment by PALAC unless such Registered         
Representative or Agent is duly licensed as an insurance agent in the state(s)  
in which it is proposed that such Registered Representative or Agent will       
solicit sales of the Contracts. Registered Representatives and Agents must      
specify with each Contract application, the Broker-Dealer and/or Associated     
Insurance Agency on whose behalf the application has been solicited. If a       
Registered Representative of Broker-Dealer or Agent of Associated Insurance     
Agency is no longer to be treated as the agent of record on a Contract,         
Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance Agency must immediately notify PALAC in   
writing and, within thirty (30) business days of such notice, identify a        
Registered Representative of Broker-Dealer or Agent of Associated Insurance     
Agency who will act as the substitute agent of record.                          

  (b) Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency are solely responsible for
the conduct of Registered Representatives and/or Agents associated with such    
Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency, as well as for monitoring     
ongoing compliance with applicable federal and state laws, rules and            
regulations and applicable NASD Rules. Prudential Annuities is not liable and   
undertakes no obligations under any agreement between Broker-Dealer and         
Registered Representative or Associated Insurance Agency and its Agents unless  
Prudential Annuities has specifically agreed to do so in writing.               

(c) PALAC, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to appoint
any Registered Representative or Agent or, once appointed, to terminate or      
refuse to renew any Registered Representative's or Agent's appointment with     
PALAC. By written notice to Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance Agency, PALAC 
may require Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance Agency to cause Registered    
Representatives or Agents to cease soliciting Contracts and additional premiums 
or purchase payments thereon on behalf of PALAC or require Broker-Dealer or     
Associated Insurance Agency to cancel the appointment by PALAC of any of their  
Registered Representatives or Agents. Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance    
Agency shall notify PAD immediately in writing if any Registered Representative 
appointed by PALAC ceases to be a Registered Representative of Broker-Dealer,   
is disciplined or suspended by FINRA or by Broker-Dealer, or if any Registered  
Representative or Agent ceases to be properly licensed or is the subject of a   
disciplinary proceeding in any state. Further, Broker-Dealer has, follows and   
enforces policies and procedures obligating its Registered Representatives to   
update their FINRA U-4. Broker-Dealer shall promptly notify Prudential          
Annuities if it becomes aware that any Registered Representative who is         
appointed by Prudential Annuities has updated their FINRA Form U4 to disclose a 
conviction that would disqualify them from engaging in the business of          
insurance under 18 USCS Sec. 1033 (Federal Crime Bill) and has not otherwise    
received the consent and/or waiver of an authorized insurance regulator to      
engage in the business of insurance.                                            

(d) Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency represent, warrant and  
certify that, on their own behalf, and as agent on behalf of PALAC, each:       
(i) has performed due diligence in compliance with state law and has duly       
investigated and performed a thorough background check into the character and   
fitness of any Registered Representatives or Agent; (ii) is not aware of any    
felony or misdemeanor convictions in the last 10 years arising out of conduct   
involving embezzlement, fraudulent conversion or misappropriation of funds or   
securities, or involving violations of (S)(S)1341, 1342, or 1343 of Title 18 of 
the United States Code or any subsequent amendments thereto; and (iii) is       
satisfied that each such Registered Representative and/or Agent that            
Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency has designated is trustworthy, 
financially responsible, in good business standing and competent for            
appointment to act as an individual insurance agent of PALAC. Further,          
Broker-Dealer agrees to use reasonable efforts to not knowingly recommend       
anyone for appointment to conduct insurance business who is disqualified from   
engaging in the business of insurance under 18 USCS (S)1033 (Federal Crime      
Bill), or who has not otherwise received consent and/or waiver of an authorized 
insurance regulator to engage in the business of insurance. Broker-Dealer and   
Associated Insurance Agency agree, to the extent permitted by law, to provide   
PALAC with copies of any and all background check reports and any additional    
documentation in connection with the investigation into the background of the   
designated Registered Representative or Agent.

applicable jurisdiction may only solicit Non-Registered Contracts.              

(f) Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency agree to assist PALAC in

applicable state insurance laws. Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency

Associated Insurance Agency shall execute any electronic or telephone

instructions containing unauthorized, incorrect or incomplete information       
received from Broker-Dealer, Associated Insurance Agency, Registered            
Representatives or Agents.

10. COMPENSATION                                                                

(a) PALAC will pay sales and/or service compensation to Broker-Dealer (or,
if required by law, to Associated Insurance Agency) in connection with the      
Contracts according to the terms of the applicable Schedule(s) in effect as of  
the date sales and/or service compensation is payable under the Contract.       
Schedules effective on or after the issue date of a Contract will govern all    
subsequent sales and/or service compensation payable for such Contract on or    
after the Schedule effective date. The amount of compensation payable under any 
Schedule(s), the continued availability of any compensation option(s) and other 
conditions relating to payment of such compensation are subject to change upon  
written notice to Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency, as applicable. 

(b) PALAC provides compensation for sale of the Contracts, as commissions 
and/or asset-based compensation. PALAC may also provide compensation in         
relation to providing information consulting services to Registered Contract    
owners on behalf of PALAC. Information consulting services consist of           
communicating, and where necessary, explaining to Registered Contract owners,   
certain types of statistical information regarding the investment options       
available under the Registered Contracts. Information consulting fees are       
payable for providing such services to Registered Contract owners and not for   
the sale of such Contracts. Information consulting fees may not be payable on   
all Registered Contracts.                                                       

(c) Compensation to the Registered Representatives or Agents by           
Broker-Dealer or the Associated Insurance Agency on Contracts solicited by the  
Registered Representatives or Agents and issued by PALAC will be governed by    
agreements between Broker-Dealer or the Associated Insurance Agency and their   
respective Registered Representatives or Agents. Any payment thereof will be    
the Broker-Dealer's or Associated Insurance Agency's sole responsibility.       

(d) If there is a change in the agent of record after the issue date of a 
Contract, any subsequent compensation payable in connection with such Contract  
will be governed by the compensation option elected by the agent of record at   
the time the Contract was issued.                                               

 (e) Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency expressly authorize PALAC
to charge against all compensation due or to become due to Broker-Dealer or     
Associated Insurance Agency under this Agreement any amount paid or liabilities 
incurred by PALAC under this Agreement that are determined to be due to the     
conduct of Broker-Dealer, Associated Insurance Agency, Registered               
Representatives or Agents. Additionally, PALAC may deduct at any time any       
indebtedness or obligation Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance Agency owes    
PALAC from any monies due under this Agreement that are determined to be due to 
the conduct of Broker-Dealer, Associated Insurance Agency, Registered           
Representatives or Agents                                                       

(f) Prudential Annuities shall not be obligated to pay any compensation   
related to Registered Contracts if Broker-Dealer is disqualified from continued 
registration with FINRA. In such event, Prudential Annuities will hold any such 
compensation from the date of such disqualification, provided Broker-Dealer     
(i) commences an appeal to FINRA within 180 days following the disqualification 
notice; (ii) actively pursues such appeal; and (iii) notifies Prudential        
Annuities of an appeal as well as the outcome of such appeal. Prudential        
Annuities may, at its sole discretion, require documentation regarding the      
outcome of said appeal. Should Broker-Dealer's FINRA registration be            
reinstated, all compensation due or becoming due during the period of           
disqualification shall be immediately paid, without interest, provided such     
payment does not violate any NASD Rules or regulations in effect at the time of 
such payment.                                                                   

(g) Any outstanding indebtedness Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance    
Agency owes PALAC or PAD shall become immediately due and payable upon          
termination of this Agreement.                                                  

(h) Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency may request that     
Prudential Annuities make payment of compensation to an account established by  
and/or in the name of Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency at the   
National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC") or other similar or successor 
entity. If Prudential Annuities agrees to make payment of compensation to such  
account, Prudential Annuities shall only be responsible for following the       
procedures for payment established by the terms of Prudential Annuities'        
agreement(s) with the NSCC. In consideration of Prudential Annuities' agreement 
to make payment to Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency through its 
NSCC account, Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency agree to only    
seek recovery, for amounts due under the Agreement and for which Prudential     
Annuities has made payment

in accordance with NSCC rules, from NSCC. Prudential Annuities shall bear no    
financial responsibility for any amounts properly paid to NSCC on behalf of     
Broker-Dealer and/or Associated Insurance Agency.                               

11.RETURN OF COMPENSATION                                                       

If PALAC is required to refund premiums or purchase payments, or return   
account values on any Contract for any reason, then any compensation otherwise  
payable will be adjusted as set forth in the Schedule(s). Any compensation      
previously paid in connection with such Contract must be repaid to PALAC or PAD 
within thirty (30) business days notice to Broker-Dealer or Associated          
Insurance Agency of such a return of amounts in connection with such Contract.  
Prudential Annuities shall have the right to offset any such returned           
compensation against amounts otherwise payable by Prudential Annuities.         
Prudential Annuities agrees to notify Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance    
Agency within thirty (30) days after any action that results in a charge back   
of compensation.                                                                

12. PAYMENT TO ASSOCIATED INSURANCE AGENCY

they are in compliance with the terms and conditions of one or more no-action   
letters issued by the SEC with respect to an insurance agency associated with a 
registered broker-dealer not registering as a broker-dealer with the SEC. In    
reliance on such representation, Prudential Annuities agrees to pay             
compensation in connection with the Contracts, that would otherwise be payable  
to Broker-Dealer, to the Associated Insurance Agency that is properly state     
licensed. Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency represent and warrant   
that any compensation payable by Prudential Annuities in connection with the    
Contracts shall be distributed by Associated Insurance Agency only to duly      
licensed and properly appointed Registered Representatives and Agents.          

(b) Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency shall notify PAD        
immediately in writing if Broker-Dealer and/or and Associated Insurance Agency  
fail to comply with any such terms and conditions and shall take such measures  
as may be necessary to comply with any such terms and conditions. If Associated 
Insurance Agency is the same party as Broker-Dealer, this Paragraph 12 does not 
apply, and Broker-Dealer shall undertake all the duties, responsibilities and   
privileges under this Agreement.                                                

13. HOLD HARMLESS AND INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS                                

(a) Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency shall indemnify and hold
Prudential Annuities harmless from any liability, loss or expense sustained as  
a result of any acts or omissions, or the violation or noncompliance with any   
applicable federal or state law or regulation or any provision of this          
Agreement by Broker-Dealer, its Registered Representatives and associated       
persons of Broker-Dealer, Associated Insurance Agency and its Agents and any    
employees or affiliated persons, of any of the foregoing, including but not     
limited to, any claim by one or more Agents or Registered Representatives for

Contracts.                                                                      

(b) Prudential Annuities shall indemnify and hold Broker-Dealer and       
Associated Insurance Agency harmless from any liability, loss or expense

noncompliance with any applicable federal or state law or regulation or any     
provision of this Agreement by Prudential Annuities and any employees or        
affiliated persons of Prudential Annuities.

Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency allow Prudential Annuities to     
make such investigation, settlement, or defense thereof as Prudential Annuities 
deems prudent.

No assignment of this Agreement or any duty or compensation payable       
hereunder shall be valid unless authorized by PALAC in writing. Every           
assignment shall be subject to any indebtedness and obligation Broker-Dealer or 
Associated Insurance Agency owes PALAC and any applicable state insurance laws  
or regulations pertaining to such assignments.

 (a) No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless it
is in writing and is signed by all parties hereto. Notwithstanding the above,   
the parties agree that any Schedule(s) to this Agreement may be amended from    
time to time, and that such revised Schedule(s) shall be automatically          
effective upon receipt by Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency.        

(b) Failure of any party to insist on strict compliance with any of the   
conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any of the   
conditions, but the same shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of    
any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a 
waiver of any other provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver    
constitute a continuing waiver. Failure of any party to terminate the Agreement 
for any of the causes set forth in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver  
of that party's right to terminate this Agreement at a later time for any of    
these causes.

(c) Any response by Broker-Dealer or Associated Insurance Agency to an    
individual Contract owner complaint arising out of the conduct of business      
under this Agreement must be sent to Prudential Annuities for its approval      
before being sent to the Contract owner. Any responses to such Contract owner

other limitations contained in Paragraph 13.                                    

19. BOOKS, ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS

regulations related to replacement of contracts or policies of insurance.       

21. CONFIDENTIAL INFORFMATION & PRIVACY                                         

(a) Each Party shall safeguard and hold confidential from disclosure to   
unauthorized parties all "Confidential Information" of any other Party, which   
term "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all information which is in  
any way connected with, derived from or related to the business of such Party,  
including without limitation, any business and financial records, any retail or 
institutional customer information, computer programs, technical data,          
investment information, lists, compilations, compositions, programs, plans,     
devices, descriptions, drawings, methods, techniques, processes, designs,       
theories concepts or ideas, and any information relating to the pricing or      
marketing policy, suppliers or customers of a Party.                            

(b) Confidential Information shall not include information to the extent  
such information is (i) already known to the receiving Party free of any        
restriction at the time obtained, including information in the public domain;   
(ii) subsequently learned from an independent third party free of restriction;  
(iii) known through no wrongful act of either Party; or (iv) independently      
developed by a Party without reference to information which is confidential.    

  (c) For purposes of this Section, only officers, directors, and employees of
Prudential Annuities, the Distributor, the Broker-Dealer and its Affiliates,    
including their respective accountants, auditors, and attorneys, shall be       
authorized parties, provided those individuals have a "need to know" the        
Confidential Information that is                                                

InsProdSalesAgr (Rev 01/08)                                      Page 10 of 14  

P-->EX-99.3(C)11th�Page�of�14TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
consistent with their respective positions and legal obligations and            
responsibilities. Before disclosing any Confidential Information, an authorized 
individual will be advised that such information must be kept confidential.     

(d) In the event that one Party (the "Disclosing Party") is requested or  
required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or       
documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other   
similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information to an          
unauthorized party, the Disclosing Party shall provide the other Parties (the   
"Non-Disclosing Parties") with prompt notice of any such request or requirement 
so that the Non-Disclosing Parties may seek a protective order or other         
appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this          
Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the      
receipt of a waiver by the Non-Disclosing Parties, the Disclosing Party is      
nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, required to disclose Confidential       
Information, the Disclosing Party may, without liability hereunder, disclose    
only that portion of the Confidential Information which such counsel advises    
the Disclosing Party is required to be disclosed, provided that the Disclosing  
Party attempt to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information,  
including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Non-Disclosing Parties,  
at the Non-Disclosing Partys' expense, to obtain an appropriate protective      
order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded  
the Confidential Information.                                                   

(e) Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of a    
breach by it of the provisions of this Section, one or more other Parties will  
suffer irreparable harm and damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to seek 
injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. The  
provisions of this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.     

  (f) Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereby acknowledge that they
are subject to the privacy regulations under Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley  
Act, 15 U.S.C. (S) 6801 et seq., pursuant to which regulations the parties are  
required to obtain certain undertakings from each other with regard to the      
privacy, use and protection of nonpublic personal financial information of      
Broker/Dealer's and/or General Agent's clients or prospective clients or        
Company's insureds or prospective insureds. Therefore, notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that: (1) they   
shall not disclose or use any Client Data except to the extent necessary to     
carry out their obligations under this Agreement and for no other purpose,      
(2) they shall not disclose Client Data to any third party, including, without  
limitation, their respective third party service providers except to the extent 
necessary to carry out their obligations under this Agreement and then only     
with an agreement in writing from the third party to use or disclose such       
Client Data only to the extent necessary to carry out their respective          
obligations under this Agreement and for no other purposes, (3) they shall      
maintain, and shall require all third parties approved under subsection (2) to  
maintain effective information security measures to protect Client Data from    
unauthorized disclosure or use, and (4) they shall provide each other with      
information regarding such security measures upon the reasonable request of the 
other party and promptly provide the other with information regarding any       
failure of such security measures or any security breach related to Client      
Data. The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive termination of    
the Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, Client Data means the        
nonpublic personal information (as defined in 15 U.S.C. (S) 6809(4)) of the     
parties' clients or prospective clients or insureds or prospective insureds     
received by the other party in connection with the performance of its           
obligations under the Agreement, including, but not limited to (I) an           
individual's name, address, e-mail address, IP address, telephone number and/or 
social security number, (II) the fact that an individual has a relationship     
with the other party and their parents, affiliated or subsidiary companies, or  
(III) an individual's account information.

by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act 
of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), its implementing regulations, and related SEC and    
NASD Rules. These requirements, for such Customer Identification Program,       
include requirements to identify and report currency transactions and           
suspicious activity, to verify customer identify, to conduct customer due       
diligence and to

establish and maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering compliance program.

 (b) The Parties further agree to comply with the economic sanction programs
administered by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Financial     
Assets Control ("OFAC") and, to the extent required by such programs, establish 
and maintain a comprehensive compliance program which includes, among other     
things, procedures for checking customer names and wire transfers against OFAC  
lists.                                                                          

(c) The Parties agree to promptly take whatever action is required by law,
regulations, rule or its internal policies whenever it discovers questionable   
activity or potential indications of suspicious activity or questionable        
activity or potential indications of suspicious activity or OFAC matches are    
detected. To the extent requested by a Party discovering questionable activity  
or potential indications of suspicious activity involving the owner of          
beneficial owner of a Contract, the other Parties, to the extent allowed by     
law, shall assist the requesting Party in the investigation of such activity.   

(d) Broker-Dealer agrees to provide Prudential Annuities with an annual   
certification declaring (i) that it has implemented its anti-money laundering   
program in accordance with Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act, and (ii) that it 
or its agent will perform the specified requirements of Broker-Dealer's         
Customer Identification Program in the manner contemplated by Section 326 of    
the USA PATRIOT Act and pertinent regulations thereunder.                       

23. EXPENSES                                                                    

Broker-Dealer and Associated Insurance Agency shall bear all of their     
expenses in performance of this Agreement.

Page 47636SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090 (tel. (202) 551-8090).Applicants' Representations 1. The Contract \1\ is a ``bonus annuity'' that offers a credit of up to 8% of purchase payments (``Contract Credits''). Applicants propose to recapture the Contract Credits under the following circumstances: (a) If the Contract is returned during the free look period, (b) if the Contract Credit was applied within 12 months prior to death (except that PALAC will not recapture the Contract Credit to the extent that the death benefit is equal to the account value, but after the recovery of all or a portion of the Contract Credit, the death benefit would be equal to less than purchase payments minus proportional withdrawals), and (c) if the Contract Credit was applied within 12 months prior to the exercise of the medically-related surrender of the Annuity.\1\ PALAC also offers a ``private label'' version of theContract, called Optimum XTra, which is sold through Linsco/PrivateLedger Corp. References to the ``Contract'' in this application are intended to include that private label version.2. Applicants seek an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940Act exempting them from Sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), and 27(i)(2)(A) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit PALAC to recapture the Contract Credits under the scenarios described above. Applicants request that the order apply to any separate account established in the future by PALAC (``FutureAccount'') that supports variable annuity contracts offered by PALAC in the future that are substantially similar in all material respects to the Contract (``Future Contracts''). Applicants also request that the order extend to any FINRA member broker-dealer controlling, controlled by, or under common control with PALAC, whether existing or created in the future, that serves as a distributor or principal underwriter of the Contract offered through the Account or any Future Account(``Broker-Dealers''). Applicants also request that the order extend to any broker-dealers that are FINRA-registered and not affiliated withPALAC or the Broker-Dealers (the ``Unaffiliated Broker-Dealers''). EachUnaffiliated Broker-Dealer will have entered into a dealer agreement with PAD or an affiliate of PAD prior to offering the Contract. 3. The Contract is a flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts that is registered on Form N-4 (file no. 333-150220). The minimum initial purchase payment is $10,000, and any additional purchase payment must be at least $100 (except for contract owners who participate in certain periodic purchase payment programs). The maximum issue age for the Contract is 75, meaning that (a) the owner must be 75 or younger, or (b) for a Contract that is entity-owned, the annuitant must be 75 or younger. 4. There are various insurance features under the Contract and charges associated with those features. There is a mortality and expense risk charge equal to 1.60% annually, and an administration charge equal to 0.15% annually. There is a maintenance fee equal to the lesser of $35 or 2% of account value, which is assessed annually on theContract's anniversary date or upon surrender. PALAC imposes no fee with respect to the first 20 transfers in an annuity year, but after the 20th such transfer, currently imposes a fee of $10 per transfer($15 maximum). There is a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') under the Contract, the amount of which is based on the number of years that have elapsed since the issue date of the annuity. The CDSC begins at 9% in year one, and each year thereafter is equal, respectively, to 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, with no CDSC in years 11 and later.No CDSC is imposed on the portion of a withdrawal that can be taken as part of the free withdrawal feature of the Contract. The maximum free withdrawal amount available in each annuity year is equal to 10% of all purchase payments that are subject to a CDSC. Earnings are not subject to any CDSC, and thus are not considered part of the free withdrawal.No CDSC is imposed in any situation in which Applicants recapture aContract Credit. 5. A Contract owner may select one or more of several optional living benefits. The Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit, which offers lifetime payments based on a guaranteed protected value, is subject to a charge of 0.50% per year of the average protected income value each year. The Lifetime Five Income Benefit (which allows the owner to withdraw a specified protected value through periodic withdrawals or as a series of payments for life) is subject to a charge of 0.60% annually of the average daily net assets in the sub-accounts. The Contract also offers a variant of the Lifetime Five benefit (called ``SpousalLifetime Five'') that, for a charge of 0.75% annually, guarantees income until the second-to-die of two individuals married to each other. There is yet another variant called Highest Daily Lifetime Five, under which the protected withdrawal value is based on a highest daily account value and which bears a charge of 0.60% annually. There are other lifetime withdrawal benefits called Highest Daily Lifetime Seven,Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven, Highest Daily Lifetime Seven withBeneficiary Income Option, Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven withBeneficiary Income Option, and Highest Daily Lifetime Seven withLifetime Income Accelerator. The charges for these benefits range from 0.60% to 0.95% of the Protected Withdrawal Value under the benefit. TheContract offers two guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits, called the Guaranteed Return Option Plus 2008 and Highest Daily GuaranteedReturn Option, for which PALAC imposes a charge equal to 0.35% annually, applied against the account value in the sub-accounts.Finally, the Contract offers a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for a charge of 0.35% annually, applied against the account value in the sub-accounts. 6. The Contract offers several optional death benefits, including the Enhanced Beneficiary Protection Death Benefit for a charge of 0.25% annually, the Highest Anniversary Value Death Benefit for a charge of 0.25% annually, a Combination 5% roll-up and Highest Anniversary ValueDeath Benefit for a charge of 0.50% annually, and a Highest Daily ValueDeath Benefit for a charge of 0.50% annually. 7. Applicants may add other optional living and death benefits to the Contract in the future. In addition to the optional insurance features, the Contract offers several optional administrative features at no additional cost (e.g., auto rebalancing and systematic withdrawals). 8. The Contract offers variable investment options and a companion market-value adjustment option that is registered on Form S-3 (file no. 333-136996). At present, the Contract offers portfolios of AdvancedSeries Trust (formerly, American Skandia Trust), INVESCO AIM VariableInsurance Funds, Evergreen Variable Annuity Trust, First DefinedPortfolio Fund, Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust,Nationwide Variable Insurance Trust, and Wells Fargo Variable Trust.Under the Contract, Applicants reserve the right to add new underlying funds and series, and to substitute new portfolios for existing portfolios (subject to Commission approval). 9. An owner choosing to annuitize under the Contract will have only fixed annuity options available. Those fixed
Page 47637annuity options include annuities offering payments for life, payments based on joint lives, payments for life with a certain period, and fixed payments for a certain period. The latest annuitization date is the first day of the month coinciding with, or immediately following the later of the annuitant's 95th birthday or the fifth annuity anniversary. 10. Under the Contract, PALAC will apply a Contract Credit to theContract owner's account value with respect to any purchase payment made during the first six years that the Contract has been in effect.Purchase payments made in the seventh year of the Contract and later will not receive any Contract Credit. The amount of the Contract Credit is determined by the year in which the purchase payment is made and the amount of purchase payments that already have been made under theContract (aka ``cumulative'' purchase payments). Once purchase payments total $100,000 or more, the Contract Credit is 8% in year one of theContract, 6% in year two, 4% in year three, 3% in year four, 2% in year five, and 1% in year six. So long as cumulative purchase payments amount to less than $100,000, the Contract Credit is 6% in year one of the Contract, 5% in year two, 4% in year three, 3% in year four, 2% in year five and 1% in year six. PALAC will pay Contract Credits from its general account assets. PALAC will allocate each Contract Credit to the variable investment options in the same proportion that the corresponding purchase payment is allocated to such options. 11. With respect to Contracts issued on or after the date of theCommission order under this application, Applicants wish to recapture the full amount of any Contract Credit under the scenarios identified in the following sentence. Specifically, Applicants will recapture aContract Credit if (a) the Contract is surrendered during the free look period, or (b) the Contract Credit was applied within 12 months prior to death (except that PALAC will not recapture the Contract Credit to the extent that the death benefit is equal to the account value, but after the recovery of all or a portion of the Contract Credit, the death benefit would be equal to less than purchase payments minus proportional withdrawals) or (c) the Contract Credit was applied within 12 months prior to the surrender of the Contract under the medically- related surrender provision (e.g., if the owner is diagnosed with a``fatal illness'' and chooses to invoke this contract provision on that basis). (The medically-related surrender feature is not available inNew York.)Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from the provisions of the 1940Act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 2. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, issue an order to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of the Contract Credits under the circumstances described above. Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 3. Applicants submit that the recapture of the Contract Credits will not raise concerns under Sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The Contract Credits will be recaptured only if the owner (a) exercises his/her free look right,(b) dies within 12 months after receiving the Contract Credit (except as described above), or (c) makes a medically-related surrender within 12 months after receiving the Contract Credit. The amounts recaptured equal the Contract Credit provided by PALAC from its own general account assets. 4. Applicants argue that when PALAC recaptures the Contract Credit, it is merely retrieving its own assets, and the owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the Account's assets, because his or her interest in the Contract Credit amount has not vested. With respect to a Contract Credit recaptured upon the exercise of the free- look privilege, it would be unfair to allow an owner exercising that privilege to retain the Contract Credit under a Contract that has been returned for a refund after a period of only a few days. If PALAC could not recapture the Contract Credit during the free look period, individuals could purchase a Contract with no intention of retaining it, and simply return it for a quick profit. Applicants also note that the Contract owner is entitled to retain any investment gain attributable to the Contract Credit, even if the Contract Credit is ultimately recaptured. Furthermore, the recapture of the ContractCredit if death or a medically-related surrender occurs within 12 months after receipt of a Contract Credit is designed to provide PALAC with a measure of protection against ``anti-selection.'' The risk here is that an owner, with full knowledge of impending death or serious illness, will make very large payments and thereby leave PALAC less time to recover the cost of the Contract Credit, to PALAC's financial detriment. 5. Applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of theContract Credit does not, and any such Future Contract provisions will not, violate Sections 2(a)(32) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the 1940 Act, andRule 22c-1 thereunder. 6. The recapture of a Contract Credit could be viewed as involving the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of an Account. Applicants state that the recapture of the Contract Credit does not involve either of the evils that Rule 22c-1 was intended to address, namely: (a) The dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or redemption or repurchase at a price above it, and (b) other unfair results, including speculative trading practices.Applicants assert that the proposed recapture of the Contract Credit does not pose a threat of dilution. To effect a recapture of a ContractCredit, interests in an owner's account will be redeemed at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value. The amount recaptured will equal the amount of the Contract Credit that PALAC paid out of its general account assets. Although the owner will be entitled to retain any investment gain attributable to a Contract Credit, the amount of that gain will be determined on the basis of current net asset value. Therefore, no dilution will occur upon the recapture of aContract Credit. Applicants also submit that the second harm that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address, namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing, will not occur as a result of the recapture of a Contract Credit. 7. Applicants submit that their request for an order that applies to the Account or any Future Accounts established by PALAC in connection with the issuance of Contracts and Future Contracts, and underwritten or distributed by PAD or other broker-dealers, is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative
Page 47638expenses and maximizing the efficient use of Applicants' resources.Investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection by requiring Applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issue under the 1940 Act that has not already been addressed in this application. Having Applicants file additional applications would impair Applicants' ability effectively to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. 8. Applicants undertake that Future Contracts funded by the Account or by Future Accounts that seek to rely on the order issued pursuant to the application will be substantially similar to the Contract in all material respects.ConclusionApplicants submit that their request for an order meets the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act and that an order should, therefore, be granted.For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.Florence E. Harmon,Acting Secretary.

asap Iii - PrudentialGENPROD2 PRUCO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY PRUCO LIFE FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT PRUCO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY PRUCO LIFE of NEW JERSEY FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT PRUDENTIAL ANNUITIES LIFE ASSURANCE CORPORATION PRUDENTIAL ANNUITIES LIFE ASSURANCE CORPORATION VARIABLE ACCOUNT B Supplement, dated November 1, 2012, to Prospectuses dated May 1, and August 20, 2012 This Supplement should be read and retained with the Prospectus for your Annuity. This supplement is intended to update certain information in the Prospectus for the variable annuity you own and is not intended to be a prospectus or offer for any other variable annuity listed here that you do not own. If you would like another copy of the current Prospectus, please call us at 1-888-PRU-2888. We are issuing this supplement to reflect changes to the Advanced Series Trust: (1) the addition of Security Capital Research & Management Incorporated as a sub-subadvisor to the AST J.P. Morgan Global Thematic Portfolio, * which is expected to occur on or about November 30, 2012; and (2) revisions to the Investment Objectives/Policies of the AST New Discovery Asset Allocation Portfolio. Accordingly, the Investment Objectives/Policies table that appears in the Prospectus section titled “Investment Options” is modified as follows: STYLE/ TYPE AST Funds Asset Allocation INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES/POLICIES AST J.P. Morgan Global Thematic Portfolio: (formerly AST Horizon Growth Asset Allocation Portfolio): seeks capital appreciation consistent with its specified level of risk tolerance. The Portfolio will provide exposure to a long-term strategic asset allocation while having the flexibility to express shorter-term tactical views by capitalizing upon market opportunities globally. The Portfolio will invest across a broad range of asset classes, including, without limitation, domestic equity and debt, international and global developed equity, emerging markets equity and debt, high yield debt, convertible bonds, and real estate investment trusts. The Portfolio will invest primarily in individual securities in order to meet its investment objective and will also utilize derivative instruments for tactical positioning and risk management. Under normal circumstances, approximately 65% of the Portfolio’s net assets (ranging between 55-75% depending on market conditions) will be invested to provide exposure to equity securities and approximately 35% of its net assets (ranging between 25-45% depending on market conditions) will be invested to provide exposure to fixed-income securities. Such exposures may be obtained through: (i) the purchase of “physical” securities (e.g., common stocks, bonds, etc.); (ii) the use of derivatives (e.g., options and futures contracts on indices, securities, and commodities, currency forwards, etc.); and (iii) the purchase of certain exchange-traded funds. 1 PORTFOLIO ADVISOR/ SUBADVISOR J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc./ Security Capital Research & Management Incorporated * The AST J.P. Morgan Global Thematic Portfolio is not available with the Optimum suite of Annuities. Therefore, the disclosure changes for the AST J.P. Morgan Global Thematic Portfolio that are described in this Supplement do not apply to your Prospectus if you own an Optimum, Optimum Four, Optimum Plus or Optimum XTra Annuity.Page 2 and 3: STYLE/ TYPE AST Funds Asset AllocatPage 4 and 5: This change has no effect on amountPage 6 and 7: 1 Effective August 20, 2012, the ASPage 8 and 9: ADVANCED SERIES ADVISOR PLAN SM IIIPage 10 and 11: CONTENTS GLOSSARY OF TERMS ........Page 12 and 13: APPENDIX G - FORMULA UNDER HIGHEST Page 14 and 15: GLOSSARY OF TERMS Many terms used wPage 16 and 17: Highest Daily Lifetime 6 Plus IncomPage 18 and 19: SUMMARY OF CONTRACT FEES AND CHARGEPage 20 and 21: The following table sets forth the Page 22 and 23: YOUR OPTIONAL BENEFIT FEES AND CHARPage 24 and 25: YOUR OPTIONAL BENEFIT FEES AND CHARPage 26 and 27: Highest Anniversary Value Death BenPage 28 and 29: UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO UNDERLYING MUTPage 30 and 31: UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO UNDERLYING MUTPage 32 and 33: EXPENSE EXAMPLES These examples arePage 34 and 35: SUMMARY Advanced Series Advisor PlaPage 36 and 37: These benefits contain detailed proPage 38 and 39: Distribution Charge: For ASAP III aPage 40 and 41: continue to participate in those opPage 42 and 43: Permitted Portfolios AST PIMCO LimiPage 44 and 45: STYLE/ TYPE LARGE CAP VALUE FIXED IPage 46 and 47: STYLE/ TYPE ASSET ALLOCA- TION ASSEPage 48 and 49: STYLE/ TYPE INTER- NATIONAL EQUITY Page 50 and 51: STYLE/ TYPE MID CAP GROWTH MID CAP Page 52 and 53: STYLE/ TYPE ASSET ALLOCA- TION ASSEPage 54 and 55: STYLE/ TYPE ASSET ALLOCA- TION FIXEPage 56 and 57: STYLE/ TYPE MODERATE ALLO- CATION IPage 58 and 59: STYLE/ TYPE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES/PPage 60 and 61: STYLE/ TYPE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES/PPage 62 and 63: STYLE/ TYPE SPECIALTY INVESTMENT OBPage 64 and 65: MVA Fixed Allocations.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.
