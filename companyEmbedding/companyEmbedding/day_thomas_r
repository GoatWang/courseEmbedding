It will sit on the coffee table in our living room for many years to come."—Chris Stewart, co-author of The Miracle of Freemdom and Seven Miracles that Saved AmericaHave you ever tried to read the Declaration of Independence or the
Constitution, but found them difficult to understand? Would you

  Priceless!By Courtney, Submitted on 2015-02-25The format of these books is just amazing.  Great American Documents includes documents like  The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution, Washington’s Farewell Address, The Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address, “I Have a Dream” speech by Martin Luther King,  Reagan’s speech honoring the men of World War II “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc” and many many more.  But it’s just so much more than transcripts and text from those important documents....

  A MUST for your family libraryBy K, Submitted on 2015-02-25As part of the introduction To the Young Reader: "This book will help you better understand that freedom 'belongs to all mankind' (D&C 98:5) and that the United States of America stands in defense of freedom and liberty."  
Including pictures, maps, charts, definitions of unfamiliar words, and explanations of context, this volume is a wonderful resource for families to learn together about the inspired documents and the great men and women who laid the principles of freedom of this "choice land"--the United States of America.
How grateful I am, as a parent, to have this treasure as I teach my children about our precious heritage and the responsibility we have to uphold it.  I highly recommend it! 
 




  What a treasure!By Shauna, Submitted on 2015-02-25I've been telling everyone about this book. I love it. Finally a way to understand some of the important documents and speeches in American history. Thank you.

 Product Description 

            Help your family really enjoy an important but oft-neglected book of scripture! This volume follows the format of the previous volumes in the series that includes The Book of Mormon for Latter-day Saint Families. Space considerations make it impossible to include the text of the entire Old Testament. However, the book features selections from each book in the Old Testament, including numerous stories and other key passages. It is filled with beautiful illustrations, photographs, helpful charts, and other wonderful aids, such as insights from living prophets, word helps, historical background, and thought-provoking questions that will make reading the Old Testament with your family more rewarding than ever before. The selections and the helps included were written especially with children and grandchildren in mind.

  Waste of moneyBy Derek, Submitted on 2015-02-25Keep your money. While the other books in the series are an excellent family resource, they skip swathes of chapters. We bought it as a family and read from it for our family scripture reading. We only noticed that they skipped entire chapters and give a (frankly inaccurate) summary of them.  Temple-related chapters in Exodus are completely overlooked. It's like the editors don't understand what the modern relevance is so they just leave it out and summarize what they think it means. Who gave them the right to say what is relevant to my family and what isn't? We've reverted back to the KJV. I want my money back.
 




  Outstanding bookBy William, Submitted on 2015-02-25I purchased my copy used (in just like new condition) at a bargain store for $8.00. It looks fantastic to me. There are no duplicated pages and no missing pages to the best of my knowledge, at least not the ones the one reviewer mentioned. It is beautifully done and is great reading. Yes, there are a lot of missing verses, but what I see are the verses that we really need, not all the genealogy stuff and other like verses that can put some people, especially kids, to sleep. One can use the official KJV to get those verses that need no explanation.
 




  Very DisappointedBy Ronald, Submitted on 2015-02-25We have purchased every book in this series and have enjoyed each a great deal. This has not been the case with the Old Testament for Latter-day Saint Families. The parts and chapters that were there, were excellent; however, the book summarizes so many chapters, verses and in some cases, whole books that it leaves you wondering why you purchased it. I feel the authors and publishers should have made a vol 1 and vol 2, rather then take away from the "plain and precious truths". You are better off buying an Old Testament commentary and studing your own KJV Old Testament.
 




  Great BookBy Suzanne, Submitted on 2015-02-25Great Book for Understanding the Old Testament when studying with your family.  We had one problem.  Pages 535-550 were duplicated and pages 551-566 were missing.  Check your copy!
 




  A wonderful addition to the series.By Christopher, Submitted on 2015-02-25My copy just arrived a this afternoon, and I am delighted to say that it is every bit as nice as the other 'For Latter Day Saint Families' editions they have put out in the past few years.   Now my library is complete with the Old Testiment, New Testimant, Book of Mormon and Church History editions.   When it is time for Family Scripture Reading, these volumes have proven their worth time and time again!

Overview
Investigate biblical prophecy with Anglican minister and Cambridge scholar Thomas Rawson Birks. In these classic volumes you’ll find Birks’ insights and exposition on the prophecies found in Isaiah, Daniel, and Revelation.
Not one to shy away from controversial topics, Birks wrote and studied extensively on biblical prophecy and the Apocalypse. Of prophecies he writes, “they serve to link into harmonious union the precepts of the Law and the promises of the gospel. They give a freedom and dignity to the obedience of the Christian, by admitting him to a glimpse of the counsels of the most high, and raising him to the high honor of being a fellow-worker with God. They shield the grace of the gospel from licentious abuse, by exhibiting the severest warnings of judgment to those who corrupt and pervert its sacred privileges.”
Now you can explore the complex world of biblical prophecy with Birks’ writings, and acquaint yourself with nineteenth-century Apocalypse studies. Gain perspective as Birks addresses the writing of many of his contemporaries, and puts forth his own ideas on these sensitive subjects. Included are his historical expositions of the four kingdoms and later visions of Daniel, commentary and a revised translation of Isaiah, and discussion of the prophecy of Revelation. Birks also speaks into some challenging aspects of Christian belief—discussing controversial points within creation, the fall, redemption, and judgment.

Thomas Birks discusses some of the challenging aspects of Christian belief about creation, free will, sin, redemption, and judgment. As Birks states in the preface, the object of his text is to “remove some of those difficulties which have often haunted thoughtful and inquiring minds, when they reflect on the deeper truths and more solemn aspects of religion, both natural and revealed. . . . The aim of these pages is not to awaken the sense of difficulties in [the readers’] minds, but to relieve the depth of these shadows, where they have been felt in their chilling and depressing power. In the hope that the views here partly unfolded, and which are not hastily entertained may be to some weary spirits like a streak of morning light upon the distant mountains when the gloom of night is passing away, they are committed to the blessing of the true Fountain of all wisdom.”
Contents:

On the Knowledge of God
On the Power of God
On the Nature of Evil
On the Creation of Free Agents

Author: Thomas R. Birks
Publisher: William Edward Painter

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Birk exposits the “first elements” of the symbolical prophecies of Daniel and John, the prophecy of Jesus, and a few predictions in the writings of Paul. He states his object as being “to secure firm footing at every step, and, avoiding more doubtful questions, to establish the first elements of prophetic truth on clear and logical grounds of Scripture evidence and solid reason.” He helps readers unpack these kinds of prophecies, that “refer more immediately to the Church of Christ, in its actual state and present dangers,” and “endeavored to remove some of those prejudices and objections, which have lately been repeated in various forms, and have tended to obscure even the simplest conclusions that had been previously drawn from the inspired predictions.” Birks designs his work to serve as an introduction to works on these prophecies from writers such as Mede, Daubauz, Cressener, and Faber.
