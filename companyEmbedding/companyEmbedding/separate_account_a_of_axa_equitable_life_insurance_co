Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

Retirement

Retirement information and strategies for each stage of life







Overview


All Products


View By Product Type









Retirement is one of the key financial goals for many people.  Saving early and often is important.  So is taking advantage of products and accounts designed specifically for retirement.
Tax advantages are a key feature of annuities, IRAs and employer sponsored retirement savings plans, such as 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans.  Any earnings growth in these products is generally tax-deferred until you make withdrawals, generally when you are retired and may well be in a lower tax bracket. 
What's more, your contributions to IRAs and employer retirement plans may be made pretax or may be tax deductible, helping reduce your current tax bill.  Annuities
An annuity is long-term retirement product that can help protect you against the risk of outliving your assets. It is a contract between you and an insurance company: you receive future income in return for your contributions.
Any earnings on contributions are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn, usually at retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket. You may receive income in a number of ways, including payments that will last for as long as you live. Annuities can be a valuable addition to your retirement plan. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, which include, but are not limited to, mortality and expense risk charges, sales and surrender charges, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. Amounts in a variable annuity's investment portfolios are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk including loss of principal. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.

How annuities can help you
Annuities offer many features that can help you to:

Receive retirement income payments for as long as you live
Protect beneficiaries with a death benefit  
Diversify your investments
Provide an opportunity for growth on a tax-deferred basis
Avoid outliving your assets


Variable annuities
Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferred accumulation and future income.
Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take more risk with their money in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is more risk associated with a variable annuity, many variable annuities offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost (depending on contract rider availability). These guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or safety of amounts held in the variable investment options.  Variable annuities offer:

Tax-deferred growth potentialTaxes are deferred on earnings until money is withdrawn. 
The opportunity for market appreciationA variety of investment options are available. 
Access to account valueMost variable annuities allow withdrawal of a portion of your account value without penalty. Withdrawals may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge within the first several years of any contribution, and if taken prior to age 59½, will be subject to a 10 percent IRS penalty.
Benefits to beneficiaries Death benefits paid directly to a named beneficiary are not subject to probate.
Benefits to spousesSpousal beneficiaries may continue the contract and its tax deferral, if this option is chosen.

Please consider the charges, risks, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Individual Retirement Accounts
IRAs are savings plans that enable you to defer paying taxes on the any earnings growth until you actually withdraw the money, after age 59 1/2. There are different types of IRAs, each with their own tax implications and eligibility requirements. The two primary types of IRAs are:

Traditional IRAs Contributions may lower your taxable income and earnings grow tax deferred until withdrawn, usually at retirement when you may be in a lower income bracket. 
Roth IRAs Contributions do not lower your taxable income, but qualified earnings can be withdrawn tax-free. 

Learn more about IRAs from AXA Advisors, LLCEmployer sponsored plans
For many people, their 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b) plan is a significant way to plan and save for retirement. They allow people to put a portion of their annual income into investment accounts specifically for retirement.
Tax free investment growth potential is one of their key features. Combined with other investment products, our plans can be an important part of an overall retirement strategy.

Life insurance: a multi-purpose financial tool
Life insurance is designed primarily to protect your family’s financial security after you die. But your needs change and some types of insurance can offer you access to assets to meet needs during your lifetime. So it’s a smart addition to any financial plan — because it can serve different functions within your overall investment strategy.
Security for your family should something happen to you
Life insurance can help:

Pay debts and taxes after your death
Allow your family to maintain its standard of living 
Support your dependents’ goals and dreams 
Provide immediate access to cash1 

Should your need for a death benefit decrease, certain types of life insurance may serve to provide funds for other needs.  Please discuss these options with your financial professional.
A must-have for your financial plan
No matter what kind of life insurance you choose, there’s no substitute for the peace of mind it can provide. Life insurance is one of the ways you can protect your family’s financial security should something happen to you. Talk to your financial professional/licensed insurance agent about your long-term needs, and he or she can help you determine:

Which type of insurance is right for you
How much protection you and your family need

How to make the most of your premium dollars


How much life insurance do you need?
One very simple way to get a rough estimate may be to base the amount of insurance on your current, after-tax income (since life insurance is generally paid out tax free). Multiply that by the number of years your beneficiaries will need the income. Remember to make an allowance for inflation. 
But there is no substitute for a careful evaluation and review of your life insurance needs with your financial advisor.  If you aren't yet working with a financial professional, we can have someone contact you.

Life Insurance: is not a deposit of any bank; is not FDIC insured; is not insured by any federal government agency; is not guaranteed by any bank or savings association.
1 Withdrawals and loans from life insurance policies may be subject to fees, penalties, and income taxes depending on the specific life insurance policy and the policyholder’s tax situation. Withdrawals reduce the policy value and death benefit. Loans taken from the policies also accrue interest, which will further decrease the policy's cash value and death benefit.
Life insurance and annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (AXA Equitable) and by various unaffiliated carriers through AXA Network, LLC and its subsidiaries. Co-distributed by AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC, members FINRA, SIPC.AXA Equitable, AXA Network, AXA Distributors and AXA Advisors are affiliated companies. All guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable. The guarantees do not apply to the investment portfolios. AXA Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries do not provide tax or legal advice.

Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
